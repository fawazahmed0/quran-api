1|1|In the name of the most merciful God
1|2|Praise be to God, the Lord of all creatures
1|3|the most merciful
1|4|the king of the day of judgment
1|5|Thee do we worship, and of Thee do we beg assistance
1|6|Direct us in the right way
1|7|in the way of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; not of those against whom Thou art incensed, nor of those who go astray
2|1|M
2|2|There is no doubt in this book; it is a direction to the pious
2|3|who believe in the mysteries of faith, who observe the appointed times of prayer, and distribute alms out of what We have bestowed on them
2|4|and who believe in that revelation, which hath been sent down unto thee, and that which hath been sent down unto the prophets before thee, and have firm assurance in the life to come
2|5|these are directed by their Lord, and they shall prosper
2|6|As for the unbelievers, it will be equal to them whether thou admonish them, or do not admonish them; they will not believe
2|7|God hath sealed up their hearts and their hearing; a dimness covereth their sight, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment
2|8|There are some who say, We believe in God, and the last day; but are not really believers
2|9|they seek to deceive God, and those who do believe, but they deceive themselves only, and are not sensible thereof
2|10|There is an infirmity in their hearts, and God hath increased that infirmity; and they shall suffer a most painful punishment, because they have disbelieved
2|11|When one saith unto them, act not corruptly in the earth; they reply, Verily we are men of integrity
2|12|Are not they themselves corrupt doers? But they are not sensible thereof
2|13|And when one saith unto them, believe ye as others believe; they answer, shall we believe as fools believe? Are not they themselves fools? But they know it not
2|14|When they meet those who believe, they say, we do believe: But when they retire privately to their devils, they say, we really hold with you, and only mock at those people
2|15|God shall mock at them, and continue them in their impiety; they shall wander in confusion
2|16|These are the men who have purchased error at the price of true direction: But their traffick hath not been gainful, neither have they been rightly directed
2|17|They are like unto one who kindleth a fire, and when it hath enlightened all around him; God taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness, they shall not see
2|18|they are deaf, dumb, and blind, therefore will they not repent
2|19|Or like a stormy cloud from heaven, fraught with darkness, thunder, and lightning, they put their fingers in their ears, because of the noise of the thunder, for fear of death; God encompasseth the infidels
2|20|the lightning wanteth but little of taking away their sight; so often as it enlighteneth them, they walk therein, but when darkness cometh on them, they stand still; and if God so pleased, he would certainly deprive them of their hearing and their sight, for God is almighty
2|21|O men of Mecca serve your Lord who hath created you, and those who have been before you peradventure ye will fear Him
2|22|who hath spread the earth as a bed for you, and the heaven as a covering, and hath caused water to descend from heaven, and thereby produced fruits for your sustenance. Set not up therefore any equals unto God, against your own knowledge
2|23|If ye be in doubt concerning that revelation which We have sent down unto our servant, produce a chapter like unto it, and call upon your witnesses, besides God, if ye say truth
2|24|But if ye do it not, nor shall ever be able to do it; justly fear the fire whose fewel is men and stones, prepared for the unbeliebers
2|25|But bear good tidings unto those who believe, and do good works, that they shall have gardens watered by rivers; so often as they eat of the fruit thereof for sustenance, they shall say, this is what we have formerly eaten of; and they shall be supplied with several sorts of fruit having a mutual resemblance to one another. There shall they enjoy wives subject to no impurity, and there shall they continue for ever
2|26|Moreover God will not be ashamed to propound in a parable a gnat, or even a more despicable thing; for they who believe will know it to be the truth from their Lord; but the unbelievers will say, What meaneth God by this parable? He will thereby mislead many, and will direct many thereby: but He will not mislead any thereby, except the transgressors
2|27|who make void the covenant of God after the establishing thereof, and cut in sunder that which God hath commanded to be joined, and act corruptly in the earth; they shall perish
2|28|How is it that ye believe not in God? Since ye were dead, and He gave you life; He will hereafter cause you to die, and will again restore you to life; then shall ye return unto Him
2|29|It is He who hath created for you whatsoever is on earth, and then set his mind to the creation of heaven, and formed it into seven heavens; He knoweth all things
2|30|When thy Lord said unto the angels, I am going to place a substitute on earth; they said, Wilt thou place there one who will do evil therein, and shed blood? But we celebrate thy praise, and sanctify Thee. God answered, verily I know that which ye know not
2|31|and He taught Adam the names of all things, and then proposed them to the angels, and said, declare unto Me the names of these things if ye say truth
2|32|They answered, praise be unto thee, we have no knowledge but what Thou teachest us, for Thou art knowing and wise
2|33|God said, O Adam, tell them their names. And when he had told them their names, God said, did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and know that which ye discover, and that which ye conceal
2|34|And when We said unto the angels, worship Adam; they all worshipped him, except Eblis who refused, and was puffed up with pride, and became of the number of unbelievers
2|35|And We said, O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in the garden, and eat of the fruit thereof plentifully wherever ye will; but approach not this tree, lest ye become of the number of the transgressors
2|36|But Satan caused them to forfeit paradise, and turned them out of the state of happiness wherein they had been; whereupon We said, get ye down, the one of you an enemy unto the other, and there shall be a dwelling place for you in earth, and a provision for a season
2|37|And Adam learned words of prayer from his Lord, and God turned unto him, for He is easy to be reconciled and merciful
2|38|We said, get ye all down from hence; hereafter shall there come unto you a direction from me, and whoever shall follow my direction, on them shall no fear come, neither shall they be grieved
2|39|but they who shall be unbelievers, and accuse our signs of falsehood, they shall be the companions of hell fire, therein shall they remain for ever
2|40|O children of Israel, remember my favour wherewith I have favoured you; and perform your covenant with me, and I will perform my covenant with you; and revere me
2|41|and believe in the revelation which I have sent down, confirming that which is with you, and be not the first who believe not therein, neither exchange my signs for a small price; and fear me
2|42|Cloath not the truth with vanity, neither conceal the truth against your own knowledge
2|43|observe the stated times of prayer, and pay your legal alms, and bow down yourselves with those who bow down
2|44|Will ye command men to do justice, and forget your own souls? Yet ye read the book of the law: Do ye not therefore understand
2|45|Ask help with perseverance and prayer; this indeed is grievous, unless to the humble
2|46|who seriously think they shall meet their Lord, and that to Him they shall return
2|47|O children of Israel, remember my favour wherewith I have favoured you, and that I have preferred you above all nations
2|48|Dread the day wherein one soul shall not make satisfaction for another soul, neither shall any intercession be accepted from them, nor shall any compensation be received, neither shall they be helped
2|49|Remember when we delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who grievously oppressed you, they slew your male children, and let your females live: Therein was a great trial from your Lord
2|50|And when we divided the sea for you and delivered you, and drowned Pharaoh's people while ye looked on
2|51|And when we treated with Moses forty nights; then ye took the calf for your God, and did evil
2|52|yet afterwards we forgave you, that preadventure ye might give thanks
2|53|And when we gave Moses the book of the law, and the distinction between good and evil, that peradventure ye might be directed
2|54|And when Moses said unto his people, O my people, verily ye have injured your own souls, by your taking the calf for your God; therefore be turned unto your Creator, and slay those among you who have been guilty of that crime; this will be better for you in the sight of your Creator; and thereupon He turned unto you, for He is easy to be reconciled, and merciful
2|55|And when ye said, O Moses, we will not believe thee, untill we see God manifestly; therefore a punishment came upon you, while ye looked on
2|56|then we raised you to life after ye had been dead, that peradventure ye might give thanks
2|57|And We caused clouds to overshadow you, and manna and quails to descend upon you, saying, eat of the food things which We have given you for food: And they injured not Us, but injured their own souls
2|58|And when We said, enter into this city, and eat of the provisions thereof plentifully as ye will; and enter the gate worshipping, and say, forgiveness! We will pardon you your sins, and give increase unto the well-doers
2|59|But the ungodly changed the expression into another, different from what had been spoken unto them; and we sent down upon the ungodly indignation from heaven, because they had transgressed
2|60|And when Moses asked drink for his people, We said, strike the rock with thy rod; and there gushed thereout twelve fountains according to the number of the tribes, and all men knew their respective drinking-place. Eat and drink of the bounty of God, and commit not evil in the earth, acting unjustly
2|61|And when ye said, O Moses, we will by no means be satisfied with one kind of food; pray unto thy Lord therefore for us, that He would produce for us of that which the earth bringeth forth, herbs, and cucumbers, and garlick, and lentils, and onions; Moses answered, will ye exchange that which is better, for that which is worse? Get ye down in Egypt, for there shall ye find what ye desire: And they were smitten with vileness and misery, and drew on themselves indignation from God. This they suffered, because they believed not in the signs of God, and killed the prophets unjustly; this, because they rebelled and transgressed
2|62|Surely those who believe, and those who Judaize, and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believeth in God, and the last day, and doth that which is right, they shall have their reward with their Lord, there shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
2|63|Call to mind also when we accepted your covenant, and lifted up the mountain of Sinai over you, saying, receive the law which we have given you, with a resolution to keep it, and remember that which is contained therein, that ye may beware
2|64|After this ye again turned back, so that if it had not been for God's indulgence and mercy towards you, ye had certainly been destroyed
2|65|Moreover ye know what befall those of your nation who transgressed on the sabbath day; we said unto them, be ye changed into apes, driven away from the society of men
2|66|And we made them an example unto those who were contemporary with them, and unto those who came after them, and a warning to the pious
2|67|And when Moses said unto his people, verily God commandeth you to sacrifice a cow; they answered, dost thou make a jest of us? Moses said, God fobid that I should be one of the foolish
2|68|They said, pray for us unto thy Lord, that He would shew us what cow it is. Moses answered, he saith, she is neither an old cow, nor a young heifer, but of a middle age between both: Do ye therefore that which ye are commanded
2|69|They said, pray for us unto thy Lord that he would shew us what colour she is of. Moses answered, he saith, she is a red cow, intensely red, her colour rejoiceth the beholders
2|70|They said, pray for us unto thy Lord, that He would further shew us what cow it is, for several cows with us are like one another, and we, if God please, will be directed
2|71|Moses answered, he saith, she is a cow not broken to plough the earth, or water the field, a found one, there is no blemish in her. They said, now hast thou brought the truth. Then they sacrificed her; yet they wanted but little of leaving it undone
2|72|And when ye slew a man, and contended among your selves concerning him, God brought forth to light that which ye concealed
2|73|For we said, strike the dead body with part of the sacrificed cow: So God raiseth the dead to life, and sheweth you his signs, that peradventure ye may understand
2|74|Then were your hearts hardened after this, even as stones, or exceeding them in hardness: For from some stones have rivers bursted forth, others have been rent in sunder, and water hath issued from them, and others have fallen down for fear of God. But God is not regardless of that which ye do
2|75|Do ye therefore desire that the Jews should believe you? Yet a part of them heard the word of God, and then perverted it, after they had understood it, against their own conscience
2|76|And when they meet the true believers, they say, we believe: But when they are privately assembled together, they say, will ye acquaint them with what God hath revealed unto you, that they may dispute with you concerning it in the presence of your Lord? Do ye not therefore understand
2|77|Do not they know that God knoweth that which they conceal as well as that which they publish
2|78|But there are illiterate men among them, who know not the book of the law, but only lying stories, although they think otherwise
2|79|And woe unto them who transcribe corruptly the book of the law with their hands, and then say, this is from God: That they may sell it for a small price. Therefore woe unto them because of that which their hands have written; and woe unto them for that which they have gained
2|80|They say, the fire of hell shall not touch us but for a certain number of days. Answer, have ye received any promise from God to that purpose? For God will not act contrary to his promise: Or do ye speak concerning God that which ye know not
2|81|Verily who so doth evil, and is encompassed by his iniquity, they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall remain therein for ever
2|82|But they who believe and do good works, they shall be the companions of paradise, they shall continue therein for ever
2|83|Remember also, when We accepted the covenant of the children of Israel, saying, ye shall not worship any other except God, and ye shall shew kindness to your parents and kindred, and to orphans, and to the poor, and speak that which is good unto men; and be constant at prayer, and give alms. Afterwards ye turned back, except a few of you, and retired afar off
2|84|And when We accepted your covenant, saying, ye shall not shed your brothers blood, nor dispossess one another of your habitations. Then ye confirmed it, and were witnesses thereto
2|85|Afterwards ye were they who slew one another, and turned several of your brethren out of their houses, mutually assisting each other against them with injustice and enmity; but if they come captives unto you, ye redeem them: Yet it is equally unlawful for you to dispossess them. Do ye therefore believe in part of the book of the law, and reject other part thereof? But whoso among you doth this, shall have no other reward than shame in this life, and on the day of resurrection they shall be sent to a most grievous punishment; for God is not regardless of that which ye do
2|86|These are they who have purchased this present life, at the price of that which is to come; wherefore their punishment shall not be mitigated, neither shall they be helped
2|87|We formerly delivered the book of the law unto Moses, and caused Apostles to succeed him, and gave evident miracles to Jesus the son of Mary, and strengthened him with the holy spirit. Do ye therefore, whenever an Apostle cometh unto you with that which your souls desire not, proudly reject him, and accuse some of imposture, and slay others
2|88|The Jews say, our hearts are uncircumcised: But God hath cursed them with their infidelity, therefore few shall believe
2|89|And when a book came unto them from God, confirming the scriptures which were with them, although they had before prayed for assistance against those who believed not, yet when that came unto them which they knew to be from God, they would not believe therein: therefore the curse of God shall be on the infidels
2|90|For a vile price have they sold their souls, that they should not believe in that which God hath sent down; out of envy, because God sendeth down his favours to such of his servants as he pleaseth: Therefore they brought on themselves indignation on indignation; and the unbelievers shall suffer an ignominious punishment
2|91|When one saith unto them, believe in that which God hath sent down; they answer, we believe in that which hath been sent down unto us: And they reject what hath been revealed since, although it be the truth, confirming that which is with them. Say, why therefore have ye slain the prophets of God in times past, if ye be true believers
2|92|Moses formerly came unto you with evident signs, but ye afterwards took the calf for your god and did wickedly
2|93|And when we accepted your covenant and lifted the mountain of Sinai over you, saying, receive the law which we have given you, with a resolution to perform it, and hear; they said, we have heard, and have rebelled: And they were made to drink down the calf into their hearts for their unbelief. Say, a grievous thing hath your faith commanded you, if ye be true believers
2|94|Say, if the future mansion with God be prepared peculiarly for you, exclusive of the rest of mankind, wish for death, if ye say truth
2|95|But they will never wish for it, because of that which their hands have sent before them; God knoweth the wicked doers
2|96|and thou shalt surely find them of all men the most covetous of life, even more than the idolaters: One of them would desire his life to be prolonged a thousand years, but none shall reprieve himself from punishment, that his life may be prolonged: God seeth that which they do
2|97|Say, whoever is an enemy to Gabriel -- for he hath caused the Koran to descend on thy heart, by the permission of God, confirming that which was before revealed, a direction, and good tidings to the faithful
2|98|whosoever is an enemy to God, or his angels, or his Apostles, or to Gabriel, or Michael, verily God is an enemy to the unbelievers
2|99|And now we have sent down unto thee evident signs, and none will disbelieve them but the evil-doers
2|100|Whenever they make a covenant, will some of them reject it? Yea the greater part of them do not believe
2|101|And when there came unto them an Apostle from God, confirming that scripture which was with them, some of those to whom the scriptures were given, cast the book of God behind their backs, as if they knew it not
2|102|And they followed the device which the devils devised against the kingdom of Solomon; and Solomon was not an unbeliever; but the devils believed not, they taught men sorcery, and that which was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut: Yet those two taught no man until they had said, verily we are a temptation, therefore be not an unbeliever. So men learned from those two a charm by which they might cause division between a man and his wife; but they hurt none thereby, unless by God's permission; and they learned that which would hurt them, and not profit them; and yet they knew that he who bought that art should have no part in the life to come, and woful is the price for which they have sold their souls, if they knew it
2|103|But if they had believed, and feared God, verily the reward they would have had from God, would have been better, if they had known it
2|104|O true believers, say not to our Apostle, Raina; but say Ondhorna; and hearken: The infidels shall suffer a grievous punishment
2|105|It is not the desire of the unbelievers, either among those unto whom the scriptures have been given, or among the idolaters, that any good should be sent down unto you from your Lord: But God will appropriate his mercy unto whom he pleaseth; for God is exceeding beneficent
2|106|Whatever verse we shall abrogate, or cause thee to forget, we will bring a better than it, or one like unto it. Dost thou not know that God is almighty
2|107|Dost thou not know that unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth? Neither have ye any protector or helper except God
2|108|Will ye require of your Apostle according to that which was formerly required of Moses? But he that hath exchanged faith for infidelity, hath already erred from the strait way
2|109|Many of those unto whom the scriptures have been given, desire to render you again unbelievers, after ye have believed; out of envy from their souls, even after the truth is become manifest unto them; but forgive them, and avoid them, till God shall send his command; for God is omnipotent
2|110|Be constant in prayer, and give alms; and what good ye have sent before for your souls, ye shall find it with God; surely God seeth that which ye do
2|111|They say, verily none shall enter paradise, except they who are Jews or Christians: This is their wish. Say, produce your proof of this, if ye speak truth
2|112|Nay, but he who resigneth himself to God, and doth that which is right, he shall have his reward with his Lord; there shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
2|113|The Jews say, the Christians are grounded on nothing; and the Christians say, the Jews are grounded on nothing: Yet they both read the scriptures. So likewise say they who know not the scripture, according to their saying. But God shall judge between them on the day of the resurrection, concerning that about which they now disagree
2|114|Who is more unjust than he who prohibiteth the temples of God, that his name should be remembered therin, and who hasteth to destroy them? Those men cannot enter therein, but with fear: They shall have shame in this world, and in the next a grievous punishment
2|115|To God belongeth the east and the west; therefore whithersoever ye turn your selves to pray, there is the face of God; for God is omnipresent and omniscient
2|116|They say, God hath begotten children: God forbid! To him belongeth whatever is in heaven, and on earth; all is possessed by him
2|117|the creator of heaven and earth; and when he decreeth a thing, he only saith unto it, be, and it is
2|118|And they who know not the scriptures say, unless God speak unto us, or thou shew us a sign, we will not believe. So said those before them, according to their saying: Their hearts resemble each other. We have already shewn manifest signs unto people who firmly believe
2|119|we have sent thee in truth, a bearer of good tidings, and a preacher; and thou shalt not be questioned concerning the companions of hell
2|120|But the Jews will not be pleased with thee, neither the Christians, until thou follow their religion; say, the direction of God is the true direction. And verily if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, thou shalt find no patron or protector against God
2|121|They to whom we have given the book of the Koran, and who read it with its true reading, they believe therein; and whoever believeth not therein, they shall perish
2|122|O children of Israel, remember my favour wherewith I have favoured you, and that I have preferred you before all nations
2|123|and dread the day wherein one soul shall not make satisfaction for another soul, neither shall any compensation be accepted from them, nor shall any intercession avail, neither shall they be helped
2|124|Remember when the Lord tried Abraham by certain words, which he fulfilled: God said, verily I will constitute thee a model of religion unto mankind; he answered, and also of my posterity; God said, my covenant doth not comprehend the ungodly
2|125|And when we appointed the holy house of Mecca to be a place of resort for mankind, and a place of security; and said, take the station of Abraham for a place of prayer; and we covenanted with Abraham and Ismael, that they should cleanse my house for those who should compass it, and those who should be devoutly assiduous there, and those who should bow down and worship
2|126|And when Abraham said, Lord, make this a territory of security, and bounteously bestow fruits on its inhabitants, such of them as believe in God and the last day; God answered, and whoever believeth not, I will bestow on him little, afterwards I will drive him to the punishment of hellfire; an ill journey shall it be
2|127|And when Abraham and Ismael raised the foundations of the house, saying, Lord, accept it from us, for thou art he who heareth and knoweth
2|128|Lord, make us also resigned unto thee, and of our posterity a people resigned unto thee, and shew us our holy ceremonies, and be turned unto us, for thou art easy to be reconciled, and merciful
2|129|Lord, send them likewise an Apostle from among them, who may declare thy signs unto them, and teach them the book of the Koran and wisdom, and may purify them; for thou art mighty and wise
2|130|Who will be averse to the religion of Abraham, but he whose mind is infatuated? Surely we have chosen him in this world, and in that which is to come he shall be one of the righteous
2|131|When his Lord said unto him, resign thy self unto me; he answered, I have resigned my self unto the Lord of all creatures
2|132|And Abraham bequeathed this religion to his children, and Jacob did the same, saying, my children, verily God hath chosen this religion for you, therefore die not, unless ye also be resigned
2|133|Were ye present when Jacob was at the point of death? When he said to his sons, whom will ye worship after me? They answered, we will worship thy God, and the God of thy fathers Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, one God, and to him will we be resigned
2|134|That people are now passed away, they have what they have gained, and ye shall have what ye gain; and ye shall not be questioned concerning that which they have done
2|135|They say, become Jews or Christians that ye may be directed. Say, nay, we follow the religion of Abraham the orthodox, who was no idolater
2|136|Say, we believe in God, and that which hath been sent down unto us, and that which hath been sent down unto Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which was delivered unto Moses, and Jesus, and that which was delivered unto the prophets from their Lord: We make no distinction between any of them, and to God are we resigned
2|137|Now if they believe according to what ye believe, they are surely directed, but if they turn back, they are in schism. God shall support thee against them, for he is the hearer, the wise
2|138|The baptism of God have we received, and who it better than God to baptize? Him do we worship
2|139|Say, will ye dispute with us concernig God, who is our Lord, and your Lord? We have our works, and ye have your works, and unto him are we sincerely devoted
2|140|Will ye say, truly Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, are ye wiser, or God? And who is more unjust than he who hideth the testimony which he hath received from God? But God is not regardless of that which ye do
2|141|That people are passed away, they have what they have gained, and ye shall have what ye gain, nor shall ye be questioned concerning that which they have done
2|142|The foolish men will say, what hath turned them from their Keblah, towards which they formerly prayed? Say, unto God belongeth the east and the west: He directeth whom he pleaseth into the right way
2|143|Thus have we placed you, O Arabians, an intermediate nation, that ye may be witnesses against the rest of mankind, and that the Apostle may be a witness against you. We appointed the Keblah towards which thou didst formerly pray, only that we might know him who followeth the Apostle, from him who turneth back on his heel; though this change seem a great matter, unless unto those whom God hath directed. But God will not render your faith of none effect; for God is gracious and merciful unto man
2|144|We have seen thee turn about thy face towards heaven with uncertainty, but we will cause thee to turn thy self towards a Keblah that will please thee. Turn therefore thy face towards the holy temple of Mecca; and wherever ye be, turn your faces towards that place. They to whom the scripture hath been given, know this to be truth from their Lord. God is not regardless of that which ye do
2|145|Verily although thou shouldest shew unto those to whom the scripture hath been given, all kinds of signs, yet they will not follow thy Keblah, neither shalt thou follow their Keblah; nor will one part of them follow the Keblah of the other. And if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, verily thou wilt become one of the ungodly
2|146|They to whom we have given the scripture know our apostle, even as they know their own children; but some of them hide the truth, against their own knowledge
2|147|Truth is from thy Lord, therefore thou shalt not doubt
2|148|Every sect hath a certain tract of heaven to which they turn themselves in prayer; but for ye strive to run after good things: Wherever ye be, God will bring you all back at the resurrection, for God is almighty
2|149|And from what place soever thou comest forth, turn thy face towards the holy temple; for this is truth from thy Lord; neither is God regardless of that which ye do
2|150|From what place soever thou comest forth, turn thy face towards the holy temple; and wherever ye be, thitherward turn your faces, lest men have matter of dispute against you; but as for those among them who are unjust doers, fear them not, but fear me, that I may accomplish my grace upon you, and that ye may be directed
2|151|As we have sent unto you an apostle from among you, to rehearse our signs unto you, and to purify you, and to teach you the book of the Koran and wisdom, and to teach you that which ye knew not
2|152|Therefore remember me, and I will remember you, and give thanks unto me, and be not unbelievers
2|153|O true believers, beg assistance with patience and prayer, for God is with the patient
2|154|And say not of those who are slain in fight for the religion of God, that they are dead; yea, they are living: But ye do not understand
2|155|We will surely prove you by afflicting you in some measure with fear, and hunger, and decrease of wealth, and loss of lives, and scarcity of fruits: But bear good tidings unto the patient
2|156|who when a misfortune befalleth them, say, we are God's, and unto him shall we surely return
2|157|Upon them shall be blessings from their Lord and mercy, and they are the rightly directed
2|158|Moreover Safa and Merwah are two of the monuments of God: Whoever therefore goeth on pilgrimage to the temple of Mecca or visiteth it, it shall be no crime in him if he compass them both. And as for him who voluntarily performeth a good work; verily God is grateful and knowing
2|159|They who conceal any of the evident signs, or the direction which we have sent down, after what we have manifested unto men in the scripture, God shall curse them; and they who curse shall curse them
2|160|But as for those who repent and amend, and make known what they concealed, I will be turned unto them, for I am easy to be reconciled and merciful
2|161|Surely they who believe not, and die in their unbelief, upon them shall be the curse of God, and of the angels, and of all men
2|162|they shall remain under it for ever, their punishment shall not be alleviated, neither shall they be regarded
2|163|Your God is one God, there is no God but He, the most merciful
2|164|Now in the creation of heaven and earth, and the vicissitude of night and day, and in the ship which saileth in the sea, loaden with what is profitable for mankind, and in the rain water which God sendeth from heaven, quickening thereby the dead earth, and replenishing the same with all sorts of cattle, and in the change of winds, and the clouds that are compelled to do service between heaven and earth, are signs to people of understanding
2|165|Yet some men take idols beside God, and love them as with the love due to God; but the true believers are more fervent in love towards God. Oh that they who act unjustly did perceive, when they behold their punishment, that all power belongeth unto God, and that he is severe in punishing
2|166|When those who have been followed, shall separate themselves from their followers, and shall see the punishment, and the cords of relation between them shall be cut in sunder
2|167|the followers shall say, if we could return to life, we would separate our selves from them, as they have now separated themselves from us. So God will shew them their works; they shall sigh grievously and shall not come forth from the fire of hell
2|168|O men, eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth; and tread not in the steps of the devil, for he is your open enemy
2|169|Verily he commandeth you evil and wickedness, and that ye should say that of God which ye know not
2|170|And when it is said unto them who believe not, follow that which God hath sent down; they answer, nay, but we will follow that which we found our fathers practise. What? Though their fathers knew nothing, and were not rightly directed
2|171|The unbelievers are like unto one who crieth aloud to that which heareth not so much as his calling, or the sound of his voice. They are deaf, dumb, and blind, therefore do they not understand
2|172|O true believers, eat of the good things which we have bestowed on you for food, and return thanks unto God, if ye serve him
2|173|Verily he hath forbidden you to eat that which dieth of itself, and blood, and swine's flesh, and that on which any other name but God's hath been invocated. But he who is forced by necessity, not lusting, nor returning to transgress, it shall be no crime in him if he eat of those things, for God is gracious and merciful
2|174|Moreover they who conceal any part of the scripture which God hath sent down unto them, and sell it for a small price, they shall swallow into their bellies nothing but fire; God shall not speak unto them on the day of resurrection, neither shall he purify them, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment
2|175|These are they who have sold direction for error, and pardon for punishment: But how great will their suffering be in the fire
2|176|This they shall endure, because God sent down the book of the Koran with truth, and they who disagree concerning that book, are certainly in a wide mistake
2|177|It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces in prayer towards the east and the west, but righteousness is of him who believeth in God and the last day, and the angels, and the scriptures, and the prophets; who giveth money for God's sake unto his kindred, and unto orphans, and the needy, and the stranger, and those who ask, and for redemption of captives; who is constant at prayer, and giveth alms; and of those who perform their covenant, when they have covenanted, and who behave themselves patiently in adversity, and hardships, and in time of violence: These are they who are true, and these are they who fear God
2|178|O true believers, the law of retaliation is ordained you for the slain: The free shall die for the free, and the servant for the servant, and a woman for a woman: But he whom his brother shall forgive, may be prosecuted, and obliged to make satisfaction according to what is just, and a fine shall be set on him with humanity. This is indulgence from your Lord, and mercy. And he who shall transgress after this, by killing the murderer, shall suffer a grievous punishment
2|179|And in this law of retaliation ye have life, O ye of understanding, that peradventure ye may fear
2|180|It is ordained you, when any of you is at the point of death, if he leave any goods, that he bequeath a legacy to his parents, and kindred, according to what shall be reasonable. This is a duty incumbent on those who fear God
2|181|But he who shall change the legacy, after he hath heard it bequeathed by the dying person, surely the sin thereof shall be on those who change it, for God is he who heareth and knoweth
2|182|Howbeit he who apprehendeth from the testator any mistake or injustice, and shall compose the matter between them, that shall be no crime in him, for God is gracious and merciful
2|183|O true believers, a fast is ordained you, as it was ordained unto those before you, that ye may fear God
2|184|A certain number of days shall ye fast: But he among you who shall be sick, or on a journey, shall fast an equal number of other days. And those who can keep it, and do not, must redeem their neglect by maintaining of a poor man. And he who voluntarily dealeth better with the poor man than he is obliged, this shall be better for him. But if ye fast it will be better for you, if ye knew it
2|185|The month of Ramadan shall ye fast, in which the Koran was sent down from heaven, a direction unto men, and declarations of direction, and the distinction between good and evil. Therefore let him among you who shall be present in this month, fast the same month; but he who shall be sick, or on a journey, shall fast the like number of other days. God would make this an ease unto you, and would not make it a difficulty unto you; that ye may fulfill the number of days, and glorify God, for that he hath directed you, and that ye may give thanks
2|186|When my servants ask thee concerning me, verily I am near; I will hear the prayer of him that prayeth, when he prayeth unto me: But let them hearken unto me, and believe in me, that they may be rightly directed
2|187|It is lawful for you on the night of the fast to go in unto your wives; they are a garment unto you, and ye are a garment unto them. God knoweth that ye defraud your selves therein, wherefore he turneth unto you, and forgiveth you. Now therefore go in unto them; and earnestly desire that which God ordaineth you, and eat and drink until ye can plainly distinguish a white thread from a black thread by the day-break: Then keep the fast until night, and go not in unto them, but be constantly present in the places of worship. These are the prescribed bounds of God, therefore draw not near them to transgress them. Thus God declareth his signs unto men, that they may fear him
2|188|Consume not your wealth among your selves in vain; nor present it unto judges, that ye may devour part of men's substance unjustly, against your own consciences
2|189|They will ask thee concerning the phases of the moon: Answer, they are times appointed unto men, and to shew the season of the pilgrimage to Mecca. It is not righteousness that ye enter your houses by the back parts thereof, but righteousness is of him who feareth God. Therefore enter your houses by their doors; and fear God, that ye may be happy
2|190|And fight for the religion of God against those who fight against you, but transgress not by attacking them first, for God loveth not the transgressors
2|191|And kill them wherever ye find them, and turn them out of that whereof they have dispossessed you, for temptation to idolatry is more grievous than slaughter: Yet fight not against them in the holy temple, until they attack you therein; but if they attack you, slay them there. This shall be the reward of the infidels
2|192|But if they desist, God is gracious and merciful
2|193|Fight therefore against them, until there be no temptation to idolatry, and the religion be God's: But if they desist, then let there be no hostility, except against the ungodly
2|194|A sacred month for a sacred month, and the holy limits of Mecca, if they attack you therein, do ye also attack them therein in retaliation; and whoever transgresseth against you by so doing, do ye transgress against him in like manner as he hath transgressed against you, and fear God, and know that God is with those who fear him
2|195|Contribute out of your substance toward the defence of the religion of God, and throw not your selves with your own hands into perdition; and do good, for God loveth those who do good
2|196|Perform the pilgrimage of Mecca, and the visitation of God: And if ye be besieged, send that offering which shall be the easiest; and shave not your heads, until your offering reacheth the place of sacrifice. But whoever among you is sick, or is troubled with any distemper of the head, must redeem the shaving his head by fasting, or alms, or some offering. When ye are secure from enemies, he who tarrieth in the visitation of the temple of Mecca until the pilgrimage, shall bring that offering which shall be the easiest. But he who findeth not any thing to offer, shall fast three days in the pilgrimage, and seven when ye are returned: They shall be ten days complete. This is incumbent on him, whose family shall not be present at the holy temple. And fear God and know that God is severe in punishing
2|197|The pilgrimage must be performed in the known months; whosoever therefore purposeth to go on pilgrimage therein, let him not know a woman, nor transgress, nor quarrel in the pilgrimage. The good which ye do, God knoweth it. Make provision for your journey; but the best provision is piety: And fear me, O ye of understanding
2|198|It shall be no crime in you, if ye seek an increase from your Lord, by trading during the pilgrimage. And when ye go in procession from Arafat, remember God near the holy monument; and remember him for that he hath directed you, although ye were before this of the number of those who go astray
2|199|Therefore go in procession from whence the people go in procession, and ask pardon of God, for God is gracious and merciful
2|200|And when ye have finished your holy ceremonies, remember God, according as ye remember your fathers, or with a more reverend commemoration. There are some men who say, O Lord, give us our portion in this world; but such shall have no portion in the next life
2|201|And there are others who say, O Lord, give us good in this world, and also good in the next world, and deliver us from the torment of hell fire
2|202|They shall have a portion of that which they have gained: God is swift in taking an account
2|203|Remember God the appointed number of days: But if any haste to depart from the valley of Mina in two days, it shall be no crime in him. And if any tarry longer, it shall be no crime in him, in him who feareth God. Therefore fear God, and know that unto him ye shall be gathered
2|204|There is a man who causeth thee to marvel by his speech concerning this present life, and calleth God to witness that which is in his heart, yet he is most intent in opposing thee
2|205|and when he turneth away from thee, he hasteth to act corruptly in the earth, and to destroy that which is sown, and springeth up: But God loveth not corrupt doing
2|206|And if one say unto him, fear God; pride seizeth him, together with wickedness; but hell shall be his reward, and an unhappy couch shall it be
2|207|There is also a man who selleth his soul for the sake of those things which are pleasing unto God; and God is gracious unto his servants
2|208|O true believers, enter into the true religion wholly, and follow not the steps of Satan, for he is your open enemy
2|209|If ye have slipped after the declarations of our will have come unto you, know that God is mighty and wise
2|210|Do the infidels expect less than that God should come down to them overshadowed with clouds, and the angels also? But the thing is decreed, and to God shall all things return
2|211|Ask the children of Israel how many evident signs we have shewed them; and whoever shall change the grace of God, after it shall have come unto him, verily God will be severe in punishing him
2|212|The present life was ordained for those who believe not, and they laugh the faithful to scorn; but they who fear God shall be above them, on the day of the resurrection: For God is bountiful unto whom he pleaseth without measure
2|213|Mankind was of one faith, and God sent prophets bearing good tidings, and denouncing threats, and sent down with them the scripture in truth, that it might judge between men of that concerning which they disagreed: And none disagreed concerning it, except those to whom the same scriptures were delivered, after the declarations of God's will had come unto them, out of envy among themselves. And God directed those who believed, to that truth concerning which they disagreed, by his will: For God directeth whom he pleaseth into the right way
2|214|Did ye think ye should enter paradise, when as yet no such thing had happened unto you, as hath happened unto those who have been before you? They suffered calamity, and tribulation, and were afflicted; so that the apostle, and they who believed with him, said; when will the help of God come? Is not the help of God nigh
2|215|They will ask thee what they shall bestow in alms: Answer, the good which ye bestow, let it be given to parents, and kindred, and orphans, and the poor, and the stranger. Whatsoever good ye do, God knoweth it
2|216|War is enjoined you against the infidels; but this is hateful unto you: Yet perchance ye hate a thing which is better for you, and perchance ye love a thing which is worse for you: But God knoweth and ye know not
2|217|They will ask thee concerning the sacred month, whether they may war therein: Answer, to war therein is grievous; but to obstruct the way of God, and infidelity towards him, and to keep men from the holy temple, and to drive out his people from thence, is more grievous in the sight of God, and the temptation to idolatry is more grievous than to kill in the sacred months. They will not cease to war against you, until they turn you from your religion, if they be able: But whoever among you shall turn back from his religion, and die an infidel, their works shall be vain in this world, and the next; they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall remain therein for ever
2|218|But they who believe, and who fly for the sake of religion, and fight in God's cause, they shall hope for the mercy of God; for God is gracious and merciful
2|219|They will ask thee concerning wine and lots: Answer, in both there is great sin, and also some things of use unto men; but their sinfulness is greater than their use. They will ask thee also what they shall bestow in alms: Answer, what ye have to spare. Thus God sheweth his signs unto you, that peradventure ye might seriously think
2|220|of this present world, and of the next. They will also ask thee concerning orphans: Answer, to deal righteously with them is best and if ye intermeddle with the management of what belongs to them, do them no wrong; they are your brethren: God knoweth the corrupt dealer from the righteous; and if God please, he will surely distress you, for God is mighty and wise
2|221|Marry not women who are idolaters, until they believe: Verily a maid servant who believeth, is better than an idolatress, although she please you more. And give not women who believe, in marriage to the idolaters, until they believe; for verily a servant, who is a true believer, is better than an idolater, though he please you more. They invite unto hell fire, but God inviteth unto paradise and pardon through his will, and declareth his signs unto men, that they may remember
2|222|They will ask thee also, concerning the courses of women: Answer, they are a pollution: Therefore separate your selves from women in their courses, and go not near them, until they be cleansed. But when they are cleansed, go in unto them as God hath commanded you, for God loveth those who repent, and loveth those who are clean
2|223|Your wives are your tillage; go in therefore unto your tillage in what manner soever ye will: And do first some act that may be profitable unto your souls; and fear God, and know that ye must meet him; and bear good tidings unto the faithful
2|224|Make not God the object of your oaths, that ye will deal justly, and be devout, and make peace among men; for God is he who heareth and knoweth
2|225|God will not punish you for an inconsiderate word in your oaths; but he will punish you for that which your hearts have assented unto: God is merciful and gracious
2|226|They who vow to abstain from their wives, are allowed to wait four months: But if they go back from their vow, verily God is gracious and merciful
2|227|and if they resolve on a divorce, God is he who heareth and knoweth
2|228|The women who are divorced shall wait concerning themselves until they have their courses thrice, and it shall not be lawful for them to conceal that which God hath created in their wombs, if they believe in God and the last day; and their husbands will act more justly to bring them back at this time, if they desire a reconciliation. The women ought also to behave towards their husbands in like manner as their husbands should behave towards them, according to what is just: But the men ought to have a superiority over them. God is mighty and wise
2|229|Ye may divorce your wives twice; and then either retain them with humanity, or dismiss them with kindness. But it is not lawful for you to take away any thing of what ye have given them, unless both fear that they cannot observe the ordinances of God. And if ye fear that they cannot observe the ordinances of God, it shall be no crime in either of them of account of that for which the wife shall redeem her self. These are the ordinances of God; therefore transgress them not; for whoever transgresseth the ordinances of God, they are unjust doers
2|230|But if the husband divorce her a third time, she shall not be lawful for him again, until she marry another husband. But if he also divorce her, it shall be no crime in them, if they return to each other, if they think they can observe the ordinances of God; and these are the ordinances of God, he declareth them to people of understanding
2|231|But when ye divorce women, and they have fulfilled their prescribed time, either retain them with humanity, or dismiss them with kindness; and retain them not by violence, so that ye transgress; for he who doth this, surely injureth his own soul. And make not the signs of God a jest: But remember God's favour towards you, and that he hath sent down unto you the book of the Koran, and wisdom, admonishing you thereby; and fear God, and know that God is omniscient
2|232|But when ye have divorced your wives, and they have fulfilled their prescribed time, hinder them not from marrying their husbands, when they have agreed among themselves according to what is honourable. This is given in admonition unto him among you who believeth in God, and the last day. This is most righteous for you, and most pure. God knoweth, but ye know not
2|233|Mothers after they are divorced shall give suck unto their children two full years, to him who desireth the time of giving suck to be completed; and the father shall be obliged to maintain them and cloath them in the mean time, according to that which shall be reasonable. No person shall be obliged beyond his ability. A mother shall not be compelled to what is unreasonable on account of her child, nor a father on account of his child. And the heir of the father shall be obliged to do in like manner. But if they choose to wean the child before the end of two years, by common consent, and on mutual consideration, it shall be no crime in them. And if ye have a mind to provide a nurse for your children, it shall be no crime in you, in case ye fully pay what ye offer her, according to that which is just. And fear God, and know that God seeth whatsoever ye do
2|234|Such of you as die, and leave wives, their wives must wait concerning themselves four months and ten days, and when they shall have fulfilled their term, it shall be no crime in you, for that which they shall do with themselves, according to what is reasonable. God well knoweth that which ye do
2|235|And it shall be no crime in you, whether ye make public overtures of marriage unto such women, within the said four months and ten days, or whether ye conceal such your designs in your minds: God knoweth that ye will remember them. But make no promise unto them privately, unless ye speak honourable words; and resolve not on the knot of marriage, until the prescribed time be accomplished; and know that God knoweth that which is in your minds, therefore beware of him, and know that God is gracious and merciful
2|236|It shall be no crime in you, if ye divorce your wives, so long as ye have not touched them, nor settled any dowry on them. And provide for them -- he who is at his ease must provide according to his circumstances, and he who is straitened according to his circumstances -- necessaries, according to what shall be reasonable. This is a duty incumbent on the righteous
2|237|But if ye divorce them before ye have touched them, and have already settled a dowry on them, ye shall give them half of what ye have settled, unless they release any part, or he release part in whose hand the knot of marriage is; and if ye release the whole, it will approach nearer unto piety. And forget not liberality among you, for God seeth that which ye do
2|238|Carefully observe the appointed prayers, and the middle prayer, and be assiduous therein, with devotion towards God
2|239|But if ye fear any danger, pray on foot or on horseback; and when ye are safe, remember God, how he hath taught you what as yet ye knew not
2|240|And such of you as shall die and leave wives, ought to bequeath their wives a year's maintenance, without putting them out of their houses: But if they go out voluntarily, it shall be no crime in you, for that which they shall do with themselves, according to what shall be reasonable; God is mighty and wise
2|241|And unto those who are divorced, a reasonable provision is also due; this is a duty incumbent on those who fear God
2|242|Thus God declareth his signs unto you, that ye may understand
2|243|Hast thou not considered those, who left their habitations, -- and they were thousands -- for fear of death? And God said unto them, die; then he restored them to life, for God is gracious towards mankind; but the greater part of men do not give thanks
2|244|Fight for the religion of God, and know that God is he who heareth and knoweth
2|245|Who is he that will lend unto God on good usury? Verily he will double it unto him manifold; for God contracteth and extendeth his hand as he pleaseth, and to him shall ye return
2|246|Hast thou not considered the assembly of the children of Israel, after the time of Moses; when they said unto their prophet Samual, set a king over us, that we may fight for the religion of God? The prophet answered, if ye are enjoined to go to war, will ye be near refusing to fight? They answered, and what should ail us that we should not fight for the religion of God, seeing we are dispossessed of our habitations, and deprived of our children? But when they were enjoined to go to war, they turned back, except a few of them: And God knew the ungodly
2|247|And their prophet said unto them, verily God hath set Jalut, king over you: They answered, how shall he reign over us, seeing we are more worthy of the kingdom than he, neither is he possessed of great riches? Samual said, verily God hath chosen him before you, and hath caused him to increase in knowledge and stature, for God giveth his kingdom unto whom he pleaseth; God is bounteous and wise
2|248|And their prophet said unto them, verily the sign of his kingdom shall be, that the ark shall come unto you; Therein shall be tranquility from your Lord, and the relics which have been left by the family of Moses, and the family of Aaron; the angels shall bring it. Verily this shall be a sign unto you, if ye believe
2|249|And when Jalut departed with his soldiers, he said, verily God will prove you by the river: For he who drinketh thereof, shall not be on my side -- but he who shall not taste thereof he shall be on my side -- except he who drinketh a draught out of his hand. And they drank thereof, except a few of them. And when they had passed the river, he and those who believed with him, they said, we have no strength to day, against Jalut and his forces. But they who considered that they should meet God at the resurrection, said, how often hath a small army discomfited a great army, by the will of God? And God is with those who patiently persevere
2|250|And when they went forth to battle against Jalut and his forces, they said, O Lord, pour on us patience, and confirm our feet, and help us against the unbelieving people
2|251|Therefore they discomfited them, by the will of God, and David slew Jalut. And God gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him his will, and if God had not prevented men, the one by the other, verily the earth had been corrupted: But God is beneficent towards his creatures
2|252|These are the signs of God: We rehearse them unto thee with truth, and thou art surely one of those who have been sent by God
2|253|These are the apostles; we have preferred some of them before others: Some of them hath God spoken unto, and hath exalted the degree of others of them. And we gave unto Jesus the son of Mary manifest signs, and strengthened him with the holy spirit. And if God had pleased, they who came after those apostles, would not have contended among themselves, after manifest signs had been shewn unto them. But they fell to variance; therefore some of them believed, and some of them believed not; and if God had so pleased, they would not have contended among themselves, but God doth what he will
2|254|O true believers, give alms of that which we have bestowed on you, before the day cometh wherein there shall be no merchandizing, nor friendship, nor intercession. The infidels are unjust doers
2|255|God! There is no God but he; the living, the self-subsisting: Neither slumber nor sleep seizeth him; to him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven, and on earth. Who is he that can intercede with him, but through his good pleasure? He knoweth that which is past, and that which is to come unto them, and they shall not comprehend any thing of his knowledge, but so far as he pleaseth. His throne is extended over heaven and earth, and the preservation of both is no burden unto him. He is the high, the mighty
2|256|Let there be no violence in religion. Now is right direction manifestly distinguished from deceit: Whoever therefore shall deny Tagut(false gods), and believe in God, he shall surely take hold on a strong handle, which shall not be broken; God is he who heareth and seeth
2|257|God is the patron of those who believe; he shall lead them out of darkness into light: But as to those who believe not, their patrons are Tagut(false gods); they shall lead them from the light into darkness; they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall remain therein for ever
2|258|Hast thou not considered him who disputed with Abraham concerning his Lord, because God had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said, my Lord is he who giveth life, and killeth: He answered, I give life, and I kill. Abraham said, verily God bringeth the sun from the east, now do thou bring it from the west. Whereupon the infidel was confounded; for God directeth not the ungoldly people
2|259|Or hast thou not considered how he behaved who passed by a city which had been destroyed, even to her foundations? He said, how shall God quicken this city, after she hath been dead? And God caused him to die for an hundred years, and afterwards raised him to life. And God said, how long hast thou tarried here? He answered, a day, or part of a day. God said, nay, thou hast tarried here an hundred years. Now look on thy food and thy drink, they are not yet corrupted; and look on thine ass: And this have we done that we might make thee a sign unto men. And look on the bones of thine ass, how we raise them, and afterwards cloath them with flesh. And when this was shewn unto him, he said, I know that God is able to do all things
2|260|And when Abraham said, O Lord, shew me how thou wilt raise the dead; God said, dost thou not yet believe? He answered, yea; but I ask this that my heart may rest at ease. God said, take therefore four birds, and divide them; then lay a part of them on every mountain; then call them, and they shall come swiftly unto thee: And know that God is mighty and wise
2|261|The similitude of those who lay out their substance for advancing the religion of God, is as a grain of corn which produceth seven ears, and in every ear an hundred grains; for God giveth twofold unto whom he pleaseth: God is bounteous and wise
2|262|They who lay out their substance for the religion of God, and afterwards follow not what they have so laid out by reproaches or mischief, they shall have their reward with their Lord; upon them shall no fear come, neither shall they be grieved
2|263|A fait speech, and to forgive, is better than alms followed by mischief. God is rich and merciful
2|264|O true believers, make not your alms of none effect by reproaching, or mischief, as he who layeth out what he hath to appear unto men to give alms, and believeth not in God and the last day. The likeness of such a one, is as a flint covered with earth, on which a violent rain falleth, and leaveth it hard. They cannot prosper in any thing which they have gained, for God directeth not the unbelieving people
2|265|And the likeness of those who lay out their substance from a desire to please God, and for an establishment for their souls, is as a garden on a hill, on which a violent rain falleth, and it bringeth forth its fruits twofold; and if a violent rain falleth not on it, yet the dew falleth thereon: And God seeth that which ye do
2|266|Doth any of you desire to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, through which rivers flow, wherein he may have all kinds of fruits, and that he may attain to old age, and have a weak off-spring? Then a violent fiery wind shall strike it, so that it shall be burned. Thus God declareth his signs unto you, that ye may consider
2|267|O true believers bestow alms of the good things which ye have gained, and of that which we have produced for you out of the earth, and choose not the bad thereof, to give it in alms, such as ye would not accept your selves, otherwise than by connivance: And know that God is rich and worthy to be praised
2|268|The devil threateneth you with poverty, and commandeth you filthy covetousness, but God promiseth you pardon from himself and abundance: God bounteous and wise
2|269|He giveth wisdom unto whom he pleaseth, and he unto whom wisdom is given, hath received much good: But none will consider, except the wise of heart
2|270|And whatever alms ye shall give, or whatever vow ye shall vow, verily God knoweth it; but the ungodly shall have none to help them
2|271|If ye make your alms to appear, it is well; but if ye conceal them, and give them unto the poor, this will be better for you, and will atone for your sins: And God is well informed of that which ye do
2|272|The direction of them belongeth not unto thee; but God directeth whom he pleaseth. The good that ye shall give in alms shall redound unto your selves; and ye shall not give unless out of desire of seeing the face of God. And what good thing ye shall give in alms, it shall be repaid you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly
2|273|unto the poor who are wholly employed in fighting for the religion of God, and cannot go to and fro in the earth; whom the ignorant man thinketh rich, because of their modesty: Thou shalt know them by this mark, they ask not men with importunity; and what good ye shall give in alms, verily God knoweth it
2|274|They who distribute alms of their substance night and day, in private and in public, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall no fear come, neither shall they be grieved
2|275|They who devour usury shall not arise from the dead, but as he ariseth whom Satan hath infected by a touch: This shall happen to them because they say. Truly selling is but as usury: And yet God hath permitted selling and forbidden usury. He therefore who when there cometh unto him an admonition from his Lord, abstaineth from usury for the future, shall have what is past forgiven him, and his affair belongeth unto God. But whoever returneth to usury, they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall continue therein for ever
2|276|God shall take his blessing from usury, and shall increase alms: For God loveth no infidel, or ungodly person
2|277|But they who believe and do that which is right, and observe the stated times of prayer, and pay their legal alms, they shall have their reward with their Lord: There shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
2|278|O true believers, fear God, and remit that which remaineth of usury, if ye really believe
2|279|but if ye do it not, hearken unto war, which is declared against you from God and his apostle: Yet if ye repent, ye shall have the capital of your money. Deal not unjustly with others, and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly
2|280|If there be an debtor under a difficulty of paying his debt, let his creditor wait till it be easy for him to do it; but if ye remit it as alms, it will be better for you, if ye knew it
2|281|And fear the day wherein ye shall return unto God, then shall every soul be paid what it hath gained, and they shall not be treated unjustly
2|282|O true believers, when ye bind yourselves one to the other in a debt for a certain time, write it down; and let a writer write between you according to justice, and let not the writer refuse writing according to what God hath taught him; but let him write, and let him who oweth the debt dictate, and let him fear God his Lord, and not diminish ought thereof. But if he who oweth the debt be foolish, or weak, or be not able to dictate himself, let his agent dictate according to equity; and call to witness two witnesses of your neighbouring men; but if there be not two men, let there be a man and two women of those whom ye shall choose for witnesses: If one of those women should mistake, the other of them will cause her to recollect. And the witnesses shall not refuse, whensoever they shall be called. And disdain not to write it down, be it a large debt, or be it a small one, until its time of payment: This will be more just in the sight of God, and more right for bearing witness, and more easy, that ye may not doubt. But if it be a present bargain which ye transact between your selves, it shall be no crime in you, if ye write it not down. And take witnesses when ye sell one to the other, and let no harm be done to the writer, nor to the witness; which if ye do, it will surely be injustice in you: And fear God, and God will instruct you, for God knoweth all things
2|283|And if ye be on a journey, and find no writer, let pledges be taken: But if one of you trust the other, let him who is trusted return what he is trusted with, and fear God his Lord. And conceal not the testimony, for he who concealeth it, hath surely a wicked heart: God knoweth that which ye do
2|284|Whatever is in heaven, and on earth is God's: And whether ye manifest that which is in your minds, or conceal it, God will call you to account for it, and will forgive whom he pleaseth, and will punish whom he pleaseth; for God is almighty
2|285|The apostle believeth in that which hath been sent down unto him from his Lord, and the faithful also. Every one of them believeth in God, and his angels, and his scriptures, and his apostles: We make no distinction at all between his apostles. And they say, we have heard, and do obey: We implore thy mercy, O Lord, for unto thee must we return
2|286|God will not force any soul beyond its capacity: It shall have the good which it gaineth, and it shall suffer the evil which it gaineth. O Lord punisth us not, if we forget, or act sinfully: O Lord lay not on us a burden like that which thou hast laid on those who have been before us; neither make us, O Lord, to bear what we have not strength to bear, but be favourable unto us, and spare us, and be merciful unto us. Thou art our patron, help us therefore against the unbelieving nations
3|1|M
3|2|There is no God but God, the living, the self-subsisting
3|3|He hath sent down unto thee the book of the Koran with truth, confirming that which was revealed before it; for he had formerly sent down the law, and the gospel
3|4|a direction unto men; and he had also sent down the distinction between good and evil. Verily those who believe not the signs of God, shall suffer a grievous punishment; for God is mighty, able to revenge
3|5|Surely nothing is hidden from God, of that which is on earth, or in heaven
3|6|it is he who formeth you in the wombs, as he pleaseth; there is no God but he, the mighty, the wise
3|7|It is he who hath sent down unto thee the book, wherein are some verses clear to be understood, they are the foundation of the book; and others are parabolical. But they whose hearts are perverse will follow that which is parabolical therein, out of love of schism, and a desire of the interpretation thereof; yet none knoweth the interpretation thereof, except God. But they who are well grounded in knowledge say, we believe therein, the whole is from our Lord; and none will consider except the prudent
3|8|O Lord, cause not our hearts to swerve from truth, after thou hast directed us: And give us from thee mercy, for thou art he who giveth
3|9|O Lord, thou shalt surely gather mankind together, unto a day of resurrection: There is no doubt of it, for God will not be contrary to the promise
3|10|As for the infidels, their wealth shall not profit them any thing, nor their children, against God: They shall be the fewel of hell fire
3|11|According to the wont of the people of Pharaoh, and of those who went before them, they charged our signs with a lie; but God caught them in their wickedness, and God is severe in punishing
3|12|Say unto those who believe not, ye shall be overcome, and thrown together into hell ; an unhappy couch shall it be
3|13|Ye have already had a miracle shewn you in two armies which attacked each other: One army fought for God's true religion, but the other were infidels; they saw the faithful twice as many as themselves in their eye-sight; for God strengtheneth with his help whom he pleaseth. Surely herein was an example unto men of understanding
3|14|The love and eager desire of wives, and children, and sums heaped up of gold and silver, and excellent horses, and cattle, and land, is prepared for men: This is the provision of the present life; but unto God shall be the most excellent return
3|15|Say, shall I declare unto you better things than this? For those who are devout are prepared with their Lord, gardens through which rivers flow; therin shall they continue for ever : And they shall enjoy wives free from impurity, and the favour of God; for God regardeth his servants
3|16|who say, O Lord we do sincerely believe; forgive us therefore our sins, and deliver us from the pain of hell fire
3|17|The patient, and the lovers of truth, and the devout, and the almsgivers, and those who ask pardon early in the morning
3|18|God hath born witness that there is no God but he; and the angels, and those who are endowed with wisdom profess the same; who executeth righteousness; there is no God but he; the mighty, the wise
3|19|Verily the true religion in the sight of God, is Islam; and they who had received the scriptures dissented not therefrom, until after the knowledge of God's unity had come unto them, out of envy among themselves; but whosoever believeth not in the signs of God, verily God will be swift in bringing him to account
3|20|If they dispute with thee, say, I have resigned my self unto God, and he who followeth me doth the same: And say unto them who have received the scriptures, and to the ignorant, do ye profess the religion of Islam? Now if they embrace Islam, they are surely directed; but if they turn their backs, verily unto thee belongeth preaching only; for God regardeth his servants
3|21|And unto those who believe not in the signs of God, and slay the prophets without a cause, and put those men to death who teach justice; denounce unto them a painful punishment
3|22|These are they whose works perish in this world, and in that which is to come; and they shall have none to help them
3|23|Hast thou not observed those unto whom part of the scripture was given? They were called unto the book of God, that it might judge between them; then some of them turned their backs, and retired afar off
3|24|This they did because they said, the fire of hell shall by no means touch us, but for a certain number of days: And that which they had falsly devised, hath deceived them in their religion
3|25|How then will it be with them, when we shall gather them together at the day of judgment, of which there is no doubt; and every soul shall be paid that which it hath gained, neither shall they be treated unjustly
3|26|Say, O God, who possessest the kingdom; thou givest the kingdom unto whom thou wilt, and thou takest away the kingdom from whom thou wilt: Thou exaltest whom thou wilt, and thou humblest whom thou wilt: In thy had is good, for thou art almighty
3|27|Thou makest the night to succeed the day: Thou bringest forth the living out of the dead, and thou bringest forth the dead out of the living; and providest food for whom thou wilt without measure
3|28|Let not the faithful take the infidels for their protectors, rather than the faithful: He who doth this, shall not be protected of God at all; unless ye fear any danger from them: But God warneth you to beware of himself; for unto God must ye return
3|29|Say, whether ye conceal that which is in your breasts, or whether ye declare it, God knoweth it; for he knoweth whatever is in heaven, and whatever is on earth: God is almighty
3|30|On the last day every soul shall find the good which it hath wrought, present; and the evil which it hath wrought, it shall wish that between it self and that were a wide distance: But God warneth you to beware of himself; for God is gracious unto his servants
3|31|Say, if ye love God, follow me: Then God shall love you, and forgive you your sins; for God is gracious, and merciful
3|32|Say, obey God, and his apostle: But if ye go back, verily God loveth not the unbelievers
3|33|God hath surely chosen Adam, and Noah, and the family of Abraham, and the family of Imran above the rest of the world
3|34|a race descending the one from the other: God is he who heareth and knoweth
3|35|Remember when the wife of Imran said, Lord, verily I have vowed unto thee that which is in my womb, to be dedicated to thy service: Accept it therefore of me; for thou art he who heareth and knoweth
3|36|And when she was delivered of it, she said, Lord, verily I have brought forth a female, -- and God well knew what she had brought forth -- and a male is not as a female: I have called her Mary; and I commend her to thy protection, and also her issue, against Satan driven away with stones
3|37|Therefore the Lord accepted her with a gracious acceptance, and caused her to bear an excellent offspring. And Zacharias took care of the child; whenever Zacharias went into the chamber to her, he found provisions with her: And he said, O Mary, whence hadst thou this? She answered, this is from God: For God provideth for whom he pleaseth without measure
3|38|There Zacharias called on his Lord, and said, Lord, give me from thee a good offspring, for thou art the hearer of prayer
3|39|And the angels called to him, while he stood praying in the chamber, saying, verily God promiseth thee a son named John, who shall bear witness to the word which cometh from God; an honourable person, chast, and one of the righteous prophets
3|40|He answered, Lord, how shall I have a son, when old age hath overtaken me, and my wife is barren? The angel said, so God doth that which he pleaseth
3|41|Zacharias answered, Lord, give me a sign. The angel said, thy sign shall be, that thou shalt speak unto no man for three days, otherwise than by gesture: Remember thy Lord often, and praise him evening and morning
3|42|And when the angels said, O Mary, verily God hath chosen thee, and hath purified thee, and hath chosen thee above all the women of the world
3|43|O Mary, be devout towards thy Lord, and worship, and bow down with those who bow down
3|44|This is a secret history: We reveal it unto thee, although thou wast not present with them when they threw in their rods to cast lots which of them should have the education of Mary; neither wast thou with them, when they strove among themselves
3|45|When the angels said; O Mary, verily God sendeth thee good tidings, that thou shalt bear the word, proceeding from himself; his name shall be Christ Jesus the son of Mary, honourable in this world and in the world to come, and one of those who approach near to the presence of God
3|46|and he shall speak unto men in the cradle, and when he is grown up; and he shall be one of the righteous
3|47|She answered, Lord, how shall I have a son, since a man hath not touched me? The Angel said, so God createth that which he pleaseth: When he decreeth a thing, he only saith unto it, be, and it is
3|48|God shall teach him the scripture, and wisdom, and the law, and the gospel
3|49|and shall appoint him his apostle to the children of Israel; and he shall say, verily I come unto you with a sign from your Lord; for I will make before you, of clay, as it were the figure of a bird; then I will breathe thereon, and it shall become a bird, by the permission of God: And I will heal him that hath been blind from his birth; and the leper: And I will raise the dead by the permission of God: And I will prophesy unto you what ye eat, and what ye lay up for store in your houses. Verily herein will be a sign unto you, if ye believe
3|50|And I come to confirm the law which was revealed before me, and to allow unto you as lawful, part of that which hath been forbidden you: And I come unto you with a sign from your Lord; therefore fear God, and obey me
3|51|Verily God is my Lord, and your Lord: Therefore serve him. This is the right way
3|52|But when Jesus perceived their unbelief, he said, who will be my helpers towards God? The apostles answered, we will be the helpers of God; we believe in God, and do thou bear witness that we are true believers
3|53|O Lord, we believe in that which thou hast sent down, and we have followed thy apostle; write us down therefore with those who bear witness of him
3|54|And the Jews devised a stratagem against him; but God devised a stratagem against them; and God is the best deviser of stratagems
3|55|When God said, O Jesus, verily I will cause thee to die, and I will take thee up unto me, and I will deliver thee from the unbelievers; and I will place those who follow thee, above the unbelievers, until the day of resurrection: Then unto me shall ye return, and I will judge between you of that concerning which ye disagree
3|56|Moreover, as for the infidels, I will punish them with a grievous punishment in this world, and in that which is to come; and there shall be none to help them
3|57|But they who believe, and do that which is right, he shall give them their reward; for God loveth not the wicked doers
3|58|These signs, and this prudent admonition do we rehearse unto thee
3|59|Verily the likeness of Jesus in the sight of God, is as the likeness of Adam: He created him out of the dust, and then said unto him, be; and he was
3|60|This is the truth from thy Lord; be not therefore one of those who doubt
3|61|And whoever shall dispute with thee concerning him, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, say unto them, come, let us call together our sons, and your sons, and our wives, and your wives, and our selves, and your selves; then let us make imprecations, and lay the curse of God on those who lie
3|62|Verily this is a true history: And there is no God, but God; and God is most mighty, and wise
3|63|If they turn back, God well knoweth the evil doers
3|64|Say, O ye who have received the scripture, come to a just determination between us and you; that we worship not any except God, and associate no creature with him; and that the one of us take not the other for lords, beside God. But if they turn back, say, bear witness that we are true believers
3|65|O ye to whom the scriptures have been given, why do ye dispute concerning Abraham, since the law and the gospel were not sent down until after him? Do ye not therefore understand
3|66|Behold ye are they who dispute concerning that which ye have some knowledge in; why therefore do ye dispute concerning that which ye have no knowledge of? God knoweth, but ye know not
3|67|Abraham was neither a Jew, nor a Christian; but he was of the true religion, one resigned unto God, and was not of the number of the idolaters
3|68|Verily the men who are the nearest of kin unto Abraham, are they who follow him; and this prophet, and they who believe on him: God is the patron of the faithful
3|69|Some of those who have received the scriptures desire to seduce you; but they seduce themselves only, and they perceive it not
3|70|O ye who have received the scriptures, why do ye not believe in the signs of God, since ye are witnesses of them
3|71|O ye who have received the scriptures, why do ye clothe truth with vanity, and knowingly hide the truth
3|72|And some of those to whom the scriptures were given, say, believe in that which hath been sent down unto those who believe, in the beginning of the day; and deny it in the end thereof; that they may go back from their faith
3|73|And believe him only who followeth your religion. Say, verily the true direction is the direction of God, that there may be given unto some other a revelation like unto what hath been given unto you. Will they dispute with you before your Lord? Say, surely excellence is in the hand of God, he giveth it unto whom he pleaseth; God is bounteous and wise
3|74|He will confer peculiar mercy on whom he pleaseth; for God is indued with great beneficence
3|75|There is of those who have received the scriptures, unto whom if thou trust a talent, he will restore it unto thee; and there is also of them, unto whom is thou trust a dinar, he will not restore it unto thee, unless thou stand over him continually with great urgency. This they do because they say, we are not obliged to observe justice with the heathen: But they utter a lie against God, knowingly
3|76|Yea; whoso keepeth his covenant, and feareth God, God surely loveth those who fear him
3|77|But they who make merchandize of God's covenant, and of their oaths, for a small price, shall have no portion in the next life, neither shall God speak to them or regard them on the day of resurrection, nor shall he cleanse them; but they shall suffer a grievous punishment
3|78|And there are certainly some of them, who read the scriptures perversely, that ye may think what they read to be really in the scriptures, yet it is not in the scripture; and they say, this is from God; but it is not from God: And they speak that which is false concerning God, against their own knowledge
3|79|It is not fit for a man, that God should give him a book of revelations, and wisdom, and prophecy; and then he should say unto men, be ye worshippers of me, besides God; but he ought to say, be ye perfect in knowledge and in works, since ye know the scriptures, and exercise your selves therein
3|80|God hath not commanded you to take the angels and the prophets for your Lords: Will He command you to become infidels, after ye have been true believers
3|81|And remember when God accepted the covenant of the prophets, saying, this verily is the scripture and the wisdom which I have given you: Hereafter shall an apostle come unto you, conforming the truth of that scripture which is with you; ye shall surely believe on Him, and ye shall assist Him. God said, are ye firmly resolved, and do ye accept my covenant on this condition? They answered, we are firmly resolved: God said, be ye therefore witnesses; and I also bear witness with you
3|82|And whosoever turneth back after this, they are surely the transgressors
3|83|Do they therefore seek any other religion but God's? Since to him is resigned whosoever is in heaven or on earth, voluntarily, or of force: And to him shall they return
3|84|Say, we believe in God, and that which hath been sent down unto us, and that which was sent down unto Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which was delivered to Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord; we make no distinction between any of them; and to him are we resigned
3|85|Whoever followeth any other religion than Islam, it shall not be accepted of him: And in the next life he shall be of those who perish
3|86|How shall God direct men who have become infidels after they had believed, and born witness that the apostle was true, and manifest declarations of the divine will had come unto them? For God directeth not the ungodly people
3|87|Their reward shall be, that on them shall fall the curse of God, and of angels, and of all mankind
3|88|They shall remain under the same for ever; their torment shall not be mitigated, neither shall they be regarded
3|89|except those who repent after this, and amend; for God is gracious and merciful
3|90|Moreover they who become infidels after they have believed, and yet increase in infidelity, their repentance shall in no wise be accepted, and they are those who go astray
3|91|Verily they who believe not, and die in their unbelief, the world full of gold shall in no wise be accepted from any of them, even though he should give it for his ransom; they shall suffer a grievous punishment, and they shall have none to help them
3|92|Ye will never attain unto righteousness, until ye give in alms of that which ye love: And whatever ye give, God knoweth it
3|93|All food was permitted unto the children of Israel, except what Israel forbad unto himself, before the Pentateuch was sent down. Say unto the Jews, bring hither the Pentateuch and read it, if ye speak truth
3|94|Whoever therefore contriveth a lie against God after this, they will be evil doers
3|95|Say, God is true: Follow ye therefore the religion of Abraham the orthodox; for he was no idolater
3|96|Verily the first house appointed unto men to worship in was that which is in Becca; blessed, and a direction to all creatures
3|97|Therein are manifest signs: The place where Abraham stood; and whoever entereth therein, shall be safe. And it is a duty towards God, incumbent on those who are able to go thither, to visit this house; but whosoever disbelieveth, verily God needeth not the service of any creature
3|98|Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, why do ye not believe in the signs of God
3|99|Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, why do ye keep back from the way of God, him who believeth? Ye seek to make it crooked, and yet are witnesses that it is the right: But God will not be unmindful of what ye do
3|100|O true believers, if ye obey some of those who have received the scripture, they will render you infidels, after ye have believed
3|101|And how can ye be infidels, when the signs of God are read unto you, and his apostle is among you? But he who cleaveth firmly unto God, is already directed into the right way
3|102|O believers, fear God with his true fear; and die not unless ye also be true believers
3|103|And cleave all of you unto the covenant of God, and depart not from it, and remember the favour of God towards you: Since ye were enemies, and he reconciled your hearts, and ye became companions and brethren by his favour: And ye were on the brink of a pit of fire, and he delivered you thence. Thus God declareth unto you his signs, that ye may be directed
3|104|Let there be people among you, who invite to the best religion; and command that which is just, and forbid that which is evil; and they shall be happy
3|105|And be not as they who are divided, and disagree in matters of religion, after manifest proofs have been brought unto them: They shall suffer a great torment
3|106|On the day of resurrection some faces shall become white, and other faces shall become black. And unto them whose faces shall become black, God will say, have ye returned unto your unbelief, after ye had believed? Therefore taste the punishment, for that ye have been unbelievers
3|107|But they whose faces shall become white shall be in the mercy of God, therein shall they remain for ever
3|108|These are the signs of God: We recite them unto thee with truth. God will not deal unjustly with his creatures
3|109|And to God belongeth whatever is in heaven and on earth; and to God shall all things return
3|110|Ye are the best nation that hath been raised up unto mankind: Ye command that which is just, and ye forbid that which is unjust, and ye believe in God. And if they who have recieved the scriptures had believed, it had surely been the better for them: There are believers among them, but the greater part of them are transgressors
3|111|They shall not hurt you, unless with a slight hurt; and if they fight against you, they shall turn their backs to you; and they shall not be helped
3|112|They are smitten with vileness wheresoever they are found; unless they obtain security by entering into a treaty with God, and a treaty with men: And they draw on themselves indignation from God, and they are afflicted with poverty. This they suffer, because they disbelieved the signs of God, and slew the prophets unjustly; this, because they were rebellious, and transgressed
3|113|Yet they are not all alike: There are of those who have received the scriptures, upright people; they meditate on the signs of God in the night season, and worship
3|114|They believe in God, and the last day; and command that which is just, and forbid that which is unjust, and zealously strive to excel in good works: These are of the righteous
3|115|And ye shall not be denied the reward of the good which ye do; for God knoweth the pious
3|116|As for the unbelievers, their wealth shall not profit them at all, neither their children, against God: They shall be the companions of hell fire; they shall continue therein for ever
3|117|The likeness of that which they lay out in this present life, is as a wind wherein there is a scorching cold: It falleth on the standing corn of those men who have injured their own souls, and destroyeth it. And God dealeth not unjustly with them; but they injure their own souls
3|118|O true believers, contract not an intimate friendship with any besides your selves: They will not fail to corrupt you. They wish for that which may cause you to perish: Their hatred hath already appeared from out of their mouths; but what their breasts conceal is yet more inveterate. We have already shewn you signs of their ill will towards you, if ye understand
3|119|Behold, ye love them, and they do not love you: Ye believe in all the scriptures, and when they meet you, they say, we believe; but when they assemble privately togeher, they bite their fingers ends out of wrath against you. Say unto them, die in your wrath: Verily God knoweth the innermost part of your breasts
3|120|If good happen unto you, it grieveth them; and if evil befall you, they rejoice at it. But if ye be patient, and fear God, their subtlety shall not hurt you at all; for God comprehendeth whatever they do
3|121|Call to mind when thou wentest forth early from thy family, that thou mightest prepare the faithful a camp for war; and God heard and knew it
3|122|when two companies of you were anxiously thoughtful, so that ye became faint-hearted; but God was the supporter of them both; and in God let the faithful trust
3|123|And God had already given you the victory at Bedr, when ye were inferior in number; therefore fear God, that ye may be thankful
3|124|When thou saidst unto the faithful, is it not enough for you, that your Lord should assist you with three thousand angels, sent down from heaven
3|125|Verily if ye persevere, and fear God, and your enemies come upon you suddenly, your Lord will assist you with five thousand angels, distinguished by their horses and attire
3|126|And this God designed only as good tidings for you that your hearts might rest secure: For victory is from God alone, the mighty, the wise
3|127|That he should cut off the uttermost part of the unbelievers, or cast them down, or that they should be overthrown and unsuccessful, is nothing to thee
3|128|It is no business of thine; whether God be turned unto them, or whether he punish them; they are surely unjust doers
3|129|To God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth: He spareth whom he pleaseth, and he punisheth whom he pleaseth; for God is merciful
3|130|O true believers, devour not usury, doubling it twofold; but fear God, that ye may prosper
3|131|And fear the fire which is prepared for the unbelievers
3|132|and obey God, and his apostle, that ye may obtain mercy
3|133|And run with emulation to obtain remission from your Lord, and paradise, whose breadth equalleth the heavens and the earth, which is prepared for the godly
3|134|who give alms in prosperity and adversity; who bridle their anger, and forgive men: For God loveth the beneficent
3|135|And who, after they have committed a crime, or dealt unjustly with their own souls, remember God, and ask pardon for their sins, -- for who forgiveth sins except God? -- and persevere not in what they have done knowingly
3|136|Their reward shall be pardon from their Lord, and gardens wherein rivers flow, they shall remain therein for ever: And how excellent is the reward of those who labour
3|137|There have already been before you examples of punishment of infidels, therefore go through the earth, and behold what hath been the end of those who accuse God's apostles of imposture
3|138|This book is a declaration unto men, and a direction, and an admonition to the pious
3|139|And be not dismayed, neither be ye grieved; for ye shall be superior to the unbelievers if ye believe
3|140|If a wound hath happended unto you in war, a like wound hath already happened unto the unbelieving people: And we cause these days of different success interchangeably to succeed each other among men; that God may know those who believe, and may have martyrs from among you: -- God loveth not the workers of iniquity
3|141|and that God might prove those who believe, and destroy the infidels
3|142|Did ye imagine that ye should enter paradise, when as yet God knew not those among you who fought strenuously in his cause; nor knew those who persevered with patience
3|143|Moreover ye did sometime wish for death before that ye met it; but ye have now seen it, and ye looked on, but retreated from it
3|144|Mohammed is no more than an apostle; the other apostles have already deceased before him: If he die therefore, or be slain, will ye turn back on your heels? But he who turneth back on his heels, will not hurt God at all; and God will surely reward the thankful
3|145|No soul can die unless by the permission of God, according to what is written in the book containing the determinations of things. And whoso chooseth the reward of this world, we will give him thereof: But whoso chooseth the reward of the world to come, we will give him thereof; and we will surely reward the thankful
3|146|How many prophets have encountered those who had many myriads of troops: And yet they desponded not in their mind for what had befallen them in fighting for the religion of God; and were not weakened, neither behaved themselves in an abject manner? God loveth those who persevere patiently
3|147|And their speech was no other than that they said, our Lord forgive us our offences and our transgressions in our business; and confirm our feet, and help us against the unbelieving people
3|148|And God gave them the reward of this world, and a glorious reward in the life to come; for God loveth the well-doers
3|149|O ye who believe, if ye obey the infidels, they will cause you to turn back on your heels, and ye will be turned back and perish
3|150|But God is your Lord; and he is the best helper
3|151|We will surely cast a dread into the hearts of the unbelievers, because they have associated with God that concerning which he sent them down no power: Their dwelling shall be the fire of hell; and the receptacle of the wicked shall be miserable
3|152|God had already made good unto you his promise, when ye destroyed them by his permission, until ye became faint-hearted and disputed concerning the command of the apostle, and were rebellious; after God had shewn you what ye desired. Some of you chose this present world, and others of you chose the world to come. Then he turned you to flight from before them, that he might make trial of you: -- But he hath now pardoned you; for God is indued with beneficence towards the faithful
3|153|when ye went up as ye fled, and looked not back on any; while the apostle called you, in the uttermost part of you. Therefore God rewarded you with affliction on affliction, that ye be not grieved hereafter for the spoils which ye fail of, nor for that which befalleth you; for God is well acquainted with whatever ye do
3|154|Then he sent down upon you after affliction security; a soft sleep which fell on some part of you; but other part were troubled by their own souls; falsely thinking of God a foolish imagination, saying, will any thing of the matter happen unto us? Say, verily the matter belongeth wholly unto God. They concealed in their minds what they declared not unto thee; saying, if any thing of the matter had happened unto us, we had not been slain here. Answer, if ye had been in your houses, verily they would have gone forth to fight, whose slaughter was decreed, to the places where they died, and this came to pass that God might try what was in your breasts, and might discern what was in your hearts; for God knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
3|155|Verily they among you who turned their backs on the day whereon the two armies met each other at Ohod, Satan caused them so slip, for some crime which they had committed: But now hath God forgiven them; for God is gracious and merciful
3|156|O true believers, be not as they who believed not, and said of their brethren, when they had journeyed in the land or had been at war, if they had been with us, those had not died, nor had these been slain: Whereas what befell them was so ordained that God might make it matter of sighing in their hearts. God giveth life, and causeth to die: And God seeth that which ye do
3|157|Moreover if ye be slain, or die in defence of the religion of God; verily pardon from God, and mercy is better than what they heap together of worldly riches
3|158|And if ye die, or be slain, verily unto God shall ye be gathered
3|159|And as to the mercy granted unto the disobedient from God, thou O Mohammed hast been mild towards them; but if thou hadst been severe, and hard-hearted, they had surely separated themselves from about thee. Therefore forgive them, and ask pardon for them: And consult them in the affair of war; and after thou hast deliberated, trust in God; for God loveth those who trust in Him
3|160|If God help you, none shall conquer you; but if he desert you, who is it that will help you after Him? Therefore in God let the faithful trust
3|161|It is not the part of a prophet to defraud, for he who defraudeth, shall bring with him what he hath defrauded any one of, on the day of the resurrection. Then shall every soul be paid what he hath gained; and they shall not be treated unjustly
3|162|Shall he therefore who followeth that which is well-pleasing unto God, be as he who bringeth on himself wrath from God, and whose receptacle is hell? An evil journey shall it be thither
3|163|There shall be degrees of rewards and punishments with God, for God seeth what they do
3|164|Now hath God been gracious unto the believers when he raised up among them an apostle of their own nation, who should recite his signs unto them, and purify them, and teach them the book of the Koran and wisdom; whereas they were before in manifest error
3|165|After a misfortune hath befallen you at Ohod, -- ye had already obtained two equal advantages -- do ye say, whence cometh this? Answer, this is from yourselves: For God is almighty
3|166|And what happened unto you, on the day whereon the two armies met, was certainly by the permission of God; and that he might know the faithful
3|167|and that he might know the ungodly. It was said unto them, come, fight for the religion of God, or drive back the enemy: They answered, if we had known ye went out to fight, we had certainly followed you. They were on that day nearer unto unbelief, than they were to faith; they spake with their mouths, what was not in their hearts: But God perfectly knew what they concealed
3|168|who said of their brethren, while themselves staid at home, if they had obeyed us, they had not been slain. Say, then keep back death from yourselves, if ye say truth
3|169|Thou shalt in no wise reckon those who have been slain at Ohod in the cause of God, dead; nay, they are sustained alive with their Lord
3|170|rejoicing for what God of his favour hath granted them; and being glad for those, who coming after them, have not as yet overtaken them; because there shall no fear come on them, neither shall they be grieved
3|171|They are filled with joy for the favour which they have received from God, and his bounty; and for that God suffereth not the reward of the faithful to perish
3|172|They who hearkened unto God and his apostle, after a wound had befallen them at Ohod, such of them as do good works, and fear God, shall have a great reward
3|173|unto whom certain men said, verily the men of Mecca have already gathered forces against you, be ye therefore afraid of them: But this increased their faith, and they said, God is our support, and the most excellent patron
3|174|Wherefore they returned with favour from God, and advantage; no evil befell them: And they followed what was well pleasing unto God; for God is endowed with great liberality
3|175|Verily that devil would cause you to fear his friends: But be ye not afraid of them; but fear me, if ye be true believers
3|176|They shall not grieve thee, who emulously hasten unto infidelity; for they shall never hurt God at all. God will not give them a part in the next life, and they shall suffer a great punishment
3|177|Surely those who purchase infidelity with faith, shall by no means hurt God at all, but they shall suffer a grievous punishment
3|178|And let not the unbelievers think, because we grant them lives long and prosperous, that it is better for their souls: We grant them long and prosperous lives only that their iniquity may be increased; and they shall suffer an ignominious punishment
3|179|God is not disposed to leave the faithful in the condition which ye are now in, until he sever the wicked from the good; nor is God disposed to make you acquainted with what is a hidden secret, but God chooseth such of his apostles as he pleaseth, to reveal his mind unto: Believe therefore in God, and his apostles; and if ye believe, and fear God, ye shall receive a great reward
3|180|And let not those who covetous of what God of his bounty hath granted them, imagine that their avarice is better for them: Nay, rather it is worse for them. That which they have covetously reserved shall be bound as a collar about their neck, on the day of the resurrection: Unto God belongeth the inheritance of heaven and earth; and God is well acquainted with what ye do
3|181|God hath already heard the saying of those who said, verily God is poor, and we are rich: We will surely write down what they have said, and the slaughter which they have made of the prophets without a cause; and we will say unto them, taste ye the pain of burning
3|182|This shall they suffer for the evil which their hands have sent before them; and because God is not unjust towards mankind
3|183|who also say, surely God hath commanded us, that we should not give credit to any apostle, until one should come unto us with a sacrifice, which should be consumed by fire. Say, apostles have already come unto you before me, with plain proofs, and with the miracle which ye mention: Why therefore have ye slain them, if ye speak truth
3|184|If they accuse thee of imposture, the apostles before thee have also been accounted impostors, who brought evident demonstrations, and the scriptures, and the book which enlighteneth the understanding
3|185|Every soul shall taste of death, and ye shall have your rewards on the day of resurrection; and he who shall be far removed from hell fire, and shall be admitted into paradise, shall be happy: But the present life is only a deceitful provision
3|186|Ye shall surely be proved in your possessions, and in your persons; and ye shall hear from those unto whom the scripture was delivered before you, and from the idolaters, much hurt: But if ye be patient, and fear God, this is a matter that is absolutely determined
3|187|And when God accepted the covenant of those to whom the book of the law was given, saying, ye shall surely publish it unto mankind, ye shall not hide it: Yet they threw it behind their backs, and sold it for a small price; but woful is the price for which they have sold it
3|188|Think not that they who rejoice at what they have done, and expect to be praised for what they have not done; think not, O prophet, that they shall escape from punishment, for they shall suffer a painful punishment
3|189|and unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth: God is almighty
3|190|Now in the creation of heaven and earth, and the vicissitude of night and day, are signs unto those who are indued with understanding
3|191|who remember God standing, and sitting, and lying on their sides; and meditate on the creation of heaven and earth, saying, O Lord, thou hast not created this in vain; far be it from thee: Therefore deliver us from the torment of hell fire
3|192|O Lord, surely whom thou shalt throw into the fire, thou wilt also cover with shame: Nor shall the ungodly have any to help them
3|193|O Lord, we have heard a preacher inviting us to the faith, and saying, believe in your Lord: And we believed. O Lord, forgive us therefore our sins, and expiate our evil deeds from us, and make us to die with the righteous
3|194|O Lord, give us also the reward which thou hast promised by thy apostles; and cover us not with shame on the day of resurrection; for thou art not contrary to the promise
3|195|Their Lord therefore answereth them, saying, I will not suffer the work of him among you who worketh to be lost, whether he be male, or female: The one of you is from the other. They therefore who have left their country, and have been turned out of their houses, and have suffered for my sake, and have been slain in battle; verily I will expiate their evil deeds from them, and I will surely bring them into gardens watered by rivers: a reward from God: And with God is the most excellent reward
3|196|Let not the prosperous dealing of the unbelievers in the land, deceive thee
3|197|It is but a slender provision; and then their receptacle shall be hell; an unhappy couch shall it be
3|198|But they who fear their Lord shall have gardens through which rivers flow, they shall continue therein for ever : This is the gift of God; for what is with God shall be better for the righteous than short-lived worldly prosperity
3|199|There are some of those who have received the scriptures, who believe in God, and that which hath been sent down unto you, and that which hath been sent down to them, submitting themselves unto God; they sell not the signs of God for a small price: These shall have their reward with their Lord; for God is swift in taking an account
3|200|O true believers, be patient, and strive to excel in patience, and be constant-minded, and fear God, that ye may be happy
4|1|O men, fear your Lord, who hath created you out of one man, and out of him created his wife, and from them two hath multiplied many men, and women: And fear God by whom ye beseech one another; and respect women who have born you, for God is watching over you
4|2|And give the orphans when they come to age their substance; and render them not in exchange bad for good: And devour not their substance, by adding it to your own substance; for this is a great sin
4|3|And if ye fear that ye shall not act with equity towards orphans of the female sex, take in marriage of such other women as please you, two, or three, or four, and not more. But if ye fear that ye cannot act equitably towards so many, marry one only, or the slaves which ye shall have acquired. This will be easier, that ye swerve not from righteousness
4|4|And give women their dowry freely; but if they voluntarily remit unto you any part of it, enjoy it with satisfaction and advantage
4|5|And give not unto those who are weak of understanding, the substance which God hath appointed you to preserve for them; but maintain them thereout, and clothe them, and speak kindly unto them
4|6|And examine the orphans until they attain the age of marriage: But if ye perceive they are able to manage their affairs well, deliver their substance unto them; and waste it not extravagantly, or hastily, because they grow up. Let him who is rich abstain entirely from the orphans estates; and let him who is poor take thereof according to what shall be reasonable. And when ye deliver their substance unto them, call witnesses thereof in their presence: God taketh sufficient account of your actions
4|7|Men ought to have a part of what their parents and kindred leave behind them when they die: And women also ought to have a part of what their parents and kindred leave, whether it be little, or whether it be much; a determinate part is due to them
4|8|And when they who are of kin are present at the dividing of what is left, and also the orphans, and the poor; distribute unto them some part thereof; and if the estate be too small, at least speak comfortably unto them
4|9|And let those fear to abuse orphans, who if they leave behind them a weak off-spring, are sollicitous for them: let them therefore fear God, and speak that which is convenient
4|10|Surely they who devour the possessions of orphans unjustly, shall swallow down nothing but fire into their bellies, and shall broil in raging flames
4|11|God hath thus commanded you concerning your children. A male shall have as much as the share of two females: But if they be females only, and above two in number, they shall have two third parts of what the deceased shall leave; and if there be but one, she shall have the half. And the parents of the deceased shall have each of them a sixth part of what he shall leave, if he have a child: But if he have no child, and his parents be his heirs, then his mother shall have the third part. And if he have brethren, his mother shall have a sixth part, after the legacies which he shall bequeath, and his debts be paid. Ye know not whether your parents or your children be of greater use unto you. This is an ordinance from God, and God is knowing and wise
4|12|Moreover ye may claim half of what your wives shall leave, if they have no issue; but if they have issue, then ye shall have the fourth part of what they shall leave, after the legacies which they shall bequeath, and the debts be paid. They also shall have the fourth part of what ye shall leave, in case ye have no issue; but if ye have issue, then they shall have the eighth part of what ye shall leave, after the legacies which ye shall bequeath, and your debts be paid. And if a man or woman's substance be inherited by a distant relation, and he or she have a brother or sister; each of them two shall have a sixth part of the estate. But if there be more than this number, they shall be equal sharers in a third part, after payment of the legacies which shall be bequeathed, and the debts, without prejudice to the heirs. This is an ordinance from God: And God is knowing and gracious
4|13|These are the statutes of God. And whoso obeyeth God and his apostle, God shall lead him into gardens wherein rivers flow, they shall continue therein for ever; and this shall be great happiness
4|14|But whoso disobeyeth God, and his apostle, and transgresseth his statutes, God shall cast him into hell fire; he shall remain therein for ever, and he shall suffer a shameful punishment
4|15|If any of your women be guilty of whoredom, produce four witnesses from among you against them, and if they bear witness against them, imprison them in separate apartments until death release them, or God affordeth them a way to escape
4|16|And if two of you commit the like wickedness, punish them both: But if they repent and amend, let them both alone; for God is easy to be reconciled and merciful
4|17|Verily repentance will be accepted with God, from those who do evil ignorantly, and then repent speedily; unto them will God be turned: For God is knowing and wise
4|18|But no repentance shall be accepted from those who do evil until the time when death presenteth it self unto one of them, and he saith, verily I repent now; nor unto those who die unbelievers: For them have we prepared a grievous punishment
4|19|O true believers, it is not lawful for you to be heirs of women against their will, nor to hinder them from marrying others, that ye may take away part of what ye have given them in dowry; unless they have been guilty of a manifest crime: But converse kindly with them. And if ye hate them, it may happen that ye may hate a thing wherein God hath placed much good
4|20|If ye be desirous to exchange a wife for another wife, and ye have already given one of them a talent; take not away any thing therefrom; Will ye take it by slandering her, and doing her manifest unjustice
4|21|And how can ye take it, since the one of you hath gone in unto the other, and they have received from you a firm covenant
4|22|Marry not women, whom your fathers have had to wife; -- except what is already past: -- For this is uncleanness, and an abomination, and an evil way
4|23|Ye are forbidden to marry your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your aunts both on the fathers and on the mothers side, and your brothers daughters, and your sisters daughters, and your mothers who have given you suck, and your foster-sisters, and your wives mothers, and your daughters-in-law which are under your tuition, born of your wives unto whom ye have gone in, -- but if ye have not gone in unto them, it shall be no sin in you to marry them, -- and the wives of your sons who proceed out of your loins; and ye are also forbidden to take to wife two sisters; except what is already past: For God is gracious and merciful
4|24|Ye are also forbidden to take to wife free women who are married, except those women whom your right hands shall possess as slaves. This is ordained you from God. Whatever is beside this, is allowed you; that ye may with your substance provide wives for your selves, acting that which is right, and avoiding whoredom. And for the advantage which ye receive from them, give them their reward, according to what is ordained: But it shall be no crime in you to make any other agreement among your selves, after the ordinance shall be complied with; for God is knowing and wise
4|25|Whoso among you hath not means sufficient that he may marry free women, who are believers, let him marry with such of your maid-servants whom your right hands possess, as are true believers; for God well knoweth your faith. Ye are the one from the other: Therefore marry them with the consent of their masters; and give them their dower according to justice; such as are modest, not guilty of whoredom, nor entertaining lovers. And when they are married, if they be guilty of adultery, they shall suffer half the punishment which is appointed for the free women. This is allowed unto him among you, who feareth to sin by marrying free women; but if ye abstain from marrying slaves, it will be better for you; God is gracious and merciful
4|26|God is willing to declare these things unto you and to direct you according to the ordinances of those who have gone before you, and to be merciful unto you. God is knowing and wise
4|27|God desireth to be gracious unto you; but they who follow their lusts, desire that ye should turn aside from the truth with great deviation
4|28|God is minded to make His religion light unto you: For man was created weak
4|29|O true believers, consume not your wealth among your selves in vanity; unless there be merchandizing among you by mutual consent: neither slay your selves; for God is merciful towards you
4|30|And whoever doth this maliciously and wickedly, he will surely cast him to be broiled in hell fire; and this is easy with God
4|31|If ye turn aside from the grievous sins, of those which ye are forbidden to commit, we will cleanse you from your smaller faults; and will introduce you into paradise with an honourable entry
4|32|Covet not that which God hath bestowed on some of you preferably to others. Unto the men shall be given a portion, of what they shall have gained, and unto the women shall be given a portion, of what they shall have gained: Therefore ask God of his bounty; for God is omniscient
4|33|We have appointed unto every one kindred, to inherit part of what their parents and relations shall leave at their deaths. And unto those with whom your right hands have made an alliance, give their part of the inheritance; for God is witness of all things
4|34|Men shall have the pre-eminence above women, because of those advantages wherein God hath caused the one of them to excel the other, and for that which they expend of their substance in maintaining their wives. The honest women are obedient, careful in the absence of their husbands, for that God preserveth them, by committing them to the care and protection of the men. But those, whose perverseness ye shall be apprehensive of, rebuke; and remove them into separate apartments, and chastise them. But if they shall be obedient unto you, seek not an occasion of quarrel against them; for God is high and great
4|35|And if ye fear a breach between the husband and wife, send a judge out of his family, and a judge out of her family: If they shall desire a reconciliation, God will cause them to agree; for God is knowing and wise
4|36|Serve God, and associate no creature with him; and shew kindness unto parents, and relations, and orphans, and the poor, and your neighbour who is of kin to you, and also your neighbour who is a stranger, and to your familiar companion, and the traveller, and the captives whom your right hands shall possess
4|37|for God loveth not the proud or vainglorious, who are covetous, and recommend covetousness unto men, and conceal that which God of his bounty hath given them, -- we have prepared a shameful punishment for the unbelievers
4|38|and who bestow their wealth in charity to be observed of men, and believe not in God, nor in the last day; and whoever hath Satan for a companion, an evil companion hath he
4|39|And what harm would befall them if they should believe in God, and the last day, and give alms out of that which God hath bestowed on them? Since God knoweth them who do this
4|40|Verily God will not wrong any one even the weight of an ant: And if it be a good action, he will double it, and will recompense it in his sight with a great reward
4|41|How will it be with the unbelievers, when we shall bring a witness out of each nation against itself, and shall bring thee, O Mohammed, a witness against these people
4|42|In that day they who have not believed, and have rebelled against the apostle of God, shall wish the earth was levelled with them; and they shall not be able to hide any matter from God
4|43|O true believer , come not to prayer when ye are drunk, until ye understand what ye say; nor when ye are polluted by emission of seed, unless ye be travelling on the road, until ye wash yourselves. But if ye be sick, or on a journey, or any of you come from easing nature, or have touched women, and find no water; take fine clean sand and rub your faces and your hands therewith; for God is merciful and inclined to forgive
4|44|Hast thou not observed those unto whom part of the scripture was delivered? They sell error, and desire that ye may wander from the right way
4|45|but God well knoweth your enemies. God is a sufficient patron, and God is a sufficient helper
4|46|Of the Jews there are some who pervert words from their places; and say, we have heard, and have disobeyed; and do thou hear without understanding our meaning, and look upon us: Perplexing with their tongues, and reviling the true religion. But if they had said, we have heard, and do obey; and do thou hear, and regard us: Certainly it were better for them, and more right. But God hath cursed them by reason of their infidelity; therefore a few of them only shall believe
4|47|O ye to whom the scriptures have been given, believe in the revelation which we have sent down, confirming that which is with you; before we deface your countenances, and render them as the back parts thereof; or curse them, as we cursed those who transgressed on the sabbath day; and the command of God was fulfilled
4|48|Surely God will not pardon the giving Him an equal; but will pardon any other sin, except that, to whom He pleaseth: And whoso giveth a companion unto God, hath devised a great wickedness
4|49|Hast thou not observed those who justify themselves? But God justifieth whomsoever He pleaseth, nor shall they be wronged a hair
4|50|Behold, how they imagine a lie against God; and therein is iniquity sufficiently manifest
4|51|Hast thou not considered those to whom part of the scripture hath been given? They believe in false gods and idols, and say of those who believe not, these are more rightly directed in the way of truth, than they who believe on Mohammed
4|52|Those are the men whom God hath cursed; and unto him whom God shall curse, thou shalt surely find no helper
4|53|Shall they have a part of the kingdom, since even then they would not bestow the smallest matter on men
4|54|Do they envy other men that which God of his bounty hath given them? We formerly gave unto the family of Abraham a book of revelations and wisdom; and we gave them a great kingdom
4|55|There is of them who believeth on Him; and there is of them who turneth aside from Him: But the raging fire of hell is a sufficient punishment
4|56|Verily those who disbelieve our signs, we will surely cast to be broiled in hell fire; so often as their skins shall be well burned, we will give them other skins in exchange, that they may taste the sharper torment; for God is mighty and wise
4|57|But those who believe and do that which is right, we will bring into gardens watered by rivers, therein shall they remain for ever, and there shall they enjoy wives free from all impurity; and we will lead them into perpetual shades
4|58|Moreover God commandeth you to restore what ye are trusted with, to the owners; and when ye judge between men, that ye judge according to equity: And surely an excellent virtue it is to which God exhorteth you; for God both heareth and seeth
4|59|O true believers, obey God, and obey the apostle, and those who are in authority among you, and if ye differ in any thing, refer it unto God and the apostle, if ye believe in God, and the last day: This is better, and a fairer method of determination
4|60|Hast thou not observed those who pretend they believe in what hath been revealed unto thee, and what been revealed before thee? They desire to go to judgment before Taghut, although they have been commanded not to believe in him; and Satan desireth to seduce them into a wide error
4|61|And when it is said unto them, come unto the book which God hath sent down, and to the apostle; thou seest the ungodly turn aside from thee, with great aversion
4|62|But how will they behave when a misfortune shall befall them, for that which their hands have sent before them? Then will they come unto thee, and swear by God, saying, if we intended any other, than to do good, and to reconcile the parties
4|63|God knoweth what is in the hearts of these men; therefore let them alone, and admonish them, and speak unto them a word which may affect their souls
4|64|We have not sent any apostle, but that he might be obeyed by the permission of God: But if they, after they have injured their own souls, come unto thee, and ask pardon of God, and the apostle ask pardon for them, they shall surely find God easy to be reconciled and merciful
4|65|And by thy Lord they will not perfectly believe, until they make thee judge of their controversies; and shall not afterwards find in their own minds any hardship in what thou shalt determine, but shall acquiesce therein with entire submission
4|66|And if we had commanded them, saying, slay your selves, or depart from your houses; they would not have done it, except a few of them. And if they had done what they were admonished, it would certainly have been better for them, and more efficacious for confirming their faith
4|67|and we should then have surely given them in our sight an exceeding great reward
4|68|and we should have directed them in the right way
4|69|Whoever obeyeth God and the apostle, they shall be with those unto whom God hath been gracious, of the prophets, and the sincere, and the martyrs, and the righteous; and these are the most excellent company
4|70|This is bounty from God; and God is sufficiently knowing
4|71|O true believers, take your necessary precaution against your enemies, and either go forth to war in separate parties, or go forth all together in a body
4|72|There is of you who tarrieth behind; and if a misfortune befall you, he saith, verily God hath been gracious unto me, that I was not present with them
4|73|But if success attend you from God, he will say, -- as if there was no friendship between you and him, -- would to God I had been with them, for I should have acquired great merit
4|74|Let them therefore fight for the religion of God, who part with the present life in exchange for that which is to come; for whosoever fighteth for the religion of God, whether he be slain, or be victorious, we will surely give him a great reward
4|75|And what ails you, that ye fight not for God's true religion, and in defence of the weak among men, women, and children, who say, O Lord, bring us forth from this city, whose inhabitants are wicked; grant us from before thee a protector, and grant us from before thee a defender
4|76|They who believe fight for the religion of God; but they who believe not fight for the religion of Taghut. Fight therefore against the friends of Satan, for the stratagem of Satan is weak
4|77|Hast thou not observed those unto whom it was said, withhold your hands from war, and be constant at prayers, and pay the legal alms? But when war is commanded them, behold, a part of them fear men as they should fear God, or with a greater fear, and say, O Lord, wherefore hast thou commanded us to go to war, and hast not suffered us to wait our approaching end? Say unto them, The provision of this life is but small; but the future shall be better for him who feareth God; and ye shall not be in the least injured at the day of judgment
4|78|Wheresoever ye be, death will overtake you, although ye be in lofty towers. If good befall them, they say, this is from God; but if evil befall them, they say, this is from thee, O Mohammed: Say, all is from God; and what aileth these people, that they are so far from understanding what is said unto them
4|79|Whatever good befalleth thee, O man it is from God; and whatever evil befalleth thee, it is from thy self. We have sent thee an apostle unto men, and God is a sufficient witness thereof
4|80|Whoever obeyeth the apostle, obeyeth God; and whoever turneth back, we have not sent thee to be a keeper over them
4|81|They say, obedience: Yet when they go forth from thee, part of them meditate by night a matter different from what thou speakest; but God shall write down what they meditate by night: Therefore let them alone, and trust in God, for God is a sufficient protector
4|82|Do they not attentively consider the Koran? If it had been from any besides God, they would certainly have found therein many contradictions
4|83|When any news cometh unto them, either of security or fear, they immediately divulge it; but if they told it to the apostle and to those who are in authority among them, such of them would understand the truth of the matter, as inform themselves thereof from the apostle and his chiefs. And if the favour of God and his mercy had not been upon you, ye had followed the devil, except a few of you
4|84|Fight therefore for the religion of God, and oblige not any to what is difficult, except thy self; however excite the faithful to war, perhaps God will restrain the courage of the unbelievers; for God is stronger than they, and more able to punish
4|85|He who intercedeth between men with a good intercession shall have a portion thereof; and he who intercedeth with an evil intercession shall have a portion thereof; for God overlooketh all things
4|86|When ye are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation, or at least return the same; for God taketh an account of all things
4|87|God! There is no God but He; He will surely gather you together on the day of resurrection; there is no doubt of it: And who is more true than God in what he saith
4|88|Why are ye divided concerning the ungodly into two parties; since God hath overturned them for what they have committed? Will ye direct him whom God hath led astray; since for him whom God shall lead astray, thou shalt find no true path
4|89|They desire that ye should become infidels, as they are infidels, and that ye should be equally wicked with themselves. Therefore take not friends from among them, until they fly their country for the religion of God; and if they turn back from the faith, take them, and kill them where-ever ye find them; and take no friend from among them, nor any helper
4|90|except those who go unto a people who are in alliance with you, or those who come unto you, their hearts forbidding them either to fight against you, or to fight against their own people. And if God pleased He would have permitted them to have prevailed against you, and they would have fought against you. But if they depart from you, and fight not against you, and offer you peace, God doth not allow you to take or kill of them
4|91|Ye shall find others who are desirous to enter into a confidence with you, and at the same time to preserve a confidence with their own people: So often as they return to sedition, they shall be subverted therein; and if they depart not from you, and offer you peace, and restrain their hands from warring against you, take them and kill them wheresoever ye find them; over these have we granted you a manifest power
4|92|It is not lawful for a believer to kill a believer, unless it happen by mistake; and whoso killeth a believer by mistake, the penalty shall be the freeing of a believer from slavery, and a fine to be paid to the family of the deceased, unless they remit it as alms: And if the slain person be of a people at enmity with you, and be a true believer, the penalty shall be the freeing of a believer; but if he be of a people in confederacy with you, a fine to be paid to his family, and the freeing of a believer. And he who findeth not wherewith to do this, shall fast two months consecutively, as a penance enjoined from God; and God is knowing and wise
4|93|But whoso killeth a believer designedly, his reward shall be hell; he shall remain therein for ever; and God shall be angry with him; and shall curse him, and shall prepare for him a great punishment
4|94|O true believers, when ye are on a march in defence of the true religion, justly discern such as ye shall happen to meet, and say not unto him who saluteth you, thou art not a true believer; seeking the accidental goods of the present life; for with God is much spoil: Such have ye formerly been; but God hath been gracious unto you; therefore make a just discernment, for God is well acquainted with that which ye do
4|95|Those believers who sit still at home, not having any hurt, and those who employ their fortunes and their persons for the religion of God, shall not be held equal. God hath preferred those who employ their fortunes and their persons in that cause, to a degree of honour above those who sit at home: God hath indeed promised every one paradise, but God hath preferred those who fight for the faith before those who sit still
4|96|by adding unto them a great reward, by degrees of honour conferred on them from him, and by granting them forgiveness, and mercy; for God is indulgent and merciful
4|97|Moreover unto those whom the angels put to death, having injured their own souls, the angels said, of what religion were ye? They answered, we were weak in the earth. The angels replied, was not God's earth wide enough, that ye might fly therein to a place of refuge? Therefore their habitation shall be hell; and an evil journey shall it be thither
4|98|Except the weak among men, and women, and children, who were not able to find means, and were not directed in the way
4|99|these peradventure God will pardon, for God is ready to forgive and gracious
4|100|Whosoever flieth from his country for the sake of God's true religion, shall find in the earth many forced to do the same, and plenty of provisions. And whoever departeth from his house, and flieth unto God and his apostle, if death overtake him in the way, God will be obliged to reward him, for God is gracious and merciful
4|101|When ye march to war in the earth, it shall be no crime in you if ye shorten your prayers, in case ye fear the infidels may attack you; for the infidels are your open enemy
4|102|But when thou, O prophet, shalt be among them, and shalt pray with them, let a party of them arise to prayer with thee, and let them take their arms; and when they shall have worshipped, let them stand behind you, and let another party come that hath not prayed, and let them pray with thee, and let them be cautious and take their arms. The unbelievers would that ye should neglect your arms and your baggage while ye pray, that they might turn upon you at once. It shall be no crime in you, if ye be incommoded by rain, or be sick, that ye lay down your arms; but take your necessary precaution: God hath prepared for the unbelievers an ignominious punishment
4|103|And when ye shall have ended your prayer, remember God, standing, and sitting, and lying on your sides. But when ye are secure from danger, complete your prayer; for prayer is commanded the faithful, and appointed to be said at the stated times
4|104|Be not negligent in seeking out the unbelieving people, though ye suffer some inconvenience; for they also shall suffer, as ye suffer, and ye hope for a reward from God which they cannot hope for; and God is knowing and wise
4|105|We have sent down unto thee the book of the Koran with truth; that thou mayest judge between men through that wisdom which God sheweth thee therein; and be not an advocate for the fraudulent
4|106|but ask pardon of God for thy wrong intention, since God is indulgent and merciful
4|107|Dispute not for those who deceive one another, for God loveth not him who is a deceiver or unjust
4|108|Such conceal themselves from men, but they conceal not themselves from God; for He is with them when they imagine by night a saying which pleaseth Him not, and God comprehendeth what they do
4|109|Behold, ye are they who have disputed for them in this present life; but who shall dispute with God for them on the day of resurrection, or who will become their patron
4|110|Yet he who doth evil, or injureth his own soul, and afterwards asketh pardon of God, shall find God gracious and merciful
4|111|Whoso committeth wickedness, committeth it against his own soul: God is knowing and wise
4|112|And whoso committeth a sin or iniquity, and afterwards layeth it on the innocent, he shall surely bear the guilt of calumny and manifest injustice
4|113|If the indulgence and mercy of God had not been upon thee, surely a part of them had studied to seduce thee; but they shall seduce themselves only, and shall not hurt thee at all. God hath sent down unto thee the book of the Koran and wisdom, and hath taught thee that which thou knewest not; for the favour of God hath been great towards thee
4|114|There is no good in the multitude of their private discourses, unless in the discourse of him who recommendeth alms, or that which is right, or agreement amongst men: Whoever doth this out of a desire to please God, We will surely give him a great reward
4|115|But whoso separateth himself from the apostle, after true direction hath been manifested unto him, and followeth any other way, than that of the true believers, we will cause him to obtain that to which he is inclined, and will cast him to be burned in hell; and an unhappy journey shall it be thither
4|116|Verily God will not pardon the giving Him a companion, but He will pardon any crime besides that, unto whom He pleaseth: And he who giveth a companion unto God, is surely led aside into a wide mistake
4|117|The infidels invoke beside Him only female deities; and only invoke rebellious Satan
4|118|God cursed him; and he said, verily I will take of thy servants a part cut off from the rest
4|119|and I will seduce them, and will insinuate vain desires into them, and I will command them and they shall cut off the ears of cattle; and I will command them and they shall change God's creature. But whoever taketh Satan for his patron, besides God, shall surely perish with a manifest destruction
4|120|He maketh them promises, and insinuateth into them vain desires; yet Satan maketh them only deceitful promises
4|121|The receptacle of these shall be hell, they shall find no refuge from it
4|122|But they who believe, and do good works, We will surely lead them into gardens, through which rivers flow, they shall continue therein for ever, according to the true promise of God; and who is more true than God in what He saith
4|123|It shall not be according to your desires, nor according to the desires of those who have received the scriptures. Whoso doth evil, shall be rewarded for it; and shall not find any patron or helper, beside God
4|124|but whoso doth good works, whether he be male or female, and is a true believer; they shall be admitted into paradise, and shall not in the least be unjustly dealt with
4|125|Who is better in point of religion, than he who resigneth himself unto God, and is a worker of righteousness, and followeth the law of Abraham the orhodox? Since God took Abraham for his friend
4|126|And to God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; God comprehendeth all things
4|127|They will consult thee concerning women; answer, God instructeth you concerning them, and that which is read unto you in the book of the Koran concerning female orphans, to whom ye give not that which is ordained them, neither will ye marry them, and concerning weak infants, and that ye observe justice towards orphans: Whatever good ye do, God knoweth it
4|128|If a woman fear ill usage, or aversion from her husband, it shall be no crime in them if they agree the matter amicably between themselves; for a reconciliation is better than a separation. Mens souls are naturally inclined to covetousness: But if ye be kind towards women, and fear to wrong them, God is well acquainted with what ye do
4|129|Ye can by no means carry your selves equally between women in all respects, although ye study to do it; Therefore turn not from a wife with all manner of aversion, nor leave her like one in suspense: If ye agree, and fear to abuse your wives, God is gracious and merciful
4|130|but if they separate, God will satisfy them both of His abundance; for God is extensive and wise
4|131|and unto God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth. We have already commanded those unto whom the scriptures were given before you, and we command you also, saying, fear God; but if ye disbelieve, unto God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; and God is self-sufficient, and to be praised
4|132|for unto God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth, and God is a sufficient protector
4|133|If He pleaseth He will take you away, O men, and will produce others in your stead; for God is able to do this
4|134|Whoso desireth the reward of this world, verily with God is the reward of this world, and also of that which is to come; God both heareth and seeth
4|135|O true believers, observe justice when ye bear witness before God, although it be against your selves, or your parents, or relations; whether the party be rich, or whether he be poor; for God is more worthy than them both: Therefore follow not your own lust in bearing testimony, so that ye swerve from justice. And whether ye wrest your evidence, or decline giving it, God is well acquainted with that which ye do
4|136|O true believers, believe in God and his apostle, and the book which he hath caused to descend unto his apostle, and the book which He hath formerly sent down. And whosoever believeth not in God, and his angels, and his scriptures, and his apostles, and the last day, he surely erreth in a wide mistake
4|137|Moreover they who believed, and afterwards became infidels, and then believed again, and after that disbelieved, and increased in infidelity, God will by no means forgive them, nor direct them into the right way
4|138|Declare unto the ungodly that they shall suffer a painful punishment
4|139|They who take the unbelievers for their protectors, besides the faithful, do they seek for power with them? Since all power belongeth unto God
4|140|And he hath already revealed unto you, in the book of the Koran, the following passage, when ye shall hear the signs of God, they shall not be believed, but they shall be laughed to scorn. Therefore sit not with them who believe not, until they engage in different discourse; for if ye do ye will certainly become like unto them. God will surely gather the ungodly and the unbelievers together in hell
4|141|They who wait to observe what befalleth you, if victory be granted you from God, say, were we not with you? But if any advantage happen to the infidels, they say unto them, were we not superior to you, and have we not defended you against the believers? God shall judge between you on the day of resurrection; and God will not grant the unbelievers means to prevail over the faithful
4|142|The hypocrites act deceitfully with God, but he will deceive them; and when they stand up to pray, they stand carelesly, affecting to be seen of men, and remember not God, unless a little
4|143|wavering between faith and infidelity, and adhering neither unto these nor unto those: And for him whom God shall lead astray, thou shalt find no true path
4|144|O true believers, take not the unbelievers for your protectors, besides the faithful. Will ye furnish God with an evident argument of impiety against you
4|145|Moreover the hypocrites shall be in the lowest bottom of hell fire, and thou shalt not find any to help them thence
4|146|But they who repent and amend, and adhere firmly unto God, and approve the sincerity of their religion to God, they shall be numbered with the faithful; and God will surely give the faithful a great reward
4|147|And how should God go about to punisth you, if ye be thankful and believe? For God is grateful and wise
4|148|God loveth not the speaking ill of any one in public, unless he who is injured call for assistance; and God heareth and knoweth
4|149|Whether ye publish a good action, or conceal it, or forgive evil, verily God is gracious and powerful
4|150|They who believe not in God, and his apostles, and would make a distinction between God and his apostles, and say, we believe in some of the prophets and reject others of them, and seek to take a middle way in this matter
4|151|these are really unbelievers: And we have prepared for the unbelievers an ignominious punishment
4|152|But they who believe in God and his apostles, and make no distinction between any of them, unto those will we surely give their reward; and God is gracious and merciful
4|153|They who have received the scriptures will demand of thee, that thou cause a book to descend unto them from heaven: They formerly asked of Moses a greater thing than this; for they said, shew us God visibly. Wherefore a storm of fire from heaven destroyed them, because of their iniquity. Then they took the calf for their God, after that evident proofs of the divine unity had come unto them: But we forgave them that, and gave Moses a manifest power to punish them
4|154|And we lifted the mountain of Sinai over them, when we exacted from them their covenant; and said unto them, enter the gate of the city worshipping. We also said unto them, transgress not on the sabbath day. And we received from them a firm covenant, that they would observe these things
4|155|Therefore for that they have made void their covenant, and have not believed in the signs of God, and have slain the prophets unjustly, and have said, our hearts are uncircumcised; -- but God hath sealed them up, because of their unbelief; therefore they shall not believe, except a few of them
4|156|And for that they have not believed on Jesus, and have spoken against Mary a grievous calumny
4|157|and have said, verily we have slain Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the apostle of God; yet they slew him not, neither crucified him, but he was represented by one in his likeness; and verily they who disagreed concerning him, were in a doubt as to this matter, and had no sure knowledge thereof, but followed only an uncertain opinion. They did not really kill him
4|158|but God took him up unto Himself: And God is mighty and wise
4|159|And there shall not be one of those who have received the scriptures, who shall not believe in him, before his death; and on the day of resurrection he shall be a witness against them
4|160|Because of the iniquity of those who judaize, we have forbidden them good things, which had been formerly allowed them; and because they shut out many from the way of God
4|161|and have taken usury, which was forbidden them by the law, and devoured men's substance vainly: We have prepared for such of them as are unbelievers a painful punishment
4|162|But those among them who are well grounded in knowledge, and the faithful, who believe in that which hath been sent down unto thee, and that which hath been sent down unto the prophets before thee, and who observe the stated times of prayer, and give alms, and believe in God and the last day; unto these will we give a great reward
4|163|Verily We have revealed our will unto thee, as We have revealed it unto Noah and the prophets who succeeded him; and as we revealed it unto Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and unto Jesus, and Job, and Jonas, and Aaron, and Solomon; and We have given thee the Koran, as We gave the psalms unto David
4|164|Some apostles have We sent, whom We have formerly mentioned unto thee, and other apostles have We sent, whom We have not mentioned unto thee; and God spake unto Moses, discoursing with him
4|165|apostles declaring good tidings, and denouncing threats, lest men should have an argument of excuse against God, after the apostles had been sent unto them; God is mighty and wise
4|166|God is witness of that revelation which He hath sent down unto thee; He sent it down with his special knowledge: The angels also are witnesses thereof; but God is a sufficient witness
4|167|They who believe not, and turn aside others from the way of God, have erred in a wide mistake
4|168|Verily those who believe not, and act unjustly, God will by no means forgive, neither will He direct them into any other way
4|169|than the way of hell; they shall remain therein for ever: And this is easy with God
4|170|O men, now is the apostle come unto you, with truth from your Lord; believe therefore, it will be better for you. But if ye disbelieve, verily unto God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; and God is knowing and wise
4|171|O ye who have received the scriptures, exceed not the just bounds in your religion, neither say of God any other than the truth. Verily Christ Jesus the son of Mary is the apostle of God, and his word, which he conveyed into Mary, and a spirit proceeding from him. Believe therefore in God, and his apostles, and say not, there are three Gods; forbear this; it will be better for you. God is but one God. Far be it from Him that He should have a son! Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; and God is a sufficient protector
4|172|Christ doth not proudly disdain to be a servant unto God; neither the angles who approach near to his presence: And whoso disdaineth his service, and is puffed up with pride, God will gather them all to Himself, on the last day
4|173|Unto those who believe, and do that which is right, He shall give their rewards, and shall superabundantly add unto them of his liberality: But those who are disdainful and proud, He will punish with a grievous punishment; and they shall not find any to protect or to help them, besides God
4|174|O men, now is an evident proof come unto you from your Lord, and We have sent down unto you manifest light
4|175|They who believe in God and firmly adhere to him, He will lead them into mercy from him, and abundance; and He will direct them in the right way to himself
4|176|They will consult thee for thy decision in certain cases; say unto them, God giveth you these determinations, concerning the more remote degrees of kindred. If a man die without issue, and have a sister; she shall have the half of what he shall leave: And he shall be heir to her, in case she have no issue. But if there be two sisters, they shall have between them two third parts of what he shall leave; and of there be several, both brothers and sisters, a male shall have as much as the portion of two females. God declareth unto you these precepts, lest ye err: And God knoweth all things
5|1|O true believers, perform your contracts. Ye are allowed to eat the brute cattle, other than what ye are commanded to abstain from, except the game which ye are allowed at other times, but not while ye are on pilgrimage to Mecca; God ordaineth that which He pleaseth
5|2|O true believers, violate not the holy rites of God, nor the sacred month, nor the offering, nor the ornaments hung thereon, nor those who are travelling to the holy house, seeking favour from their Lord, and to please Him. But when ye shall have finished your pilgrimage; then hunt. And let not the malice of some, in that they hindered you from entering the sacred temple, provoke you to transgress, by taking revenge on them in the sacred months. Assist one another according to justice and piety, but assist not one another in injustice and malice: Therefore fear God; for God is severe in punishing
5|3|Ye are forbidden to eat that which dieth of it self, and blood, and swine's flesh, and that on which the name of any besides God, hath been invocated; and that which hath been strangled, or killed by a blow, or by a fall, or by the horns of another beast, and that which hath been eaten by a wild beast, except what ye shall kill your selves; and that which hath been sacrificed unto idols. It is likewise unlawful for you to make division by casting lots with arrows. This is an impiety. On this day, wo be unto those who have apostatized from their religion; therefore fear not them, but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, and have completed my mercy upon you; and I have chosen for you Islam, to be your religion. But whosoever shall be driven by necessity through hunger, to eat of what we have forbidden, not designing to sin, surely God will be indulgent and merciful unto him
5|4|They will ask thee what is allowed them as lawful to eat? Answer, such things as are good are allowed you; and what ye shall teach animals of prey to catch, training them up for hunting after the manner of dogs, and teaching them according to the skill which God hath taught you. Eat therefore of that which they shall catch for you; and commemorate the name of God thereon; and fear God, for God is swift in taking an account
5|5|This day are ye allowed to eat such things as are good, and the food of those to whom the scriptures were given is also allowed as lawful unto you; and your food is allowed as lawful unto them. And ye are also allowed to marry free women that are believers, and also free women of those who have received the scriptures before you, when ye shall have assigned them their dower; living chastly with them, neither committing fornication, nor taking them for concubines. Whoever shall renounce the faith, his work shall be vain, and in the next life he shall be of those who perish
5|6|O true believers, when ye prepare your selves to pray, wash your faces, and your hands unto the elbows; and rub your heads, and your feet unto the ancles; and if ye be polluted by having lain with a woman, wash your selves all over. But if ye be sick, or on a journey, or any of you cometh from the privy, or if ye have touched women, and ye find no water, take fine clean sand, and rub your faces and your hands therewith; God would not put a difficulty upon you; but he desireth to purify you, and to complete his favour upon you, that ye may give thanks
5|7|Remember the favour of God towards you, and his covenant which he hath made with you, when ye said, we have heard, and will obey. Therefore fear God, for God knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
5|8|O true believers, observe justice when ye appear as witnesses before God, and let not hatred towards any induce you to do wrong: But act justly; this will approach nearer unto piety; and fear God, for God is fully acquainted with what ye do
5|9|God hath promised unto those who believe, and do that which is right, that they shall receive pardon and a great reward
5|10|But they who believe not, and accuse our signs of falsehood, they shall be the companions of hell
5|11|O true believers, remember God's favour towards you, when certain men designed to stretch forth their hands against you, but he restrained their hands from hurting you; therefore fear God, and in God let the faithful trust
5|12|God formerly accepted the covenant of the children of Israel, and we appointed out of them twelve leaders: And God said, verily I am with you: If ye observe prayer, and give alms, and believe in my apostles, and assist them, and lend unto God on good usury, I will surely expiate your evil deeds from you, and I will lead you into gardens, wherein rivers flow: But he among you who disbelieveth after this, erreth from the strait path
5|13|Wherefore because they have broken their covenant, we have cursed them, and hardened their hearts; they dislocate the words of the pentateuch from their places, and have forgotten part of what they were admonished; and thou wilt not cease to discover deceitful practices among them, except a few of them. But forgive them, and pardon them, for God loveth the beneficent
5|14|And from those who say, we are Christians, we have received their covenant; but they have forgotten part of what they were admonished; wherefore we have raised up enmity and hatred among them, till the day of resurrection; and God will then surely declare unto them what they have been doing
5|15|O ye who have received the scriptures, now is our apostle come unto you, to make manifest unto you many things which ye concealed in the scriptures; and to pass over many things. Now is light and a perspicuous book of revelations come unto you from God
5|16|Thereby will God direct him who shall follow his good pleasure, into the paths of peace; and shall lead them out of darkness into light, by his will, and shall direct them in the right way
5|17|They are infidels, who say, verily God is Christ the son of Mary. Say unto them, and who could obtain any thing from God to the contrary, if he pleased to destroy Christ the son of Mary, and his mother, and all those who are on the earth? For unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth, and whatsoever is contained between them; he createth what he pleaseth, and God is almighty
5|18|The Jews and the Christians say, we are the children of God, and his beloved. Answer, why therefore doth he punish you for your sins? Nay, but ye are men, of those whom he hath created. He forgiveth whom he pleaseth, and punisheth whom he pleaseth, and unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth, and of what is contained between them both; and unto him shall all things return
5|19|O ye who have received the scriptures, now is our apostle come unto you, declaring unto you the true religion, during the cessation of apostles, lest ye should say, there came unto us no bearer of good tidings, nor any warner: But now is a bearer of good tidings, and a warner come unto you; and God is almighty
5|20|Call to mind when Moses said unto his people, O my people, remember the favour of God towards you, since he hath appointed prophets among you, and constituted you kings, and bestowed on you what he hath given to no other nation in the world
5|21|O my people, enter the holy land, which God hath decreed you, and turn not your backs, lest ye be subverted and perish
5|22|They answered, O Moses, verily there are a gigantic people in the land; and we will by no means enter it, until they depart thence; but if they depart thence, then will we enter therein
5|23|And two men of those who feared God, unto whom God had been gracious, said, enter ye upon them suddenly by the gate of the city; and when ye shall have entered the same, ye shall surely be victorious: Therefore trust in God, if ye are true believers
5|24|They replied, O Moses, we will never enter the land, while they remain therein: Go therefore thou, and thy Lord, and fight; for we will sit here
5|25|Moses said, O Lord, surely I am not master of any except my self, and my brother; therefore make a distinction between us and the ungodly people
5|26|God answered, verily the land shall be forbidden them forty years; during which time they shall wander like men astonished in the earth; therefore be not thou solicitous for the ungodly people
5|27|Relate also unto them the history of the two sons of Adam, with truth. When they offered their offering, and it was accepted from one of them, and was not accepted from the other, Cain said to his brother, I will certainly kill thee. Abel answered, God only accepteth the offering of the pious
5|28|if thou stretchest forth thy hand against me, to slay me, I will not stretch forth my hand against thee, to slay thee; for I fear God the Lord of all creatures
5|29|I choose that thou shouldest bear my iniquity and thine own iniquity; and that thou become a companion of hell fire; for that is the reward of the unjust
5|30|But his soul suffered him to slay his brother, and he slew him; wherefore he became of the number of those who perish
5|31|And God sent a raven, which scratched the earth, to shew him how he should hide the shame of his brother, and he said, wo is me! Am I unable to be like this raven, that I may hide my brother's shame? And he became one of those who repent
5|32|Wherefore we commanded the children of Israel, that he who slayeth a soul, without adding thereto the murder of another soul, or without committing wickedness in the earth, shall be as if he had slain all mankind: But he who saveth a soul alive, shall be as if he had saved the lives of all mankind. Our apostles formerly came unto them, with evident miracles; then were many of them, after this, transgressors on the earth
5|33|But the recompense of those who fight against God and his apostle, and study to act corruptly in the earth, shall be, that they shall be slain, or crucified, or have their hands and their feet cut off on the opposite sides, or be banished the land. This shall be their disgrace in this world, and in the next world they shall suffer a grievous punishment
5|34|except those who shall repent, before ye prevail against them; for know that God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
5|35|O true believers, fear God, and earnestly desire a near conjunction with Him, and fight for his religion, that ye may be happy
5|36|Moreover they who believe not, although they had whatever is in the earth, and as much more withal, that they might therewith redeem themselves from punishment on the day of resurrection; it shall not be accepted from them, but they shall suffer a painful punishment
5|37|They shall desire to go forth from the fire, but they shall not go forth from it, and their punishment shall be permanent
5|38|If a man or a woman steal, cut off their hands, in retribution for that which they have committed; this is an exemplary punishment appointed by God; and God is mighty and wise
5|39|But whoever shall repent after his iniquity, and amend, verily God will be turned unto him, for God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
5|40|Dost thou not know that the kingdom of heaven and earth is God's? He punisheth whom he pleaseth, and he pardoneth whom he pleaseth; for God is almighty
5|41|O apostle, let not them grieve thee, who hasten to infidelity, either of those who say, we believe, with their mouths, but whose hearts believe not; or of the Jews, who hearken to a lie, and hearken to other people; who come not unto thee: They pervert the words of the law from their true places, and say, if this be brought unto you, receive it; but if it be not brought unto you, beware of receiving ought else; and in behalf of him whom God shall resolve to seduce , thou shalt not prevail with God at all. They whose hearts God shall not please to cleanse, shall suffer shame in this world, and a grievous punishment in the next
5|42|Who hearken to a lie, and eat that which is forbidden. But if they come unto thee for judgment, either judge between them, or leave them; and if thou leave them, they shall not hurt thee at all. But if thou undertake to judge, judge between them with equity; for God loveth those who observe justice
5|43|And how will they submit to thy decision, since they have the law, containing the judgment of God? Then will they turn their backs, after this; but those are not true believers
5|44|We have surely sent down the law, containing direction, and light: Thereby did the prophets, who professed the true religion, judge those who Judaized; and the doctors and priests also judged by the book of God, which had been committed to their custody; and they were witnesses thereof. Therefore fear not men, but fear me; neither sell my signs for a small price. And whoso judgeth not according to what God hath revealed, they are infidels
5|45|We have therein commanded them, that they should give life for life, and eye for eye, and nose for nose, and ear for ear, and tooth for tooth; and that wounds should also be punished by retaliation: But whoever should remit it as alms, it should be accepted as an atonement for him. And whoso judgeth not according to what God hath revealed, they are unjust
5|46|We also caused Jesus the son of Mary to follow the footsteps of the prophets, confirming the law which was sent down before him; and we gave him the gospel, containing direction and light; confirming also the law which was given before it, and a direction and admonition unto those who fear God
5|47|That they who have received the gospel might judge according to what God hath revealed therein: And whoso judgeth not according to what God hath revealed, they are transgressors
5|48|We have also sent down unto thee the book of the Koran with truth, confirming that scripture which was revealed before it; and preserving the same safe from corruption. Judge therefore between them according to that which God hath revealed; and follow not their desires, by swerving from the truth which hath come unto thee. Unto every of you have we given a law, and an open path; and if God had pleased, he had surely made you one people; but he hath thought fit to give you different laws, that he might try you in that which he hath given you respectively. Therefore strive to excel each other in good works: Unto God shall ye all return, and then will he declare unto you that concerning which ye have disagreed
5|49|Wherefore do thou, O prophet, judge between them according to that which God hath revealed and follow not their desires; but beware of them, lest they cause thee to err from part of those precepts which God hath sent down unto thee; and if they turn back, know that God is pleased to punish them for some of their crimes; for a great number of men are transgressors
5|50|Do they therefore desire the judgment of the time of ignorance? But who is better than God, to judge between people who reason aright
5|51|O true believers, take not the Jews, or Christians for your friends; they are friends the one to the other; but whoso among you taketh them for his friends, he is surely one of them: Verily God directeth not unjust people
5|52|Thou shalt see those in whose hearts there is an infirmity, to hasten unto them, saying, we fear lest some adversity befall us; but it is easy for God to give victory, or a command from Him, that they may repent of that which they concealed in their minds
5|53|And they who believe will say, are these the men who have sworn by God, with a most firm oath, that they surely held with you? Their works are become vain, and they are of those who perish
5|54|O true believers, whoever of you apostatizeth from his religion, God will certainly bring other people to supply his place, whom He will love, and who will love Him; who shall be humble towards the believers, but severe to the unbelievers: They shall fight for the religion of God, and shall not fear the obloquy of the detracter. This is the bounty of God, He bestoweth it on whom He pleaseth: God is extensive and wise
5|55|Verily your protector is God, and his apostle, and those who believe, who observe the stated times of prayer, and give alms, and who bow down to worship
5|56|And whoso taketh God, and his apostle, and the believers for his friends, they are the party of God, and they shall be victorious
5|57|O true believers, take not such of those to whom the scriptures were delivered before you, or of the infidels, for your friends, who make a laughingstock, and a jest of your religion; but fear God, if ye be true believers
5|58|nor those who, when ye call to prayer, make a laughing-stock and a jest of it, this they do, because they are people who do not understand
5|59|Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, do ye reject us for any other reason than because we believe in God, and that revelation which hath been sent down unto us, and that which was formerly sent down, and for that the greater part of you are transgressors
5|60|Say, shall I denounce unto you a worse thing than this, as to the reward which ye are to expect with God? He whom God hath cursed, and with whom he hath been angry, having changed some of them into apes and swine, and who worship Taghut, they are in the worse condition, and err more widely from the straitness of the path
5|61|When they came unto you, they said, we believe: Yet they entered into your company with infidelity, and went forth from you with the same; but God well knew what they concealed
5|62|Thou shalt see many of them hastening unto iniquity and malice, and to eat things forbidden; and woe unto them for what they have done
5|63|Unless their doctors and priests forbid them uttering wickedness, and eating things forbidden; woe unto them for what they shall have committed
5|64|The Jews say, the hand of God is tied up. Their hands shall be tied up, and they shall be cursed for that which they have said. Nay, his hands are both stretched forth; He bestoweth as He pleaseth: That which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord shall increase the transgression and infidelity of many of them; and we have put enmity and hatred between them, until the day of resurrection. So often as they shall kindle a fire for war, God shall extinguish it; and they shall set their minds to act corruptly in the earth, but God loveth not the corrupt doers
5|65|More, if they who have received the scriptures believe, and fear God, We will surely expiate their sins from them, and We will lead them into gardens of pleasure
5|66|and if they observe the law, and the gospel, and the other scriptures which have been sent down unto them from their Lord, they shall surely eat of good things both from above them, and from under their feet. Among them there are people who act uprightly; but how evil is that which many of them do work
5|67|O apostle, publish the whole of that which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord: For if thou do not, thou dost not in effect publish any part thereof; and God will defend thee against wicked men; for God directeth not the unbelieving people
5|68|Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, ye are not grounded on any thing, until ye observe the law and the gospel, and that which hath been sent down unto you from your Lord. That which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord shall surely increase the transgression and infidelity of many of them: But be not thou solicitous for the unbelieving people
5|69|Verily they who believe, and those who judaize, and the Sabians, and the Christians, whoever of them believeth in God and the last day, and doth that which is right, there shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
5|70|We formerly accepted the covenant of the children of Israel, and sent apostles unto them. So often as an apostle came unto them with that which their souls desired not, they accused some of them of imposture, and some of them they killed
5|71|And they imagined that there should be no punishment for those crimes, and they became blind, and deaf. Then was God turned unto them; afterwards many of them again became blind and deaf; but God saw what they did
5|72|They are surely infidels, who say, verily God is Christ the son of Mary; since Christ said, O children of Israel, serve God, my Lord and your Lord; whoever shall give a companion unto God, God shall exclude him from paradise, and his habitation shall be hell fire; and the ungodly shall have none to help them
5|73|They are certainly infidels, who say, God is the third of three: For there is no God, besides one God; and if they refrain not from what they say, a painful torment shall surely be inflicted on such of them as are unbelievers
5|74|Will they not therefore be turned unto God, and ask pardon of him? Since God is gracious and merciful
5|75|Christ, the son of Mary, is no more than an apostle; other apostles have preceded him; and his mother was a woman of veracity: They both eat food. Behold, how we declare unto them the signs of God's unity; and then behold, how they turn aside from the truth
5|76|Say unto them, will ye worship, besides God, that which can cause you neither harm nor profit? God is He who heareth and seeth
5|77|Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, exceed not the just bounds in your religion, by speaking beside the truth; neither follow the desires of peole who have heretofore erred, and who have seduced many, and have gone astray from the strait path
5|78|Those among the children of Israel who believed not, were cursed by the tongue of David, and of Jesus the son of Mary. This befell them because they were rebellious and transgressed
5|79|They forbade not one another the wickedness which they committed; and wo unto them for what they committed
5|80|Thou shalt see many of them take for their friends, those who believe not. Woe unto them for what their souls have sent before them, for that God is incensed against them, and they shall remain in torment for ever
5|81|But, if they had believed in God, and the prophet, and that which hath been revealed unto him, they had not taken them for their friends; but many of them are evil doers
5|82|Thou shalt surely find the most violent of all men in enmity against the true believers, to be the Jews, and the idolaters: And thou shalt surely find those among them to be the most inclinable to entertain friendship for the true believers, who say, we are Christians. This cometh to pass, because there are priests and monks among them; and because they are not elated with pride
5|83|And when they hear what has been revealed to this Messenger, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears, because of the truth which they have recognized. They say, 'Our Lord, we believe, so write us down among the witnesses
5|84|And why should we not believe in God and in the truth which has come to us, while we earnestly wish that our Lord should include us among the righteous people
5|85|So God rewarded them for what they said, with Gardens beneath which streams flow. Therein shall they abide: and that is the reward of those who do good
5|86|And those who have disbelieved and rejected Our Signs, these are they who are the inmates of Hell
5|87|O ye who believe! make not unlawful the good things which God has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Surely God loves not the transgressors
5|88|And eat of that which God has provided for you of what is lawful and good. And fear God in Whom you believe
5|89|God will not take you to task for such of your oaths as are vain, but He will take you to task for breaking the oaths which you take in earnest. The expiation thereof, then, is the feeding of ten poor persons with such average food as you feed your families with, or the clothing of them or the freeing of a slave. But whoso finds not the means shall fast for three days. That is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn. And keep your oaths. Thus does God explain to you His Signs that you may be grateful
5|90|O ye who believe! wine and the game of chance and idols and divining arrows are only the abomination of Satan's handiwork. So shun each one of them that you may prosper
5|91|Satan seeks only to create enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and the game of chance, and to keep you back from the remembrance of God and from Prayer. Then will you keep back
5|92|And obey God and obey the Messenger, and be on your guard. But if you turn away, then know that on Our Messenger lies only the clear conveyance of the Message
5|93|On those who believe and do good works there shall be no sin for what they eat, provided they fear God and believe and do good works, and again fear God and believe, yet again fear God and do good. And God loves those who do good
5|94|O ye who believe! God will surely try you in a little matter: the game which your hands and lances can reach, so that God may cause to be known those who fear Him in secret. Whoso, therefore, will transgress after this, shall have a grievous punishment
5|95|O ye who believe! kill not game while you are in a state of Pilgrimage. And whoso among you kills it intentionally, its compensation is a quadruped like unto that which he has killed, as determined by two just men from among you, the same to be bought as an offering to the Ka'bah; or as an expiation he shall feed a number of poor persons, or fast an equivalent number of days, so that he may taste the penalty of his deed. As for the past, God forgives it; but whoso reverts to it, God will punish him for his offence. And God is the Lord of retribution
5|96|The game of the sea and the eating thereof is made lawful for you as a provision for you and the travelers; but forbidden to you is the game of the land as long as you are in the state of Pilgrimage. And fear God to whom you shall be gathered
5|97|God has made the Ka'bah the Sacred House, a means of support and uplift for mankind, as also the Sacred Month and the offerings and the animals with collars. That is so that you may know that God knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and that God knows all things well
5|98|Know that God is Severe in punishment and that God is also Most Forgiving and ever Merciful
5|99|On the Messenger lies only the conveying of the Message. And God knows what you disclose and what you hide
5|100|Say, 'The bad and the good are not alike,' even though the abundance of bad may please thee. So be mindful of your duty to God, O men of understanding, that you may prosper
5|101|O ye who believe! ask not about things which, if revealed to you, would cause you trouble, though if you ask about them while the Qur'an is being sent down they will be revealed to you. God has left them out on purpose. And God is Most Forgiving and Forbearing
5|102|A people before you asked about such things, but then they became disbelievers therein
5|103|God has not ordained any 'Bahira' or 'Sa'ibah' or Wasilah' or 'Hami' but those who disbelieve forge a lie against God, and most of them do not make use of their understanding
5|104|And when it is said to them, 'Come to what God has revealed, and to the Messenger,' they say, 'Sufficient for us is that wherein we found our fathers.' What! even though their fathers had no knowledge and had no guidance
5|105|O ye who believe! take care of your own selves. He who goes astray cannot harm you when you yourselves are rightly guided. To God will you all return; then He will inform you of what you used do
5|106|O ye who believe! the right evidence among you, when death comes to one of you, at the time of making a will, is of two just men from among you; or of two others not from among you, in case you be journeying in the land and the calamity of death befalls you. You shall detain them both after Prayer for giving evidence; and if you have doubt concerning their evidence, they shall both swear by God, saying, 'We will not take for this any price, even though the person affected thereby be a near relation, nor will we hide the testimony enjoined by God; surely in that case we shall be among the sinners
5|107|But if it be discovered that the two witnesses are guilty of sin, then two others shall take their place from amongst those against whom the former two witnesses -- who were in a better position to give true evidence -- had deposed, and the two latter witnesses shall swear by God, saying, 'Surely our testimony is truer than the testimony of the former two, and we have not been unfair in any way; for then, indeed, we should be of the unjust
5|108|Thus it is more likely that they will give evidence according to facts or that they will fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths. And fear God and hearken. And God guides not the disobedient people
5|109|Think of the day when God will assemble the Messengers and say, 'What was the reply made to you?' They will say, 'We have no knowledge, it is only Thou Who art the Knower of hidden things
5|110|When God will say, 'O Jesus son of Mary, remember My favour upon thee and upon thy mother; When I strengthened thee with the spirit of holiness so that thou didst speak to the people in the cradle and when of middle age; and when I taught thee the Book and the wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when thou didst fashion a creation out of clay, in the likeness of a bird, by My command; then thou didst breathe into it a new spirit and it became a soaring being by My command; and thou didst heal the night-blind and the leprous by My command; and when thou didst raise the dead by My command; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from putting thee to death when thou didst come to them with clear Signs; and those who disbelieved from among them said, 'This is nothing but clear deception
5|111|And remember My favour when I inspired the disciples saying, 'Believe in Me and My Messenger,' they said, 'We believe and bear Thou witness that we have submitted
5|112|When the disciples said, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, is thy Lord able to send down to us a table spread with food from heaven? He said, 'Fear God, if you are believers
5|113|They said, 'We desire that we may eat of it, and that our hearts may be at rest and that we may know that thou hast spoken the truth to us, and that we may be witness thereto
5|114|Said Jesus, son of Mary, 'O God, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven spread with food that it may be to us a festival, to the first of us and to the last of us and a Sign from Thee; and provide sustenance for us, for Thou art the Best of Sustainers
5|115|God said, 'Surely I will send it down to you; but whosoever of you disbelieves afterwards -- I will surely punish them with a punishment wherewith I will not punish any other of the peoples
5|116|And when God will say, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, didst thou say to men, 'Take me and my mother for two gods beside God?' he will answer, 'Holy art Thou, I could never say that which I had no right. If I had said it, Thou wouldst have surely known it. Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy mind. It is Thou alone Who art the Knower of all hidden things
5|117|I said nothing to them except that which Thou didst command me -- Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I remained among them, but since Thou didst cause me to die, Thou, hast been the Watcher over them, and Thou art Witness over all things
5|118|If Thou punish them, they are Thy servants; and if Thou forgive them, Thou surely art the Mighty, the Wise
5|119|God will say, 'This is a day when only the truthful shall profit by their truthfulness. For them are Gardens beneath which streams flow; therein shall they abide forever. God is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him; that indeed is the supreme achievement
5|120|To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them; and He has power over all things
6|1|All praise belongs to God Who created the heavens and the earth and brought into being darkness and light; yet those who disbelieve set up equals to their Lord
6|2|He it is Who created you from clay and then He decreed a term. And there is another term fixed with Him. Yet you doubt
6|3|And He is God, the God, both in the heavens and in the earth. He knows what you disclose and your secrets. And He knows what you earn
6|4|And there comes not to them any Sign of the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it
6|5|So they rejected the truth when it came to them; but soon shall come to them the tidings of that at which they mocked
6|6|See they not how many a generation We have destroyed before them? We had established them in the earth as We have not established you and We sent the clouds over them, pouring down abundant rain; and We caused streams to flow beneath them; then did We destroy them because of their sins and raised up after them another generation
6|7|And if We had sent down to thee a writing upon the parchment and they had felt it with their hands even then the disbelievers would have surely said, 'This is nothing but manifest sorcery
6|8|And they say, 'Why has not an angel been sent down to him?' And if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided, and then they would have been granted no respite
6|9|And if We had appointed as Messenger an angel, We would have made him appear as a man; and thus We would have caused to be confused to them that which they are themselves confusing
6|10|And surely the Messengers have been mocked at before thee, but that which they mocked at encompassed those of them who scoffed at it
6|11|Say, 'Go about in the earth and see what was the end of those who treated the Prophets as liars
6|12|Say, 'To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?' Say, 'To God.' He has taken upon Himself to show mercy. He will certainly continue to assemble you till the Day of Resurrection. There is no doubt in it. Those who have ruined their souls will not believe
6|13|To Him belongs whatever exists in the darkness of the night and the light of the day. And He is All-Hearing, the All-Knowing
6|14|Say, 'Shall I take any protector other than God, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, Who feeds and is not fed?' Say, 'I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit.' And be thou not of those who associate partners with God
6|15|Say, 'Indeed I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of an awful day
6|16|He from whom it is averted on that day, God indeed has had mercy on him. And that indeed is a manifest achievement
6|17|And if God touch thee with affliction, there is none to remove it but He; and if He touch thee with happiness, then He has the power to do all that He wills
6|18|And He is supreme over His servants; and He is the Wise, the All-Aware
6|19|Say, 'What thing is the weightiest in testimony.' Say, 'God is a Witness between me and you. And this Qur'an has been revealed to me so that with it I may warn you, as well as whomsoever it reaches, of the impending punishment. What! do you really bear witness that there are other gods besides God?' Say, 'I bear not witness thereto.' Say, 'He is the One God, and certainly I am innocent of that which you associate with Him
6|20|Those to whom We gave the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons. But those who ruin their souls -- they will not believe
6|21|And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against God or treat His Signs as lies? Surely the unjust shall not prosper
6|22|And think of the day when We shall gather them all together; then shall We say to those who associated partners with God, 'Where are the partners you spoke of -- those whom you asserted
6|23|Then they will have no excuse save that they shall say, 'By God, our Lord, we were not idolaters
6|24|See how they shall lie against themselves. And that which they fabricated shall fail them
6|25|And among them are some who give ear to thee; but We have put veils on their hearts, that they should not understand, and deafness in their ears. And even if they see every Sign, they would not believe therein, so much so that when they come to thee, disputing with thee, those who disbelieve say, 'This is nothing but fables of the ancients
6|26|And they forbid others to believe in it and themselves too they keep away from it. And they ruin none but their ownselves; only they perceive not
6|27|And if thou couldst only see when they are made to stand before the Fire! They will say, 'Oh, would that we might be sent back! And then we would not treat the Signs of our Lord as lies and we would be of the believers
6|28|Nay, that which they used to hide before has now become clear to them. And if they were sent back, they would surely return to that which they are forbidden. And they are certainly liars
6|29|And they say, 'There is nothing except this our present life, and we shall not be raised again
6|30|And if thou couldst only see when they are made to stand before their Lord, He will say, 'Is not this second life the truth? They will say, 'Yea, by our Lord.' He will say, 'Then taste the punishment because you disbelieved
6|31|Those indeed are the losers who deny the meeting with God, so much so, that when the Hour shall come on them unawares, they will say, 'O our grief for our neglecting this Hour!' And they shall bear their burdens on their backs. Surely, evil is that which they bear
6|32|And the life of this world is nothing but a sport and pastime. And surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand
6|33|We know indeed that what they say grieves thee; for surely it is not thee that they charge with falsehood but it is the Signs of God that the evil-doers reject
6|34|And the Messengers indeed have been rejected before thee, but notwithstanding their rejection and persecution they remained patient until Our help came to them. There is none to change the words of God. And there have already come to thee some of the tidings of the past Messengers
6|35|And if their turning away is hard on thee, then, if thou art able to seek a passage into the earth or a ladder unto heaven and bring them a Sign, thou canst do so. And had God enforced His will, He could surely have brought them all together to the guidance. So be thou not of those who lack knowledge
6|36|Only those can accept the truth who listen. And as for the dead, God will raise them to life, then to Him shall they all be brought back
6|37|And they say, 'Why has not a Sign been sent down to him from his Lord?' Say, 'Surely God has the power to send down a Sign, but most of them do not know
6|38|There is not an animal that crawls in the earth, nor a bird that flies on its two wings, but they are communities like you. We have left out nothing in the Book. Then to their Lord shall they all be gathered together
6|39|Those who have rejected Our signs are deaf and dumb, in utter darkness. Whom God wills He lets go astray and whom He wills He places on the right path
6|40|Say,`Will you tell me if the punishment of God come or there come upon you the Hour, will you call upon any other than God, if you are truthful
6|41|Nay, but on Him alone will you call; then will He remove, if He pleases, that which you call on Him to remove, and you will forget what you associate with Him
6|42|And indeed We sent Messengers to peoples before thee; then We afflicted them with poverty and adversity that they might humble themselves
6|43|Why, then, when Our punishment came upon them, did they not humble themselves? But their hearts were hardened all the more and Satan made all that they did seem fair to them
6|44|When they forgot that with which they had been admonished, and We opened unto them the gates of all things, till, even as they were rejoicing in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and lo! they were in utter despair
6|45|So the last remnant of the people who did wrong was cut off; and all praise belongs to God, the Lord of all the worlds
6|46|Say, 'Will you tell me, if God should take away your hearing and your sight, and seal up your hearts, who is the god other than God who can bring it back to you?' See how We expound the Signs in various ways, yet they turn away
6|47|Say, 'Will you tell me, if the punishment of God come upon you suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed save the wrongdoing people
6|48|And We sent not the Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings and as Warners. So those who believe and reform themselves, on them shall come no fear nor shall they grieve
6|49|And those who reject our Signs, punishment will touch them, because they disobeyed
6|50|Say, 'I do not say to you: 'I possess the treasures of God, nor do I know the unseen; nor do I say to you: 'I am an angel, I follow only that which is revealed to me.' Say, 'Can a blind man and one who sees be alike?' Will you not then reflect
6|51|And warn thereby those who fear that they shall be gathered to their Lord that they shall have no friend nor intercessor besides Him, so that they may become righteous
6|52|And drive not away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. Thou art not at all accountable for them nor are they accountable for thee. So if thou shouldst drive them away thou wilt be of the unjust
6|53|And in the like manner have We tried some of them by others, that they may say, 'Is it these whom God has favoured from among us?' Does not God know best those who are grateful
6|54|And when those who believe in Our Signs come to thee, say; 'Peace be unto you! Your Lord has taken it upon Himself to show mercy, so that whoso among you does evil in ignorance and repents thereafter and reforms, then He is Most Forgiving and Merciful
6|55|And thus do We expound the Signs that the truth may become manifest and that the way of the sinners may become clear
6|56|Say, 'I am forbidden to worship those on whom you call besides God.' Say, 'I will not follow your low desires. In that case, I shall have gone astray and I shall not be of the rightly guided
6|57|Say, 'I take my stand on a clear evidence from my Lord and you reject it. That which you desire to be hastened is not in my power. The decision rest with God alone. He explains the truth and He is the Best of Judges
6|58|Say, 'If that which you desire to be hastened were in my power, surely the matter would have been decided between me and you. And God knows best the unjust
6|59|And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them but He. And He knows whatsoever is in the land and in the sea. And there falls not a leaf but He knows it; nor is there a grain in the deep darkness of the earth, nor anything green or dry, but it is recorded in a clear book
6|60|And He it is who takes your soul by night and knows what you do by day, then He raises you up again therein, that the appointed term may be completed. Then to Him is your return. Then will He inform you of what you used to do
6|61|And He is Supreme over His servants, and He sends guardians to watch over you, until, when death comes to anyone of you, Our Messengers take his soul, and they fail not
6|62|Then they are returned to God, their true Lord. Surely, His is the judgment. And He is the Swiftest of reckoners
6|63|Say, 'Who delivers you from the calamities of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him in humility and in secret, saying, 'If He deliver us from this, we will surely be of those who are grateful
6|64|Say, 'God delivers you from them and from every distress, yet you associate partners with Him
6|65|Say, 'He has the power to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet, or to confound you by splitting you into sects and make you taste the violence of one another. See how We expound the Signs in various ways that they may understand
6|66|And thy people have rejected it though it is the truth. Say, 'I am not a guardian over you
6|67|For every prophecy there is a fixed time; and soon will you come to know
6|68|And when thou seest those who engage in vain discourse concerning Our Signs, then turn thou away from them until they engage in a discourse other than that. And if Satan should cause thee to forget, then sit not, after recollection, with the unjust people
6|69|And those who are righteous are not at all accountable for them, but their duty is to admonish them that they may fear God
6|70|And leave alone those who take their religion to be a sport and a pastime, and whom worldly life has beguiled. And admonish people thereby lest a soul be consigned to perdition for what it has earned. It shall have no helper nor intercessor beside God; and even if it offer every ransom it shall not be accepted from it. These are they who have been delivered over to destruction for their own acts. They will have a drink of boiling water and a grievous punishment, because they disbelieved
6|71|Say, 'Shall we call beside God, upon that which can neither profit us nor harm us, and shall we be turn back on our heels after God guided us? -- Like one whom the evil ones entice away, leaving him bewildered in the land, and who has companions who call him to guidance, saying, 'Come to us.' Say : 'Surely, the guidance of God is the only true guidance and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds
6|72|And we have been given the command: Observe Prayers and fear Him;' and He it is Whom you shall all be gathered
6|73|And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom; and on the day when He will say, 'Be', it will be. His word is the truth, and His will be the Kingdom on the day when the trumpet will be blown. He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen. And He is the Wise, the All-Aware
6|74|And remember the time when Abraham said to his father, Azar, 'Dost thou take idols for gods? Surely, I see thee and thy people in manifest error
6|75|And thus did we show Abraham the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he should have full knowledge and that he might be of those who possess certainty of faith
6|76|And when the night darkened upon him, he saw a star. He said, 'Can this be my Lord?' But when it set, he said, I like not those that set
6|77|And when he saw the moon rise with spreading light, he said, 'Can this be my lord?' But when it set, he said, 'If my Lord guide me not, I shall surely be of the people who go astray
6|78|And when he saw the sun rise with spreading light, he said, 'Can this be my Lord? This is the greatest.' But when it also set, he said, 'O my people! surely I am quit of that which you associate with God
6|79|I have turned my face toward Him Who created the heavens and the earth, being ever inclined to God, and I am not of those who associate gods with Him
6|80|And his people argued with him. He said, 'Do you argue with me concerning God when He has guided me aright? And I fear not that which you associate with HIM' except that I fear what my Lord wills. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. Will you not them be admonished
6|81|And why should I fear that which you associate with God, when you fear not to associate with God that for which He has sent down to you no authority? Which, then, of the two parties has better title to security, If indeed you know
6|82|Those who belief and mix not up their belief with injustice -- it is they who shall have peace, and who are rightly guided
6|83|And that is Our argument which We gave to Abraham against his people. We exalt in decrees of rank whomso We please. Thy Lord is indeed Wise, All-Knowing
6|84|And We gave him Isaac and Jacob; each did We guide aright, and Noah did We guide aright aforetime, and of his progeny, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward those who do good
6|85|And We guided Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias; each one of them was of the righteous
6|86|And We also guided Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot! and each one of them did We exalt above the people
6|87|And We exalted some of their fathers and their children and their brethren, and We chose them and We guided them in the straight path
6|88|That is the guidance of God. He guides thereby those of His servants whom He pleases. And if they had worshiped aught beside Him, surely all they did would have been of no avail to them
6|89|It is to these whom We gave the Book and dominion and Prophethood. But if they are ungrateful for these favours it matters not, for We have now entrusted them to a people who are not ungrateful for them
6|90|These it is whom God guide aright, so follow thou their guidance. Say, 'I ask not of you any reward for it. This is naught but an admonition for all mankind
6|91|And they do not make a just estimate of the attributes of God, when they say, 'God has not revealed anything to any man. Say, 'Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and a guidance for the people -- though you treat it as scrapes of paper, some of which you show while you hide much thereof and you have been taught that which neither you nor your fathers knew?' Say, 'God.' Then leave them to amuse themselves with idle talk
6|92|And this is a Book which We have revealed, full of blessings, to fulfill that which preceded it, and to enable thee to warn the Mother of towns and those around her. And those, who believe in the Hereafter, believe therein and they strictly observe their Prayers
6|93|And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against God, or says, 'It has been revealed to me,' while nothing has been revealed to him; and who says, 'I will sent down the like of that which God has sent down?' And if thou couldst only see, when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, and the angels stretch forth their hands, saying, 'Yield up your souls. This day shall you be awarded the punishment of disgrace because of that which you spoke against God falsely and because you turned away from His Signs with disdain
6|94|And now you come to Us one by one even as We create you at first, and you have left behind your backs that which We bestowed upon you, and We do not see with you your intercessors of whom you asserted that they were partners with God in your affairs. Now you have been cut off from one another and that which you asserted has failed you
6|95|Verily, it is God Who causes the grain and the date-stones to sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead, and He is the Bringer forth of the dead from the living. That is God; wherefore, then, are you turned back
6|96|He causes the break of day and He made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for the reckoning of time. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise
6|97|And He it is Who has made the stars for you that you may follow the right direction with their help amid the darkness of the land and the sea. We have explained the Signs in detail for a people who possess knowledge
6|98|And He it is Who has produced you from a single soul and there is for you a temporary resort and a permanent abode. We have explained the Signs in detail for a people who understand
6|99|And He it is Who sends down water from the cloud; And We bring forth therewith every kind of growth; then We bring forth with that green foliage wherefrom We produce clustered grain. And from the date-palm, out of its sheaths comes forth bunches hanging low. And We produce therewith gardens of grapes, and the olive and the pomegranate -- like and unlike. Look at the fruit thereof when it bears fruit, and the ripening thereof. Surely, in this are Signs for a people who believe
6|100|And they hold the jinn to be partners with God, although He created them; and they falsely ascribe to Him sons and daughters without any knowledge. Holy is He and exalted far above what they attribute to Him
6|101|The Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He has no consort, and when He has created everything and has knowledge of all things
6|102|Such is God, your Lord. There is no god but He, the creator of all things; so worship Him. and He is the Guardian over everything
6|103|Eyes cannot reach Him but He reaches the eyes. And He is the incomprehensible, the All-Aware
6|104|Proofs have indeed come to you from your Lord; so whoever sees, it is for His own good; and whoever becomes blind, it is to his own loss. And I am not a guardian over you
6|105|And thus do We explain the Signs in various ways that the truth may become established and that they may say, 'Thou hast read out what thou hast learnt' and that We may explain it to a people who have no knowledge
6|106|Follow that which has been revealed to thee from thy Lord; there is no god but He; and turn aside from the idolaters
6|107|And if God had enforced His will, they would not have set up gods with Him. And We have not made thee a keeper over them, nor art thou over them a guardian
6|108|And abuse not those whom they call upon besides God, lest they, out of spite, abuse God in their ignorance. Thus unto every people have We caused their doings to seem fair. Then unto their Lord is their return; And He will inform them of what they used to do
6|109|And they swear by God their strongest oaths that if there came to them a Sign, they would surely believe therein. Say, 'Surely, Signs are with God. And what should make you know that when the signs come, they will not believe
6|110|And We shall confound their hearts and their eyes, for they believe not therein the first time, and We shall leave them in their transgression to wander in distraction
6|111|And though We had sent down angels unto them, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together before them all things in one view; they would not have believed, unless God had so pleased: But the greater part of them know it not
6|112|Thus have We appointed unto every prophet an enemy; the devils of men, and of genii: Who privately suggest the one to the other specious discourses to deceive; but if thy Lord pleased, they would not have done it. Therefore leave them, and that which they have falsely imagined
6|113|and let the hearts of those be inclined thereto, who believe not in the life to come; and let them please themselves therein, and let them gain that which they are gaining
6|114|Shall I seek after any other judge besides God to judge between us? It is He who hath sent down unto you the book of the Koran distinguishing between good and evil; and they to whom We gave the scripture know that it is sent down from thy Lord, with truth. Be not therefore one of those who doubt thereof
6|115|The words of thy Lord are perfect, in truth and justice; there is none who can change his words: He both heareth and knoweth
6|116|But if thou obey the greater part of them who are in the earth, they will lead thee aside from the path of God: They follow an uncertain opinion only, and speak nothing but lies
6|117|verily thy Lord well knoweth those who go astray from his path, and well knoweth those who are rightly directed
6|118|Eat of that whereon the name of God hath been commemorated, if ye believe in his signs
6|119|And why do ye not eat of that whereon the name of God hath been commemorated? Since He hath plainly declared unto you what He had forbidden you; except that which ye be compelled to by necessity eat of: Many lead others into error, because of their appetites, being void of knowledge; but thy Lord well knoweth who are the transgressors
6|120|Leave both the outside of iniquity, and the inside thereof: For they who commit iniquity shall receive the reward of that which they shall have gained
6|121|Eat not therefore of that whereon the name of God hath not been commemorated; for this is certainly wickedness: But the devils will suggest unto their friends, that they dispute with you concerning this precept; but if ye obey them, ye are surely idolaters
6|122|Shall he who hath been dead, and whom We have restored unto life, and unto whom We have ordained a light, whereby he may walk among men, be as he whose similitude is in darkness, from whence he shall not come forth? Thus was that which the infidels are doing, prepared for them
6|123|And thus have we placed in every city chief leaders of the wicked men thereof, that they may act deceitfully therein; but they shall act deceitfully against their own souls only; and they know it not
6|124|And when a sign cometh unto them, they say, we will by no means believe until a revelation be brought unto us, like unto that which hath been delivered unto the messengers of God. God best knoweth whom He will appoint for his messenger. Vileness in the sight of God shall fall upon those who deal wickedly, and a grievous punishment, for that they have dealt deceitfully
6|125|And whomsoever God shall please to direct, He will open his breast to receive the faith of Islam: But whomsoever He shall please to lead into error, He will render his breast strait and narrow, as though he were climbing up to heaven. Thus doth God inflict a terrible punishment on those who believe not
6|126|This is the right way of thy Lord. Now have We plainly declared our signs unto those people who will consider
6|127|They shall have a dwelling of peace with their Lord, and He shall be their patron, because of that which they have wrought
6|128|Think on the day whereon God shall gather them all together, and shall say, O company of genii, ye have been much concerned with mankind; and their friends from among mankind shall say, O Lord, the one of us hath received advantage from the other, and we are arrived at our limited term which Thou hast appointed us. God will say, hell fire shall be your habitation, therein shall ye remain for ever; unless as God shall please to mitigate your pains, for thy Lord is wise and knowing
6|129|Thus do We set some of the unjust over others of them, because of that which they have deserved
6|130|O company of genii and men, did not messengers from among your selves come unto you, rehearsing my signs unto you, and forewarning you of the meeting of this your day? They shall answer, we bear witness against our selves: The present life deceived them: And they shall bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers
6|131|This hath been the method of God's dealing with his creatures, because thy Lord would not destroy the cities in their iniquity, while their inhabitants were careless
6|132|Every one shall have degrees of recompense of that which they shall do; for thy Lord is not regardless of that which they do
6|133|and thy Lord is self-sufficient and indued with mercy. If He pleaseth He can destroy you, and cause such as He pleaseth to succeed you, in like manner as He produced you from the posterity of other people
6|134|Verily that which is threatened you, shall surely come to pass; neither shall ye cause it to fail
6|135|Say unto those of Mecca, O my people, act according to your power; verily I will act according to my duty: And hereafter shall ye know whose will be the reward of paradise. The ungodly shall not prosper
6|136|Those of Mecca set apart unto God a portion of that which he hath produced of the fruits of the earth, and of cattle; and say, this belongeth unto God, -- according to their imaginations, -- and this unto our companions. And that which is destined for their companions cometh not unto God; yet that which is set apart unto God cometh unto their companions. How ill do they judge
6|137|In like manner have their companions induced many of the idolaters to slay their children, that they might bring them to perdition, and that they might render their religion obscure and confused unto them. But if God had pleased, they had not done this: Therefore leave them, and that which they falsely imagine
6|138|They also say, these cattle and fruits of the earth are sacred; none shall eat thereof but who we please, -- according to their imagination; -- and there are cattle whose backs are forbidden to be rode on, or loaden with burdens; and there are cattle on which they commemorate not the name of God when they slay them, devising a lie against him: God shall reward them for that which they falsely devise
6|139|And they say, that which is in the bellies of these cattle, is allowed our males to eat, and is forbidden to our wives: But if it prove abortive, then they are both partakers thereof. God shall give them the reward of their attributing these things to him: He is knowing and wise
6|140|They are utterly lost who have slain their children foolishly, without knowledge; and have forbidden that which God hath given them for food, devising a lie against God. They have erred, and were not rightly directed
6|141|He it is who produceth gardens of vines, both those which are supported on trails of wood, and those which are not supported, and palm-trees, and the corn affording various food, and olives, and pomegranates, alike and unlike unto one another. Eat of their fruit, when they bear fruit, and pay the due thereof on the day whereon ye shall gather it; but be not profuse, for God loveth not those who are too profuse
6|142|And God hath given you some cattle fit for bearing of burdens, and some fit for slaughter only. Eat of what God hath given you for food; and follow not the steps of Satan, for he is your declared enemy
6|143|Four pair of cattle hath God given you; of sheep one pair, and of goats one pair. Say unto them, hath God forbidden the two males, of sheep and of goats, or the two females; or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Tell me with certainty, if ye speak truth
6|144|And of camels hath God given you one pair, and of oxen one pair. Say, hath He forbidden the two males of these, or the two females; or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Were ye present when God commanded you this? And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie against God, that he may seduce men without understanding? Verily God directeth not unjust people
6|145|Say, I find not in that which hath been revealed unto me, any thing forbidden unto the eater, that he eat it not, except it be that which dieth of it self, or blood poured forth, or swine's flesh: For this is an abomination: Or that which is profane, having been slain in the name of some other than of God. But whoso shall be compelled by necessity to eat of these things, not lusting, nor wilfully transgressing, verily thy Lord will be gracious unto him and merciful
6|146|Unto the Jews did We forbid every beast having an undivided hoof; and of bullocks and sheep, We forbade them the fat of both; except that which should be on their backs, or their inwards, or which should be intermixed with the bone. This have We rewarded them with, because of their iniquity; and We are surely speakers of truth
6|147|If they accuse thee of imposture, say, your Lord is indued with extensive mercy; but his severity shall not be averted from wicked people
6|148|The idolaters will say, if God had pleased, we had not been guilty of idolatry, neither our fathers; and pretend that We have not forbidden them any thing. Thus did they who were before them accuse the prophets of imposture, until they tasted our severe punishment. Say, is there with you any certain knowledge of what ye alledge, that ye may produce it unto us? Ye follow only a false imagination; and ye only utter lies
6|149|Say, therefore unto God belongeth the most evident demonstration; for if he had pleased, he had directed you all
6|150|Say, produce your witnesses, who can bear testimony that God hath forbidden this. But if they bear testimony of this, do not thou bear testimony with them, nor do thou follow the desires of those who accuse our signs of falsehood, and who believe not in the life to come, and equalize idols with their Lord
6|151|Say, come; I will rehearse that which your Lord hath forbidden you; that is to say, that ye be not guilty of idolatry, and that ye shew kindness to your parents, and that ye murder not your children for fear lest ye be reduced to poverty: We will provide for you and them; and draw not near unto hainous crimes, neither openly nor in secret; and slay not the soul which God hath forbidden you to slay, unless for a just cause. This hath He injoined you that ye may understand
6|152|And meddle not with the substance of the orphan, otherwise than for the improving thereof, until he attain his age of strength; and use a full measure, and a just balance. We will not impose a task on any soul, beyond its ability. And when ye pronounce judgement observe justice, although it be for or against one who is near of kin, and fulfill the covenant of God. This hath God commanded you, that ye may be admonished
6|153|and that ye may know that this is my right way: Therefore follow it, and follow not the paths of others, lest ye be scattered from the path of God. This hath He commanded you that ye may take heed
6|154|We gave also unto Moses the book of the Law; a perfect rule unto him who should do right, and a determination concerning all things needful, and a direction and mercy; that the children of Israel might believe the meeting of their Lord
6|155|And this book which We have now sent down, is blessed; therefore follow it and fear God that ye may obtain mercy
6|156|Lest ye should say, the scriptures were only sent down unto two people before us; and we neglected to peruse them with attention
6|157|Or lest ye should say, if a book of divine revelations had been sent down unto us, we would surely have better directed than they. And now hath a manifest declaration come unto you from your Lord, and a direction and mercy: And who is more unjust than he who deviseth lies against the signs of God, and turneth aside from them? We will reward those who turn aside from our signs with a grievous punishment, because they have turned aside
6|158|Do they wait for any other than that the angels should come unto them, to part their souls from their bodies; or that thy Lord should come to punish them; or that some of the signs of thy Lord should come to pass, shewing the day of judgement to be at hand? On the day whereon some of thy Lord's signs shall come to pass, its faith shall not profit a soul which believed not before, or wrought not good in its faith. Say, wait ye for this day; we surely do wait for it
6|159|They who make a division in their religion, and become sectaries, have thou nothing to do with them; their affair belongeth only unto God. Hereafter shall He declare unto them that which they have done
6|160|He who shall appear with good works, shall receive a tenfold recompense for the same; but he who shall appear with evil works, shall receive only an equal punishment for the same; and they shall not be treated unjustly
6|161|Say, verily my Lord hath directed me into a right way, a true religion, the sect of Abraham the orthodox; and he was no idolater
6|162|Say, verily my prayers, and my worship, and my life, and my death are dedicated unto God, the Lord of all creatures
6|163|He hath no companion. This have I been commanded: I am the first Moslem
6|164|Say, shall I desire any other Lord besides God? Since He is the Lord of all things; and no soul shall acquire any merits or demerits but for itself; and no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another. Moreover unto your Lord shall ye return; and He shall declare unto you that concerning which ye now dispute
6|165|It is He who hath appointed you to succeed your predecessors in the earth, and hath raised some of you above others by various degrees of worldly advantages, that He might prove you by that which He hath bestowed on you. Thy Lord is swift in punishing; and He is also gracious and merciful
7|1|S
7|2|A book hath been sent down unto thee: And therefore let there be no doubt in thy breast concerning it; that thou mayest preach the same, and that it may be an admonition unto the faithful
7|3|Follow that which hath been sent down unto you from your Lord; and follow no guides besides Him: How little will ye be warned
7|4|How many cities have We destroyed; which our vengeance overtook by night, or while they were reposing themselves at noon-day
7|5|And their supplication, when our punishment came upon them, was no other than that they said, verily we have been unjust
7|6|We will surely call those to an account, unto whom a prophet hath been sent; and We will also call those to account who have been sent unto them
7|7|And We will declare their actions unto them with knowledge; for We are not absent from them
7|8|The weighing of mens actions on that day shall be just; and they whose balances laden with their good works shall be heavy, are those who shall be happy
7|9|but they whose balances shall be light, are those who have lost their souls, because they injured our signs
7|10|And now have We placed you on the earth, and have provided you food therein: But how little are ye thankful
7|11|We created you, and afterwards formed you; and then said unto the angels, worship Adam; and they all worshipped him, except Eblis, who was not one of those who worshipped
7|12|God said unto him, what hindered thee from worshipping Adam, since I had commanded thee? He answered, I am more excellent than he: Thou hast created me of fire, and hast created him of clay
7|13|God said, get thee down therefore from paradise; for it is not fit that thou behave thy self proudly therein: Get thee hence; thou shalt be one of the contemptible
7|14|He answered, give me respite until the day of resurrection
7|15|God said, verily thou shalt be one of those who are respited
7|16|The devil said, because thou hast depraved me, I will lay wait for men in thy strait way
7|17|then will I come upon them from before, and from behind, and from their right hands, and from their left; and thou shalt not find the greater part of them thankful
7|18|God said unto him, get thee hence, despised, and driven far away: Verily whoever of them shall follow thee, I will surely fill hell with you all
7|19|But as for thee, O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in paradise; and eat of the fruit thereof where-ever ye will; but approach not this tree, lest ye become of the number of the unjust
7|20|And Satan suggested to them both, that he would discover unto them their nakedness, which was hidden from them; and he said, your Lord hath not forbidden you this tree, for any other reason but lest ye should become angels, or lest ye become immortal
7|21|And he sware unto them, saying, verily I am one of those who counsel you aright
7|22|And he caused them to fall through deceit. And when they had tasted of the tree, their nakedness appeared unto them; and they began to join together the leaves of paradise, to cover themselves. And their Lord called to them, saying, did I not forbid you this tree; and did I not say unto you, verily Satan is your declared enemy
7|23|They answered, O Lord, we have dealt unjustly with our own souls; and if thou forgive us not, and be not merciful unto us, we shall surely be of those who perish
7|24|God said, get ye down, the one of you an enemy unto the other; and ye shall have a dwelling place upon earth, and a provision for a season
7|25|He said, therein shall ye live, and therein shall ye die, and from thence shall ye be taken forth at the resurrection
7|26|O children of Adam, we have sent down unto you apparel, to conceal your nakedness, and fair garments; but the cloathing of piety is better. This is one of the signs of God; that peradventure ye may consider
7|27|O children of Adam, let not Satan seduce you, as he expelled your parents out of paradise, by stripping them of their cloathing, that he might shew them their nakedness: Verily he seeth you, both he and his companions, whereas ye see not them. We have appointed the devils to be the patrons of those who believe not
7|28|And when they commit a filthy action, they say, we found our fathers practising the same; and God hath commanded us to do it. Say, verily God commandeth not filthy actions. Do ye speak concerning God that which ye know not
7|29|Say, my Lord hath commanded me to observe justice; therefore set your faces to pray at every place of worship, and call upon Him, approving unto Him the sincerity of your religion. As He produced you at first, so unto Him shall ye return
7|30|A part of mankind hath He directed; and a part hath been justly led into error, because they have taken the devils for their patrons besides God, and imagine that they are rightly directed
7|31|O children of Adam, take your decent apparel at every place of worship, and eat and drink, but be not guilty of excess; for He loveth not those who are guilty of excess
7|32|Say, who hath forbidden the decent apparel of God, which He hath produced for his servants, and the good things which He hath provided for food? Say, these things are for those who believe, in this present life, but peculiarly on the day of resurrection. Thus do We distinctly explain our signs unto people who understand
7|33|Say, verily my Lord hath forbidden filthy actions, both that which is discovered thereof, and that which is concealed, and also iniquity, and unjust violence; and hath forbidden you to associate with God that concerning which he hath sent you down no authority, or to speak of God that which ye know not
7|34|Unto every nation there is a predixed term; therefore when their term is expired, they shall not have respite for an hour, neither shall they be anticipated
7|35|O children of Adam, verily apostles from among you shall come unto you, who shall expound my signs unto you: Whosoever therefore shall fear God and amend, there shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
7|36|But they who shall accuse our signs of falsehood, and shall proudly reject them, they shall be the companions of hell fire; they shall remain therein for ever
7|37|And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie concerning God, or accuseth his signs of imposture? Unto these shall be given their portion of worldly happiness, according to what is written in the book of God's decrees, until our messengers come unto them, and shall cause them to die; saying, where are the idols which ye called upon, besides God? They shall answer, they have disappeared from us. And they shall bear witness against themselves, that they were unbelievers
7|38|God shall say unto them at the resurrection, enter ye with the nations which have preceded you, of genii and of men, into hell fire: So often as one nation shall enter, it shall curse its sister, until they shall all have successively entered therein. The latter of them shall say of the former of them, O Lord, these have seduced us; therefore inflict on them a double punishment of the fire of hell. God shall answer, it shall be doubled unto all; but ye know it not
7|39|And the former of them shall say unto the latter of them, ye have not therefore any favour above us; taste the punishment for that which ye have gained
7|40|Verily they who shall charge our signs with falsehood, and shall proudly reject them, the gates of heaven shall not be opened unto them, neither shall they enter into paradise, until a camel pass through the eye of a needle; and thus will we reward the wicked doers
7|41|Their couch shall be in hell, and over them shall be coverings of fire; and thus will we reward the unjust
7|42|But they who believe, and do that which is right, -- we will not load any soul but according to its ability, -- they shall be the companions of paradise; they shall remain therein for ever
7|43|And we will remove all grudges from their minds; rivers shall run at their feet, and they shall say, praised be God, who hath directed us unto this felicity! For we should not have been rightly directed, if God had not directed us: Now are we convinced by demonstration that the apostles of our Lord came unto us with truth. And it shall be proclaimed unto them, this is paradise, whereof ye are made heirs, as a reward for that which ye have wrought
7|44|And the inhabitants of paradise shall call out to the inhabitants of hell fire, saying, now have we found that which our Lord promised us, to be true: Have ye also found that which your Lord promised you, to be true? They shall answer, yea. And a cryer shall proclaim between them, the curse of God shall be on the wicked
7|45|who turn men aside from the way of God, and seek to render it crooked, and who deny the life to come
7|46|And between the blessed and the damned there shall be a vail; and men shall stand on Al Araf, who shall know every one of them by their marks; and shall call unto the inhabitants of paradise, saying, peace be upon you: Yet they shall not enter therein, although they earnestly desire it
7|47|And when they shall turn their eyes towards the companions of hell fire, they shall say, O Lord, place us not with the ungodly people
7|48|And those who stand on Al Araf shall call unto certain men, whom they shall know by their marks, and shall say, what hath your gathering of riches availed you, and that ye were puffed up with pride
7|49|Are these the men on whom ye sware that God would not bestow mercy? Enter ye into paradise; there shall come no fear on you, neither shall ye be grieved
7|50|And the inhabitants of hell fire shall call unto the inhabitants of paradise, saying, pour upon us some water, or of those refreshments which God hath bestowed on you. They shall answer, verily God hath forbidden them unto the unbelievers
7|51|who made a laughing-stock and a sport of their religion, and whom the life of the world hath deceived: Therefore this day will we forget them, as they did forget the meeting of this day, and for that they denied our signs to be from God
7|52|And now have we brought unto those of Mecca a book of divine revelations: We have explained it with knowledge; a direction and mercy unto people who shall believe
7|53|Do they wait for any other than the interpretation thereof? On the day whereon the interpretation thereof shall come, they who had forgotten the same before, shall say, now are we convinced by demonstration that the messengers of our Lord came unto us with truth: Shall we therefore have any intercessors, who will intercede for us? Or shall we be sent back into the world, that we may do other works than what we did in our life-time? But now have they lost their souls; and that which they impiously imagined, hath fled from them
7|54|Verily your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days; and then ascended his throne: He causeth the night to cover the day; it succeedeth the same swiftly: He also created the sun and the moon, and the stars, which are absolutly subject unto his command. Is not the whole creation, and the empire thereof, his? Blessed be God, the Lord of all creatures
7|55|Call upon your Lord humbly and in secret; for He loveth not those who transgress
7|56|And act not corruptly in the earth, after its reformation; and call upon Him with fear and desire: For the mercy of God is near unto the righteous
7|57|It is He who sendeth the winds, spread abroad before his mercy, until they bring a cloud heavy with rain, which We drive unto a dead country; and We cause water to descend thereon, by which We cause all sorts of fruits to spring forth. Thus will We bring forth the dead from their graves; that peradventure ye may consider
7|58|From a good country shall its fruit spring forth abundantly, by the permission of its Lord; but from the land which is bad, it shall not spring forth otherwise than scarcely. Thus do We explain the signs of divine providence unto people who are thankful
7|59|We formerly sent Noah unto his people: And he said, O my people, worship God: Ye have no other God than Him. Verily I fear for you the punishment of the great day
7|60|The chiefs of his people answered Him, we surely perceive thee to be in a manifest error
7|61|He replied, O my people, there is no error in me; but I am a messenger from the Lord of all creatures
7|62|I bring unto you the messages of my Lord; and I counsel you aright: For I know from God, that which ye know not
7|63|Do ye wonder that an admonotion hath come unto your from your Lord by a man from among you, to warn you, that ye may take heed to yourselves, and that peradventure ye may obtain mercy
7|64|And they accused him of imposture: But We delivered him and those who were with him in the ark, and We drowned those who charged our signs with falsehood; for they were a blind people
7|65|And unto the tribe of Ad We sent their brother Hud. He said, O my people worship God: Ye have no other God than Him; will ye not fear Him
7|66|The chiefs of those among his people who believed not, answered, Verily we perceive that thou art guided by folly; and we certainly esteem thee to be one of the liars
7|67|He replied, O my people, I am not guided by folly; but I am a messenger unto you from the Lord of all creatures
7|68|I bring unto you the messages of my Lord; and I am a faithful counsellor unto you
7|69|Do ye wonder that an admonition hath come unto you from your Lord, by a man from among you, that he may warn you? Call to mind how He hath appointed you successors unto the people of Noah, and hath added unto you in stature largely. Remember the benefits of God, that ye may prosper
7|70|They said, art thou come unto us, that we should worship God alone, and leave the deities which our fathers worshipped? Now bring down that judgement upon us, with which thou threatenest us, if thou speakest truth
7|71|Hud answered, now shall there suddenly fall upon you from your Lord vengeance and indignation. Will ye dispute with me concerning the names which ye have named, and your fathers; as to which God hath not revealed unto you any authority? Do ye wait therefore, and I will be one of those who wait with you
7|72|And We delivered him, and them who believed with him, by our mercy; and We cut off the uttermost part of those who charged our signs with falsehood, and were not believers
7|73|And unto the tribe of Thamud We sent their brother Saleh. He said O my people, worship God: Ye have no God besides Him. Now hath a manifest proof come unto you from your Lord. This she-camel of God is a sign unto you: Therefore dismiss her freely, that she may feed in God's earth; and do her no hurt, lest a painful punishment seize you
7|74|And call to mind how He hath appointed you successors unto the tribe of Ad, and hath given you a habitation on earth; ye build yourselves castles on the plains thereof, and cut out the mountains into houses. Remember therefore the benefits of God, and commit not violence in the earth, acting corruptly
7|75|The chiefs among his people who were puffed up with pride, said unto those who were esteemed weak, namely, unto those who believed among them, do ye know that Saleh hath been sent from his Lord? They answered, we do surely believe in that wherewith he hath been sent
7|76|Those who were elated with pride replied, verily we believe not in that wherein ye believe
7|77|And they cut off the feet of the camel, and insolently transgressed the command of their Lord, and said, oh, cause that to come upon us, with which thou hast threatened us, if thou art one of those who have been sent by God
7|78|Whereupon a terrible noise from heaven assailed them; and in the morning they were found in their dwellings prostrate on their breasts and dead
7|79|And Saleh departed from them, and said, O my people, now have I delivered unto you the message of my Lord; and I advised you well, but ye love not those who advise you well
7|80|And remember Lot, when he said unto his people, do ye commit a wickedness, wherein no creature hath set you an example
7|81|Do ye approach lustfully unto men, leaving the women? Certainly ye are people who transgress all modesty
7|82|But the answer of his people was no other than that they said the one to the other, expel them from your city; for they are men who preserve themselves pure from the crimes which ye commit
7|83|Therefore We delivered him and his family, except his wife; she was one of those who stayed behind
7|84|And we rained a shower of stones upon them. Behold therefore what was the end of the wicked
7|85|And unto Madian we sent their brother Shoaib. He said unto them, O my people, worship God; ye have no God besides Him. Now hath an evident demonstration come unto you from your Lord. Therefore give full measure and just weight, and diminish not unto men ought of their matters; neither act corruptly in the earth, after its reformation. This will be better for you, if ye believe
7|86|And beset not every way, threatening the passenger; and turning aside from the path of God him who believeth in Him, and seeking to make it crooked. And remember, when ye were few, and God multiplied you: And behold, what hath been the end of those who acted corruptly
7|87|And if part of you believe in that wherewith I am sent, and part believe not, wait patiently until God judge between us; for He is the best judge
7|88|The chief men of his people who were arrogant said, 'Assuredly we will drive thee out, O Shu'aib, and the believers that are with thee from our town, or you shall return to our religion.' He said, 'Even though we be unwilling
7|89|If we return to your religion after God has saved us therefrom, we would indeed admit that we had been forging a lie against God. And it behoves us not to return thereto except that God, our Lord, should so will. Our Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. In God have we put our trust. So, Our Lord, decide Thou between us and between our people with truth and Thou art the Best of those who decide
7|90|And the chief men of his people, who disbelieved, said, 'If you follow Shu'aib, you shall then certainly be of the losers
7|91|So the earthquake seized them and in their homes they lay prostrate upon the ground
7|92|Those who accused Shu'aib of lying became as if they had never dwelt therein. Those who accused Shu'aib of lying -- it was they who were the losers
7|93|Then he turned away from them and said, 'O my people, indeed I delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you sincere counsel, How then should I sorrow for a disbelieving people
7|94|And never did We send a Prophet to any town but We did seize its people with adversity and suffering, that they might humble themselves
7|95|The We changed their evil condition to good until they grew in affluence and numbers and said, 'Suffering and happiness betided our fathers also, what if they befell us.' Then We seized them suddenly, while they perceive not
7|96|And if the people of those towns had believed and been righteous, We would have surely opened for them blessings from heaven and earth; but they disbelieved, so We seized them because of that which they earned
7|97|Are the people of these towns then secure from the coming of Our punishment upon them by night while they are asleep
7|98|And are the people of these towns secure from the coming of Our punishment upon them in the early part of the forenoon while they play
7|99|Are they then secure from the design of God? And none feels secure from the design of God save the people who are destined to perish
7|100|Does it not lead those, who have inherited the earth in succession to its former inhabitants, to realize that if We please, We can smite them also for their sins and seal up their hearts, so that they would not listen to words of guidance
7|101|Such were the towns some of whose news We have related to thee. And verily the Messengers came to them with clear Signs. But they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus does God seal up the hearts of the disbelievers
7|102|And We found not in most of them any observance of covenant and, surely, We found most of them to be evil-doers
7|103|Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they unjustly rejected them. Behold, then, what was the end of those who created disorder
7|104|And Moses said, 'O Pharaoh, surely, I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds
7|105|It is not right that I should say anything of God except the truth. I have come to you with a clear Sign from your Lord; therefore, let the children of Israel go with me
7|106|Pharaoh replied, 'If thou hast indeed come with a Sign, then produce it, if thou art truthful
7|107|So he flung his rod and behold! it was a serpent plainly visible
7|108|And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it appeared white to the beholders
7|109|The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, 'This is most surely a skillful sorcerer
7|110|He desires to turn you out from your land. Now what do you advise
7|111|They said, 'Put him off and his brother awhile, and send into the city summoners
7|112|Who should bring to thee every skillful sorcerer
7|113|And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh and said: 'We shall, of course, have a reward, if we prevail
7|114|He said, 'Yes, and you shall also be of those who are placed near to me
7|115|They said, 'O Moses, wilt thou throw first or shall we be the first throwers
7|116|He replied, 'Throw ye.' And when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck them with awe and produced a mighty magic
7|117|And We revealed to Moses: 'Throw thy rod,' and lo! it swallowed up whatever they feigned
7|118|So was the truth established and whatever they did, proved vain
7|119|Thus were they vanquished there and they retired humiliated
7|120|And the sorcerers were impelled to fall down prostrate
7|121|And they said, 'We believe in the Lord of the worlds
7|122|The Lord of Moses and Aaron
7|123|Pharaoh said, 'You have believed in him before I gave you leave. Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city, that you may turn out therefrom its inhabitants, but you shall soon know the consequences
7|124|Most surely will I cut off your hands and your feet on account of your disobedience. Then will I surely crucify you all together
7|125|They answered, 'To our Lord then shall we return
7|126|And thou does not wreck vengeance on us but because we have believed in the Signs of our Lord, when they came to us. Our Lord, pour forth upon us steadfastness and cause us to die resigned unto Thee
7|127|And the chiefs of pharaoh's people said, 'Wilt thou leave Moses and his people to create disorder in the land and forsake thee and thy gods?' He answered, 'We will ruthlessly slay their sons and let their women live. And surely we are dominant over them
7|128|Moses said to his people, 'Seek help from God and be steadfast. Verily the earth is God's; He gives it as a heritage to whomsoever He pleases of His servants and the good end is for the God-fearing
7|129|They replied, 'We were persecuted before thou camest to us and even after thou camest to us.' He said, 'Your Lord is about to destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land, that He may see how you act
7|130|And We afflicted Pharaoh's people with years of draught and scarcity of fruits, that they might take heed
7|131|But whenever good befell them, they said, 'This is for us.' And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed the evil fortune to Moses and those with him. Now, surely, the cause of their evil fortune was with God. But most of them know not
7|132|And they said, 'Whatever Sign thou mayest bring to us to bewitch us with, we will not submit to thee
7|133|Then We sent upon them the storm and the locust and the lice and the frogs and the blood -- clear Signs; but they behaved proudly and were a sinful people
7|134|And when there fell upon them the punishment, they said, 'O Moses, pray for us to thy Lord according to that which He has promised to thee. If thou remove from us the punishment, we will surely believe thee and we will surely send with thee the Children of Israel
7|135|But when We removed from them the punishment for a term which they were to reach, lo! they broke their promise
7|136|So We took vengeance upon them and drowned them in the sea, because they treated Our Signs as lies and were heedless of them
7|137|And We caused the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof, which We blessed. And the gracious word of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they were steadfast; and We utterly destroyed all that Pharaoh and his people has built and all that they had erected
7|138|And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came to a people who were devoted to their idols. They said, 'O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.' He said, 'Surely you are an ignorant people
7|139|Surely, all that these people are engaged in shall be destroyed, and vain shall be all that they do
7|140|He said, 'Shall I seek for you a god other than God, while He has exalted you above all peoples
7|141|And remember the time when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with grievous torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. And therein was a great trial for you from your Lord
7|142|And We made Moses a promise of thirty nights and supplemented them with ten. Thus the period appointed by his Lord was completed -- forty nights. And Moses said to his brother, Aaron, 'Take my place amongst my people in my absence, and manage them well and follow not the way of the mischief-makers
7|143|And when Moses came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show Thyself to me that I may look at Thee.' God replied, 'Thou shalt not see Me. But look at the mountain; and if it remains in its place, then thou shalt see Me.' And when his Lord manifested Himself on the mountain, He broke it into pieces and Moses fell down unconscious. And when he recovered, he said, 'Holy art Thou, I turn to thee and I am the first to believe
7|144|God said, 'O Moses, I have chosen thee above the people of thy time by My Messages and by My Word. So take firm hold of that which I have given thee and be of the grateful
7|145|And We wrote for him upon the Tablets about everything an admonition and an explanation of all things. 'So hold them fast and bid thy people follow the best thereof. Soon shall I show you the abode of the transgressors
7|146|I shall soon turn away from My Signs those who behave proudly in the land in an unjust manner; and even if they see all the Signs, they will not believe therein; and if they see the way of righteousness, they will not adopt it as their way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as their way. That is because they treated Our Signs as lies and were heedless of them
7|147|And those who reject Our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter -- their works are vain. Can they expect to be rewarded for anything except for what they do
7|148|And the people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, a calf -- a lifeless body, producing a lowing sound. Did they not see that it spoke not to them, nor guided them to any way? They took it for worship and they were transgressors
7|149|And when they were smitten with remorse and saw that they had indeed gone astray, they said, 'If our Lord have not mercy on us and forgive us, we shall surely be of the losers
7|150|And when Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said, 'Evil is that which you did in my place in my absence. Did you hasten to devise a way for yourselves without waiting for the command of your Lord?' And he put down the tablet and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards himself. Aaron said, 'Son of my mother, the people indeed deemed me weak, and were about to kill me. Therefore make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune and place me not with the unjust people
7|151|Moses said, 'My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Thy mercy and Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy
7|152|As to those, who took the calf for worship, wrath from their Lord shall overtake them and abasement in the present life. And thus do We reward those who invent lies
7|153|And those who do evil deeds and repent and believe, surely, thy Lord after that is Most Forgiving, Merciful
7|154|And when the anger of Moses subsided, he took the tablets and in their writing there was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord
7|155|And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointment. But when the earthquake overtook them, he said, 'My Lord, if Thou hadst pleased, Thou couldst have destroyed them before this, and me too. Wilt Thou destroy us for that which the foolish among us have done? This is nothing but a trial from Thee. Thou causest to perish thereby whom Thou pleasest and Thou guidest whom Thou pleasest. Thou art our Protector; forgive us then and have mercy upon us and Thou art the Best of those who forgive
7|156|And ordain for us good in this world, as well as in the next; we have turned to Thee with repentance.' God replied, 'I will inflict My punishment on whom I will; but My mercy encompasses all things; so I will ordain it for those who act righteously and pay the Zakaat and those who believe in Our Signs
7|157|Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet, the Ummi whom they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel which are with them. He enjoins on them good and forbids them evil and makes lawful for them the good things and forbids them the bad things and remove from them their burdens and shackles that were upon them. So those who shall believe in him and honour and support him and help him and follow the light that has been sent down with him -- these shall prosper
7|158|Say, 'O mankind, truly I am a Messenger to you all from God to Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He gives life and He causes death. So believe in God and His Messenger, the Ummi Prophet, who believes in God and His words; and follow him that you may be rightly guided
7|159|And of the people of Moses there is a party who guide with truth and do justice therewith
7|160|And We divided them into twelve tribes, distinct peoples. And, We revealed to Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying, 'Strick the rock with thy rod;' and from it there gushed forth twelve springs; every tribe knew their drinking place. And We caused the clouds to overshadow them and We sent down for them Manna and Salwa and We said, 'Eat of the good things We have provided for you.' And they wronged Us not, but it was themselves that they wronged
7|161|And remember the time when it was said to them, 'Dwell in this town and eat therefrom wherever you will, and say, 'God! lighten our burden,' and enter the gate in humility, We shall forgive you your sins, and surely We shall give increase to those who do good
7|162|But the transgressors among them changed it for a word other than that which was said to them. So We sent upon them a punishment from heaven, because of their wrongdoing
7|163|And ask them concerning the town which stood by the sea. When they profaned the Sabbath; when their fish came to them on their Sabbath day appearing on the surface of the water, but on the day when they did not keep the Sabbath, they came not to them. Thus did We try them because they were rebellious
7|164|And when a party among them said to another party, 'Why do you admonish a people whom God is going to destroy or punish with a severe punishment?' They said, 'In order to be absolved from blame before your Lord and that they may turn to righteousness
7|165|And when they forgot all that with which they had been admonished, We saved those who forbade evil and We seized the transgressors with a severe punishment because they were rebellious
7|166|And when they insolently rebelled against that which they had been forbidden, We said to them, 'Be ye apes despised
7|167|And remember the time when thy Lord proclaimed that He would surely rise against them, till the Day of Resurrection, those who would afflict them with grievous torment. Surely, thy Lord is Quick in retribution and surely He is also Most forgiving, Merciful
7|168|And We broke them up into separate peoples in the earth. Among them are those that are righteous and among them are those that are otherwise. And We tried them with good things and bad things that they might return to good
7|169|Then there came after them an evil generation who inherited the Book. They take the paltry goods of this low world and say, 'It will be forgiven us.' But if there came to them similar goods again, they would take them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not say of God anything but the truth? And they have studied what is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand
7|170|And as for those who hold fast by the Book and observe Prayer, surely, We suffer not the reward of the righteous to perish
7|171|And when We shook the mountain over them as though it were a covering and they thought it was going to fall on them, We said, 'Hold fast that which We have given you and remember what is therein that you may guard against evil
7|172|And remember when thy Lord brought forth from Adam's children -- out of their loins -- their offspring and made them to bear witness against their ownselves saying, 'Yea, we do bear witness.' This He did lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, 'We were surely unaware of this
7|173|Or lest you should say, 'It was only our fathers who associated co-partners with God in the past and we were merely a generation after them. Wilt Thou then destroy us for what those, who lied, did
7|174|And thus do We make clear the Signs, that they may be admonished and that they may return to good
7|175|And relate to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Signs, but he stepped away from them; so Satan followed him up and he became one of those who go astray
7|176|And if We pleased, We would have exalted him thereby; but he inclined to the earth and followed his evil desires. His case, therefore, is like the case of a thirsty dog; if thou drive him away, he hangs out his tongue and if thou leave him, he hangs out his tongue. Such is the case of the people who disbelieve in Our Signs. So relate to them this narrative that they may reflect
7|177|Evil is the case of the people who treat Our Signs as lies. And it was their ownselves that they wronged
7|178|He whom God guides, is on the right path. And they whom He leaves in error, these it is who shall be the losers
7|179|Verily, We have created many of the jinn and the men whose end shall be Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not and they have eyes wherewith they see not and they have ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle; nay, they are even more astray. They are indeed altogether heedless
7|180|And to God alone belong all perfect attributes. So call on Him by these attributes. And leave alone those who deviate from the right way with respect to His attributes. They shall be requited for what they do
7|181|And of those We have created, there are a people that guide men with truth and do justice therewith
7|182|And those who reject Our Signs, We will draw them towards destruction step by step in a manner which they do not know
7|183|And I give them respite, surely My plan is mighty
7|184|Do they not consider that there is nothing of insanity about their companion? He is only a plain warner
7|185|And do they not look into the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all things that God has created? And do they not see that, it may be, their own term has already drawn near? Then in what thing after this will they believe
7|186|Whomsoever God adjudges astray, there can be no guide for him. And He leave such in their transgression, wandering in distraction
7|187|They ask thee about the Hour; 'When it will come to pass?' Say, 'The knowledge thereof is only with my Lord. None can manifest it at its time but He. It lies heavy on the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you but of a sudden.' They ask thee as if thou were well-acquainted therewith. Say, 'The knowledge thereof is only with God; but most men do not know
7|188|Say, 'I have no power to do good or harm to myself save as God please. And if I had the knowledge of the unseen, I should have secured abundance of good; and evil would not have touched me. I am only a Warner and a bearer of good tidings
7|189|He it is Who created you from a single soul and made therefrom its mate, that he might find comfort in her. And when he knows her, she bears a light burden and goes about with it. And when she grows heavy, they both pray to God, their Lord, saying, 'If thou gives us a good child, we will surely be of the thankful
7|190|But when He gives them a good child, they associate with Him partners in respect of that which He has given them. But exalted is God far above what they associate with Him
7|191|Do they associate with Him partners those who create nothing, and are themselves created
7|192|And they give them no help, nor can they help themselves
7|193|And if you call them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same to you whether you call them or you remain silent
7|194|Surely, those whom you call on beside God are creatures like you. Then call on them and let them answer you, if you are truthful
7|195|Have they feet wherewith they walk, or have they hands wherewith they hold, or have they eyes wherewith they see, or have they ears wherewith they hear? Say, 'Call upon the partners you associate with God, then contrive you all against me and give me no respite
7|196|Truly my Protector is God Who revealed this Book. And He protects the righteous
7|197|And they whom you call besides Him have no power to help you, nor can they help themselves
7|198|And if you invite them to guidance, they hear not. And thou seest them looking towards thee, but they see not
7|199|Do thou ever forebear, O Prophet! and enjoin kindness, and turn away from the ignorant
7|200|And if an evil suggestion of Satan assail thee, then seek refuge in God; surely, He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing
7|201|As to those who are righteous, when an evil suggestion from Satan assails them, they remember God and behold! they begin to see aright
7|202|And the brethren of the disbelievers draw them into error and then they relax not their efforts
7|203|And when thou bringest not to them a fresh Sign, they say, 'Why hast thou not forged one?' Say, `I follow only that which is revealed to me from my Lord. These are clear proofs from your Lord and guidance and mercy for a people who believe
7|204|And when the Qur'an is recited, give ear to it and keep silence, that you may be shown mercy
7|205|And remember thy Lord in thy mind humbly and fearing Him, and in a low voice in the mornings and evenings; and be not of the heedless
7|206|Truly those who are near to thy Lord, turn not away with pride from His worship, but they glorify Him and prostrate themselves before Him
8|1|They ask thee concerning the spoils. Say, 'The spoils of war are for God and the Messenger. So fear God, and set things right among yourselves, and obey God and His Messenger, if you are believers
8|2|They are only the true believers whose hearts tremble when the name of God is mentioned, and when His Signs are recited to them they increase their faith, and who put their trust in their Lord
8|3|Who observe Prayer and spend out of that which We have provided for them
8|4|These it is who are true believers. They have exalted grades of rank with their Lord, as well as forgiveness and an honourable provision
8|5|This is because thy Lord has brought thee forth from thy house for a righteous purpose while a party of the believers were quite averse to it
8|6|They (the disbelievers) dispute with thee concerning the truth after it has become manifest, as though they are being driven to death while they actually see it
8|7|And remember when God promised you one of the two parties that it should be yours, and you wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but God desired to establish the Truth by His words and to cut off the root of the disbelievers
8|8|That He might establish the Truth and bring to naught that which is false, although the guilty may dislike it
8|9|When you implored the help of your Lord, and He answered your prayer saying, 'I will surely help you with a thousand of the angels, rank on rank
8|10|And God made it only as a glad tidings so that your hearts might be at rest. But help comes from God alone; surely God is Mighty, Wise
8|11|And when He caused sleep to come upon you as a sign of security from Him, and He sent down water upon you from the clouds, that thereby He might purify you, and remove from you the uncleanliness of Satan, and that He might strengthen your hearts and make your steps firm therewith
8|12|When thy Lord revealed to the angels, saying, 'I am with you; so make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Smite them above their necks, and smite off all finger-tips
8|13|That is because they have opposed God and His Messenger. And whoso opposes God and His Messenger, Then God is surely Severe in retribution
8|14|That is your punishment, taste it then; and remember that for disbelievers there is the punishment of the Fire
8|15|O ye who believe! when you meet those who disbelieve, advancing in force, turn not your backs to them
8|16|And whoso turns his back to them on such a day, unless manoeuvring for battle or turning to join another company, he indeed draws upon himself the wrath of God, and Hell shall be his abode. And an evil resort it is
8|17|So you slew them not; but it was God Who slew them. And thou threwest not when thou didst throw, but it was God Who threw, that He might overthrow the disbelievers and that He might confer on the believers a great favour from Himself. Surely, God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing
8|18|That is what happened; And know that God will weaken the design of the disbelievers
8|19|If you, O disbelievers, sort a judgment, then judgment has indeed come to you. And if you desist, it will be better for you; but if you return to mischief, We too will return to punishment. And your party shall be of no avail to you, however numerous it be, and know that God is with the believers
8|20|O ye who believe! obey God and His Messenger, and do not turn away from him while you hear his commands
8|21|And be not like those who say, 'We hear,' but they hear not
8|22|Surely, the worst of beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb, who have no sense
8|23|And if God had known any good in them, He would certainly have made them hear. And if He now makes them hear, they will turn away in aversion
8|24|O ye who believe! respond to God, and the Messenger when he calls you that he may give you life, and know that God comes in between a man and his heart, and that He it is unto Whom you will be gathered
8|25|And beware of an affliction which will surely not smite exclusively those among you who have done wrong. And know that God is Severe in requiting
8|26|And remember when you were a few and deemed weak in the land, and were in fear lest people should snatch you away, but He sheltered you and strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things that you might be thankful
8|27|O ye who believe! prove not false to God and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts knowingly
8|28|And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that it is God with Whom is a great reward
8|29|O ye who believe! if you do your duty to God, He will grant you a distinction and will remove your evils from you and will forgive you; and God is the Lord of great bounty
8|30|And remember when the disbelievers devised plans against thee that they might put thee in confinement or slay thee or expel thee. And they planned and God also planned, and God is the Best of planners
8|31|And when Our verses are recited to them, they say, 'We have heard. If we wished we could certainly say the like of it. This is nothing but mere tales of the ancients
8|32|And remember the time when they said, 'O God, if this be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down upon us stones from heaven or bring down upon us a grievous punishment
8|33|But God would not punish them while thou wast among them, and God would not punish them while they sought forgiveness
8|34|And what excuse have they now that God should not punish them, when they hinder men from the Sacred Mosque, and they are not its true guardians? Its true guardians are only those who are righteous, but most of them know not
8|35|And their prayer at the Sacred House is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. 'Taste then the punishment because you disbelieved
8|36|Surely, those who disbelieve, spend their wealth to turn people away from the way of God. They will surely continue to spend it; but then shall it become a source of regret for them, and then shall they be overcome. And the disbelievers shall be gathered unto Hell
8|37|That God may separate the bad from the good, and put the bad, one upon another, and heap them up altogether, and then cast them into Hell. These indeed are the losers
8|38|Say to those who disbelieve, if they desist, that which is past will be forgiven them; and if they return to their misdeeds, then verily the example of the former peoples has already gone before them
8|39|And fight them until there is no persecution and religion is wholly to God. But if they desist, then surely God is Watchful of what they do
8|40|And if they turn back, then know that God is your Protector -- an excellent protector and an excellent Helper
8|41|And know that whenever ye gain any spoils, a fifth part thereof belongeth unto God, and to the apostle, and his kindred, and the orphans, and the poor, and the traveller; if ye believe in God, and that which we have sent down unto our servant on the day of distinction, on the day whereon the two armies met: And God is almighty
8|42|When ye were incamped on the hithermost side of the valley, and they were incamped on the further side, and the caravan was below you; and if ye had mutually appointed to come to a battle, ye would certainly have declined the appointment; but ye were brought to an engagement without any previous appointment, that God might accomplish the thing which was decreed to be done, that he who perisheth hereafter may perish after demonstrative evidence, and that he who liveth may live by the same evidence God both heareth and knoweth
8|43|When thy Lord caused the enemy to appear unto thee in thy sleep, few in number; and if He had caused them to appear numerous unto thee, ye would have been disheartened and would have disputed concerning the matter: But God preserved you from this; for He knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
8|44|And when He caused them to appear unto you, when ye met, to be few in your eyes; and diminished your numbers in their eyes; that God might accomplish the thing which was decreed to be done: And unto God shall all things return
8|45|O true believers, when ye meet a party of the infidels, stand firm, and remember God frequently, that ye may prosper
8|46|And obey God and his apostle, and be not refractory, lest ye be discouraged, and your success depart from you; but persevere with patience, for God is with those who persevere
8|47|And be not as those who went out of their houses in an insolent manner, and to appear with ostentation unto men, and turned aside from the way of God; for God comprehendeth that which they do
8|48|And remember when Satan prepared their works for them, and said, no man shall prevail against you to day; and I will surely be near to assist you. But when the two armies appeared in sight of each other, he turned back on his heels, and said, verily I am clear of you: I certainly see that which ye see not; I fear God, for God is severe in punishing
8|49|When the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts there was an infirmity, said, their religion hath deceived these men: But whosoever confideth in God cannot be deceived; for God is mighty and wise
8|50|And if thou didst behold when the angels cause the unbelievers to die: They strike their faces and their backs, and say unto them, taste ye the pain of burning
8|51|This shall ye suffer for that which your hands have sent before you; and because God is not unjust towards his servants
8|52|These have acted according to the wont of the people of Pharaoh, and of those before them, who disbelieved in the signs of God: Therefore God took them away in their iniquity; for God is mighty, and severe in punishing
8|53|This hath come to pass because God changeth not his grace, wherewith He hath favoured any people, until they change that which is in their souls; and for that God both heareth and seeth
8|54|According to the wont of the people of Pharaoh, and of those before them, who charged the signs of their Lord with imposture, have they acted: Wherefore We destroyed them in their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh; for they were all unjust persons
8|55|Verily the worst cattle in the sight of God are those who are obstinate infidels, and will not believe
8|56|As to those who enter into a league with thee, and afterwards violate their league at every convenient opportunity, and fear not God
8|57|if thou take them in war, disperse, by making them an example, those who shall come after them, that they may be warned
8|58|or if thou apprehend treachery from any people, throw back their league unto them, with like treatment; for God loveth not the treacherous
8|59|And think not that the unbelievers have escaped God's vengeance, for they shall not weaken the power of God
8|60|Therefore prepare against them what force ye are able, and troops of horse, whereby ye may strike a terror into the enemy of God, and your enemy, and into other infidels besides them, whom ye know not, but God knoweth them. And whatsoever ye shall expend in the defence of the religion of God, it shall be repaid unto you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly
8|61|And if they incline unto peace, do thou also incline thereto; and put thy confidence in God, for it is He who heareth and knoweth
8|62|But if they seek to deceive thee, verily God will be thy support. It is He who hath strengthened thee with his help, and with that of the faithful
8|63|and hath united their hearts. If thou hadst expended whatever riches are in the earth, thou couldest not have united their hearts, but God united them; for He is mighty and wise
8|64|O prophet, God is thy support, and such of the true believers who followeth thee
8|65|O prophet, stir up the faithful to war: If twenty of you persevere with constancy, they shall overcome two hundred, and of there be one hundred of you, they shall overcome a thousand of those who believe not; because they are a people which do not understand
8|66|Now hath God eased you, for He knew that ye were weak. If there be an hundred of you who persevere with constancy, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there be a thousand of you, they shall overcome two thousand, by the permission of God; for God is with those who persevere
8|67|It hath not been granted unto any prophet, that he should possess captives, until he had made a great slaughter of the infidels in the earth. Ye seek the accidental goods of this world, but God regardeth the life to come; and God is mighty and wise
8|68|Unless a revelation had been previously delivered from God, verily a severe punishment had been inflicted on you, for the ransom which ye took from the captives at Bedr
8|69|Eat therefore of what ye have acquired, that which is lawful, and good; for God is gracious and merciful
8|70|O prophet, say unto the captives who are in your hands, if God shall know any good to be in your hearts, He will give you better than what hath been taken from you; and He will forgive you, for God is gracious and merciful
8|71|But if they seek to deceive thee, verily they have deceived God before; wherefore He hath given thee power over them: And God is knowing and wise
8|72|Moreover they who have believed, and have fled their country, and employed their substance and their persons in fighting for the religion of God, and they who have given the prophet a refuge among them, and have assisted him, these shall be deemed the one nearest of kin to the other. But they who have believed, but have not fled their country, shall have no right of kindred at all with you, until they also fly. Yet if they ask assistance of you on account of religion, it belongeth unto you to give them assistance; except against a people between whom and yourselves there shall be a league subsisting: And God seeth that which ye do
8|73|And as to the infidels, let them be deemed of kin the one to the other. Unless ye do this, there will be a sedition in the earth, and grievous corruption
8|74|But as for them who have believed, and left their country, and have fought for God's true religion, and who have allowed the prophet a retreat among them, and have assisted him, these are really believers; they shall receive mercy, and an honourable provision
8|75|And they who have believed since, and have fled their country, and have fought with you, these also are of you. And those who are related by consanguinity shall be deemed the nearest of kin to each other, preferably to strangers, according to the book of God; God knoweth all things
9|1|A declaration of immunity from God and his apostle, unto the idolaters with whom ye have entered into league
9|2|Go to and fro in the earth securely four months; and know that ye shall not weaken God, and that God will disgrace the unbelievers
9|3|And a declaration from God and his apostle unto the people, on the day of the greater pilgrimage, that God is clear of the idolaters, and his apostle also. Wherefore if ye repent, this will be better for you; but if ye turn back, know that ye shall not weaken God: And denounce unto those who believe not, a painful punishment
9|4|Except such of the idolaters with whom ye shall have entered into a league, and who afterwards shall not fail you in any instance, nor assist any other against you. Wherefore perform the covenant which ye shall have made with them, until their time shall be elapsed; for God loveth those who fear him
9|5|And when the months wherein ye are not allowed to attack them shall be past, kill the idolaters wheresoever ye shall find them, and take them prisoners, and besiege them, and lay wait for them in every convenient place. But if they shall repent, and observe the appointed times of prayer, and pay the legal alms, dismiss them freely; for God is gracious and merciful
9|6|And if any of the idolaters shall demand protection of thee, grant him protection, that he may hear the word of God; and afterwards let him reach the place of his security. This shalt thou do, because they are people which know not the excellency of the religion thou preachest
9|7|How shall the idolaters be admitted into a league with God and with his apostle; except those with whom ye entered into a league at the holy temple? So long as they behave with fidelity towards you, do ye also behave with fidelity towards them; for God loveth those who fear him
9|8|How can they be admitted into a league with you, since, if they prevail against you, they will not regard in you either consanguinity or faith? They will please you with their mouths, but their hearts will be averse from you; for the greater part of them are wicked doers
9|9|They sell the signs of God for a small price, and obstruct his way; it is certainly evil which they do
9|10|They regard not in a believer either consanguinity or faith; and these are the transgressors
9|11|Yet if they repent, and observe the appointed times of prayer, and give alms, they shall be deemed your brethren in religion. We distinctly propound our signs unto people who understand
9|12|But if they violate their oaths, after their league, and revile your religion, oppose the leaders of infidelity, -- for there is no trust in them, -- that they may desist from their treachery
9|13|Will ye not fight against people who have violated their oaths, and conspired to expel the apostle of God; and who of their own accord assaulted you the first time? Will ye fear them? But it is more just that ye should fear God, if ye are true believers
9|14|Attack them therefore; God shall punish them by your hands, and will cover them with shame, and will give you the victory over them; and He will heal the breasts of the people who believe
9|15|and will take away the indignation of their hearts: For God will be turned unto whom He pleaseth; and God is knowing and wise
9|16|Did ye imagine that ye should be abandoned, whereas God did not yet know those among you who fought for his religion, and took not any besides God, and his apostle, and the faithful for their friends? God is well acquainted with that which ye do
9|17|It is not fitting that the idolaters should visit the temples of God, being witnesses against their own souls of their infidelity. The works of these men are vain; and they shall remain in hell fire for ever
9|18|But he only shall visit the temples of God, who believeth in God and the last day, and is constant at prayer, and payeth the legal alms, and feareth God alone. These perhaps may become of the number of those who are rightly directed
9|19|Do ye reckon the giving drink to the pilgrims, and the visiting of the holy temple to be actions as meritorious as those performed by him who believeth in God and the last day, and fighteth for the religion of God? They shall not be held equal with God: For God directeth not the unrighteous people
9|20|They who have believed, and fled their country, and employed their substance and their persons in the defence of God's true religion, shall be in the highest degree of honour with God; and these are they who shall be happy
9|21|Their Lord sendeth them good tidings of mercy from Him, and good will, and of gardens wherein they shall enjoy lasting pleasure
9|22|they shall continue therein for ever: For with God is a great reward
9|23|O true believers, take not your fathers or your brethren for friends, if they love infidelity above faith; and whosoever among you shall take them for his friends, they will be unjust doers
9|24|Say, if your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your relations, and your substance which ye have acquired, and your merchandize which ye apprehend may not be sold off, and your dwellings wherein ye delight, be more dear unto you than God, and his apostle, and the advancement of his religion; wait, until God shall send his command: For God directeth not the ungodly people
9|25|Now hath God assisted you in many engagements, and particularly at the battle of Honein; when ye pleased your selves in your multitude, but it was no manner of advantage unto you, and the earth became too strait for you, notwithstanding it was spacious; then did ye retreat and turn your backs
9|26|Afterwards God sent down his security upon his apostle and upon the faithful, and sent down troops of angels which ye saw not; and he punished those who disbelieved: And this was the reward of the unbelievers
9|27|Nevertheless God will hereafter be turned unto whom He pleaseth; for God is gracious and merciful
9|28|O true believers, verily the idolaters are unclean; let them not therefore come near unto the holy temple after this year. And if ye fear want, by the cutting off trade and communication with them, God will enrich you of his abundance, if He pleaseth; for God is knowing and wise
9|29|Fight against them who believe not in God, nor in the last day, and forbid not that which God and his apostle have forbidden, and profess not the true religion, of those unto whom the scriptures have been delivered, until they pay tribute by right of subjection, and they be reduced low
9|30|The Jews say, Ezra is the son of God: And the Christians say Christ is the son of God. They say this (only) with their mouths: They imitate the saying of those who were unbelievers in former times. May God curse them (literally: fight against them)! How can they be so infatuated
9|31|They take their priests and their monks for their lords, besides God, and Christ the son of Mary; although they are commanded to worship one God only: There is no God but He; far be that from Him, which they associate with Him
9|32|They seek to extinguish the light of God with their mouths; but God willeth no other than to perfect his light, although the infidels be averse thereto
9|33|It is He who hath sent his apostle with the direction, and true religion: That He may cause it to appear superior to every other religion; although the idolaters be averse thereto
9|34|O true believers, verily many of the priests and monks devour the substance of men in vanity, and obstruct the way of God. But unto whose who treasure up gold and silver, and employ it not for the advancement of God's true religion, denounce a grievous punishment
9|35|On the day of judgment their treasures shall be intensely heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads, and their sides, and their backs shall be stigmatized therewith; and their tormentors shall say, this is what ye have treasured up for your souls; taste therefore that which ye have treasured up
9|36|Moreover, the complete number of months with God, is twelve months, which were ordained in the book of God, on the day whereon He created the heavens and the earth: Of these, four are sacred. This is the right religion: Therefore deal not unjustly with your selves therein. But attack the idolaters in all the months, as they attack you in all; and know that God is with those who fear Him
9|37|Verily the transferring of a sacred month to another month, is an additional infidelity. The unbelievers are led into an error thereby: They allow a month to be violated one year, and declare it sacred another year, that they may agree in the number of months which God hath commanded to be kept sacred; and they allow that which God hath forbidden. The evil of their actions hath been prepared for them: For God directeth not the unbelieving people
9|38|O true believers, what ailed you, that, when it was said unto you, go forth to fight for the religion of God, ye inclined heavily towards the earth? Do ye prefer the present life to that which is to come? But the provision of this life, in respect of that which is to come, is but slender
9|39|Unless ye go forth when ye are summoned to war, God will punish you with a grievous punishment; and He will place another people in your stead, and ye shall not hurt him at all; for God is almighty
9|40|If ye assist not the prophet, verily God will assist him, as he assisted him formerly, when the unbelievers drove him out of Mecca, the second of two: When they were both in the cave; when he said unto his companion, be not grieved, for God is with us. And God sent down his security upon him, and strenghtened him with armies of angels, whom ye saw not. And He made the word of those who believed not, to be abased, and the word of God was exalted; for God is mighty and wise
9|41|Go forth to battle, both light, and heavy, and employ your substance and your persons for the advancement of God's religion. This will be better for you; if ye know it
9|42|If it had been a near advantage, and a moderate journey, they had surely followed thee; but the way seemed tedious unto them: And yet they will swear by God, saying, if we had been able, we had surely gone forth with you. They destroy their own souls; for God knoweth that they are liars
9|43|God forgive thee! Why didst thou give them leave to stay at home, until they who speak the truth, when they excuse themselves, had become manifested unto thee, and thou hadst known the liars
9|44|They who believe in God and the last day, will not ask leave of thee, to be excused from employing their substance and their persons for the advancement of God's true religion; and God knoweth those who fear him
9|45|Verily they only will ask leave of thee to stay behind, who believe not in God and the last day, and whose hearts doubt concerning the faith: Wherefore they are tossed to and fro in their doubting
9|46|If they had been willing to go forth with thee, they had certainly prepared for that purpose a provision of arms and necessaries: But God was averse to their going forth; wherefore He rendered them slothful, and it was said unto them, sit ye still with those who sit still
9|47|If they had gone forth with you, they had only been a burden unto you, and had run to and fro between you, stirring you up to sedition; and there would have been some among you, who would have given ear unto them: An God knoweth the wicked
9|48|They formerly sought to raise a sedition, and they disturbed thy affairs, until the truth came, and the decree of God was made manifest; although they were averse thereto
9|49|There is of them who saith unto thee, give me leave to stay behind, and expose me not to temptation. Have they not fallen into temptation at home? But hell will surely encompass the unbelievers
9|50|If good happen unto thee, it grieveth them: But if a misfortune befall thee, they say, we ordered our business before; and they turn their backs, and rejoice at thy mishap
9|51|Say, nothing shall befall us, but what God hath decreed for us: He is our patron; and on God let the faithful trust
9|52|Say, do ye expect any other should befall us, than one of the two most excellent things; either victory or martyrdom? But we expect concerning you, that God inflict a punishment on you, either from himslef, or by our hands. Wait therefore to see what will be the end of both; for we will wait with you
9|53|Say, expend your money in pious uses, either voluntarily, or by constraint, it shall not be accepted of you; because ye are wicked people
9|54|And nothing hindreth their contributions from being accepted of them, but that they believe not in God and his apostle, and perform not the duty of prayer, otherwise than sluggishly; and expend not their money for God's service, otherwise than unwillingly
9|55|Let not therefore their riches, or their children cause thee to marvel. Verily God intendeth only to punish them by these things in this world; and that their souls may depart while they are unbelievers
9|56|They swear by God that they are of you; yet they are not of you, but are people who stand in fear
9|57|If they find a place of refuge, or caves, or a retreating hole, they surely turn towards the same, and in a headstrong manner haste thereto
9|58|There is of them also who spreadeth ill reports of thee, in relation to thy distribution of the alms: Yet if they receive part thereof, they are well pleased; but if they receive not a part thereof, behold, they are angry
9|59|But if they had been pleased with that which God and his apostle had given them, and had said, God is our support; God will give unto us of his abundance and his prophet also; verily unto God do we make our supplications: It would have been more decent
9|60|Alms are to be distributed only unto the poor, and the needy, and those who are employed in collecting and distributing the same, and unto those whose hearts are reconciled, and for the redemption of captives, and unto those who are in debt and insolvent, and for the advancement of God's religion, and unto the traveller. This is an ordinance from God: And God is knowing and wise
9|61|There are some of them who injure the prophet, and say, he is an ear: Answer, he is an ear of good unto you; he believeth in God, and giveth credit to the faithful, and is a mercy unto such of you who believe. But they who injure the apostle of God, shall suffer a painful punishment
9|62|They swear unto you by God, that they may please you; but it is more just that they should please God and his apostle, if they are true believers
9|63|Do they not know that he who opposeth God and his apostle, shall without doubt be punished with the fire of hell; and shall remain therein for ever? This will be great ignominy
9|64|The hypocrites are apprehensive lest a sura should be revealed concerning them, to declare unto them that which is in their hearts. Say unto them, scoff ye; but God will surely bring to light that which ye fear should be discovered
9|65|And if thou ask them the reason of this scoffing, they say, verily we were only engaged in discourse, and jesting among ourselves. Say, do ye scoff at God and his signs, and at his apostle
9|66|Offer not an excuse: Now are ye become infidels, after your faith. If we forgive a part of you, we will punish a part, for that they have been wicked doers
9|67|Hypocritical men and women are the one of them of the other: They command that which is evil, and forbid that which is just, and shut their hands from giving alms. They have forgotten God; wherefore He hath forgotten them: Verily the hypocrites are those who act wickedly
9|68|God denounceth unto the hypocrites, both men and women, and to the unbelievers, the fire of hell; they shall remain therein for ever: This will be their sufficient reward; God hath cursed them, and they shall endure a lasting torment
9|69|As they who have been before you, so are ye. They were superior to you in strength, and had more abundance of wealth and of children; and they enjoyed their portion in this world; and ye also enjoy your portion here, as they who have preceded you, enjoyed their portion. And ye engage your selves in vain discourses, like unto those wherein they engaged themselves. The works of these are vain both in this world, and in that which is to come; and these are they who perish
9|70|Have they not been acquainted with the history of those who have been before them? Of the people of Noah, and of Ad, and of Thamud, and of the people of Abraham, and of the inhabitants of Madian, and of the cities which were overthrown? Their apostles came unto them with evident demonstrations: And God was not disposed to treat them unjustly; but they dealt unjustly with their own souls
9|71|And the faithful men, and the faithful women are friends one to another: They command that which is just, and they forbid that which is evil; and they are constant at prayer, and pay their appointed alms; and they obey God, and his apostle: Unto these will God be merciful; for He is mighty and wise
9|72|God promiseth unto the true believers, both men and women, gardens through which rivers flow, wherein they shall remain for ever; and delicious dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode: But good will from God shall be their most excellent reward. This will be great felicity
9|73|O prophet, wage war against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe unto them: For their dwelling shall be hell; an unhappy journey shall it be thither
9|74|They swear by God that they said not what they are charged with: Yet they spake the word of infidelity, and became unbelievers, after they had embraced Islam. And they designed that which they could not effect; and they did not disapprove the design for any other reason, than because God and his apostle had inriched them, of his bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them; but if they relapse, God will punish them with a grievous torment, in this world and in the next; and they shall have no patron on earth, nor any protector
9|75|There are some of them who made a covenant with God, saying, verily if He give us of his abundance, we will give alms, and become righteous people
9|76|Yet when He had given unto them of his abundance, they became covetous thereof, and turned back, and retired afar off
9|77|Wherefore He hath caused hypocrisy to succeed in their hearts, until the day whereon they shall meet Him; for that they failed to perform unto God that which they had promised Him, and for that they prevaricated
9|78|Do they not know that God knoweth whatever they conceal, and their private discourses; and that God is the knower of secrets
9|79|They who traduce such of the believers as are liberal in giving alms beyond what they are obliged, and those who find nothing to give, but what they gain by their industry; and therefore scoff at them: God shall scoff at them, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment
9|80|Ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them; it will be equal. If thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times, God will by no means forgive them. This is the divine pleasure, for that they believe not in God, and his apostle; and God directeth not the ungodly people
9|81|They who were left at home in he expedition of Tabuc, were glad of their staying behind the apostle of God, and were unwilling to employ their substance and their persons for the advancement of God's true religion; and they said, go not forth in the heat. Say, the fire of hell will be hotter; if they understood this
9|82|Wherefore let them laugh little, and weep much, as a reward for that which they have done
9|83|If God bring thee back unto some of them, and they ask thee leave to go forth to war with thee, say, ye shall not go forth with me for the future, neither shall ye fight an enemy with me; ye were pleased with sitting at home the first time; sit ye at home therefore with those who stay behind
9|84|Neither do thou ever pray over any of them who shall die, neither stand at his grave; for that they believed not in God and his apostle, and die in their wickedness
9|85|Let not their riches or their children cause thee to marvel: For God intendeth only to punish them therewith in this world; and that their souls may depart, while they are infidels
9|86|When a sura is sent down, wherein it is said, believe in God, and go forth to war with his apostle; those who are in plentiful circumstances among them ask leave of thee to stay behind, and say, suffer us to be of the number of those who sit at home
9|87|They are well pleased to be with those who stay behind, and their hearts are sealed up; wherefore they do not understand
9|88|But the apostle, and those who have believed with him, expose their fortunes and their lives for God's service; they shall enjoy the good things of either life, and they shall be happy
9|89|God hath prepared for them gardens through which rivers flow; they shall remain therein for ever. This will be great felicity
9|90|And certain Arabs of the desert came to excuse themselves, praying that they might be permitted to stay behind; and they sat at home who had renounced God and his apostle. But a painful punishment shall be inflicted on such of them as believe not
9|91|In those who are weak, or are afflicted with sickness, or in those who find not wherewith to contribute to the war, it shall be no crime if they stay at home; provided they behave themselves faithfully towards God and his apostle. There is no room to lay blame on the righteous; for God is gracious and merciful
9|92|Nor on those, unto whom, when they came unto thee, requesting that thou wouldest supply them with necessaries for travelling, thou didst answer, I find not wherewith to supply you, returned, their eyes shedding tears for grief, that they found not wherewith to contribute to the expedition
9|93|But there is reason to blame those who ask leave of thee to sit at home, when they are rich. They are pleased to be with those who stay behind, and God hath sealed up their hearts; wherefore they do not understand
9|94|They will excuse themselves unto you, when ye are returned unto them. Say, excuse not your selves; we will by no means believe you: God hath acquainted us with your behaviour; and God will observe your actions, and his apostle also: And hereafter shall ye be brought before Him who knoweth that which is hidden, and that which is manifest; and He will declare unto you that which ye have done
9|95|They will swear unto you by God, when ye are returned unto them, that ye may let them alone. Let them alone therefore, for they are an abomination, and their dwelling shall be hell, a reward for that which they have deserved
9|96|They will swear unto you, that ye may be well pleased with them; but if ye be well pleased with them, verily God will not be well pleased with people who prevaricate
9|97|The Arabs of the desert are more obstinate in their unbelief and hypocrisy; and it is easier for them to be ignorant of the ordinances of that which God hath sent down unto his apostle: And God is knowing and wise
9|98|Of the Arabs of the desert there is who reckoneth that which he expendeth for the service of God, to be as tribute; and waiteth that some change of fortune may befall you. A change for evil shall happen unto them; for God both heareth and knoweth
9|99|And of the Arabs of desert there is who believeth in God, and in the last day; and esteemeth that which he layeth out for the service of God to be the means of bringing him near unto God, and the prayers of the apostle. Is it not unto them the means of a near approach? God shall lead them into his mercy; for God is gracious and merciful
9|100|As for the leaders and the first of the Mohajerin, and the Ansars, and those who have followed them in well doing; God is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased in him: And He hath prepared for them gardens watered by rivers; they shall remain therein for ever. This shall be great felicity
9|101|And of the Arabs of the desert who dwell round about you, there are hypocritical persons: And of the inhabitants of Medina there are some who are obstinate in hypocrisy. Thou knowest them not, O prophet, but We know them: We will surely punish them twice; afterwards shall they be sent to a grievous torment
9|102|And others have acknowledged their crimes. They have mixed a good action with another which is bad: Peradventure God will be turned unto them; for God is gracious and merciful
9|103|Take alms of their substance, that thou mayest cleanse them, and purify them thereby; and pray for them; For thy prayers shall be a security of mind unto them; and God both heareth and knoweth
9|104|Do they not know that God accepteth repentance from his servants, and accepteth alms; and that God is easy to be reconciled, and merciful
9|105|Say unto them, work as ye will; but God will behold your work, and his apostle also, and the true believers: And ye shall be brought before Him who knoweth that which is kept secret, and that which is made public; and He will declare unto you whatever ye have done
9|106|And there are others who wait with suspense the decree of God; whether He will punish them, or whether He will be turned unto them: But God is knowing and wise
9|107|There are some who have built a temple to hurt the faithful, and to propagate infidelity, and to foment division among the true believers, and for a lurking place for him who hath fought against God and his apostle in time past; and they swear, saying, verily we intended no other than to do for the best: But God is witness that they do certainly lie
9|108|Stand not up to pray therein for ever. There is a temple founded on piety, from the first day of its building. It is more just that thou stand up to pray therein: Therein are men who love to be purified; for God loveth the clean
9|109|Whether therefore is he better, who hath founded his building on the fear of God and his good will; or he who hath founded his building on the brink of a bank of earth which is washed away by waters, so that it falleth with him into the fire of hell? God directeth not the ungodly people
9|110|Their building which they have built will not cease to be an occasion of doubting in their hearts, until their hearts be cut in pieces; and God is knowing and wise
9|111|Verily God hath purchased of the true believers their souls, and their substance, promising them the enjoyment of paradise; on condition that they fight for the cause of God: Whether they slay or be slain, the promise for the same is assuredly due by the law, and the gospel, and the Koran. And who performeth his contract more faithfully than God? Rejoice therefore in the contract which ye have made. This shall be great happiness
9|112|The penitent, and those who serve God, and praise him, and who fast, and bow down, and worship; and who command that which is just, and forbid that which is evil, and keep the ordinances of God, shall likewise be rewarded with paradise: Wherefore bear good tidings unto the faithful
9|113|It is not allowed unto the prophet, nor those who are true believers, that they pray for idolaters, although they be of kin, after it is become known unto them, that they are inhabitants of hell
9|114|Neither did Abraham ask forgiveness for his father, otherwise than in pursuance of a promise which he had promised unto him: But when it became known unto him, that he was an enemy unto God, he declared himself clear of him. Verily Abraham was putiful and compassionate
9|115|Nor is God disposed to lead people into error, after that He hath directed them, until that which they ought to avoid is become known unto them; for God knoweth all things
9|116|Verily unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and of earth; He giveth life, and He causeth to die; and ye have no patron or helper besides God
9|117|God is reconciled unto the prophet, and unto the Mohajerin, and the Ansars, who followed Him in the hour of distress, after that it had wanted little but that the hearts of a part of them had swerved from their duty: Afterwards was He turned unto them; for He was compassionate and merciful towards them
9|118|And He is also reconciled unto the three who were left behind, so that the earth became too strait for them, notwithstanding its spaciousness, and their souls became straitened within them, and they considered that there was no refuge from God, otherwise than by having recourse unto Him. Then was He turned unto them, that they might repent; for God is easy to be reconciled and merciful
9|119|O true believers, fear God, and be with the sincere
9|120|There was no reason why the inhabitants of Medina, and the Arabs of the desert who dwell around them, should stay behind the apostle of God, or should prefer themselves before him. This is unreasonable: Because they are not distressed either by thirst, or labour, or hunger, for the defence of God's true religion; neither do they stir a step, which may irritate the unbelievers; neither do they receive from the enemy any damage, but a good work is written down unto them for the same; for God suffereth not the reward of the righteous to perish
9|121|And they contribute not any sum either small or great, nor do they pass a valley, but it is written down unto them, that God may reward them with a recompense exceeding that which they have wrought
9|122|The believers are not obliged to go forth to war all together; If a part of every band of them go not forth, it is that they may diligently instruct themselves in their religion; and may admonish their people, when they return unto them, that they may take heed to themselves
9|123|O true believers, wage war against such of the infidels as are near you; and let them find severity in you: And know that God is with those who fear him
9|124|Whenever a sura is sent down, there are some of them who say, which of you hath this caused to increase in faith? It will increase the faith of those who believe, and they shall rejoice
9|125|But unto those in whose hearts there is an infirmity, it will add farther doubt unto their present doubt; and they shall die in their infidelity
9|126|Do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice? Yet they repent not, neither are they warned
9|127|And whenever a sura is sent down, they look at one another, saying, doth any one see you? Then do they turn aside. God shall turn aside their hearts from the truth; because they are a people who do not understand
9|128|Now hath an apostle come unto you of our own nation, an excellent person: It is grievous unto him that ye commit wickedness; He is careful over you, and compassionate and merciful towards the believers
9|129|If they turn back, say, God is my support: There is no God but He. On Him do I trust; and He is the Lord of the magnificent throne
10|1|These are the signs of the wise book
10|2|Is it a strange thing unto the men of Mecca, that We have revealed our will unto a man from among them, saying, denounce threats unto men if they believe not; and bear good tidings unto those who believe, that on the merit of their sincerity they have an interest with their Lord? The unbelievers say, this is manifest sorcery
10|3|Verily your Lord is God, who hath created the heavens and the earth in six days; and then ascended his throne, to take on himself the government of all things. There is no intercessor, but by his permission. This is God, your Lord; therefore serve him. Will ye not consider
10|4|Unto Him shall ye all return, according to the certain promise of God: For He produceth a creature, and then causeth it to return again; that He may reward those who believe and do that which is right, with equity. But as for the unbelievers, they shall drink boiling water, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment, for that they have disbelieved
10|5|It is He who hath ordained the sun to shine by day, and the moon for a light by night; and hath appointed her stations, that ye might know the number of years, and the computation of time. God hath not created this, but with truth. He explaineth his signs unto people who understand
10|6|Moreover in the vicissitude of night and day, and whatever God hath created in heaven and earth, are surely signs unto men who fear Him
10|7|Verily they who hope not to meet Us at the last day, and delight in this present life, and rest securely in the same, and who are negligent of our signs
10|8|their dwelling shall be hell fire, for that which they have deserved
10|9|But as to those who believe, and work righteousness, their Lord will direct them because of their faith; they shall have rivers flowing through gardens of pleasure
10|10|Their prayer therein shall be, praise be unto thee, O God! And their salutation therein shall be, peace! And the end of their prayer shall be, praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
10|11|If God should cause evil to hasten unto men, according to their desire of hastening good, verily their end had been decreed. Wherefore We suffer those who hope not to meet Us at the resurrection, to wander amazedly in their error
10|12|When evil befalleth a man; he prayeth unto Us lying on his side, or sitting, or standing: But when We deliver him from his affliction, he continueth his former course of life, as though he had not called upon Us to defend him against the evil which had befallen him. Thus was that which the transgressors committed prepared for them
10|13|We have formerly destroyed the generations who were before you, O men of Mecca, when they had acted unjustly, and our apostles had come unto them with evident miracles and they would not believe. Thus do We reward the wicked people
10|14|Afterwards did We cause you to succeed them in the earth; that We might see how ye would act
10|15|When our evident signs are recited unto them, they who hope not to meet us at the resurrection, say, bring a different Koran from this; or make some change therein. Answer, it is not fit for me, that I should change it at my pleasure: I follow that only which is revealed unto me. Verily I fear, if I should be disobedient unto my Lord, the punishment of the great day
10|16|Say, if God had so pleased, I had not read it unto you, neither had I taught you the same. I have already dwelt among you to the age of forty years, before I received it. Do ye not therefore understand
10|17|And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie against God, or accuseth his signs of falsehood? Surely the wicked shall not prosper
10|18|They worship besides God, that which can neither hurt them nor profit them, and they say, these are our intercessors with God. Answer, will ye tell God that which He knoweth not, neither in heaven nor in earth? Praise be unto Him! And far be that from Him, which they associate with Him
10|19|Men were professors of one religion only, but they dissented therefrom; and if a decree had not previously issued from thy Lord, deferring their punishment, verily the matter had been decided between them, concerning which they disagreed
10|20|They say, unless a sign be sent down unto him from his Lord, we will not believe. Answer, verily that which is hidden is known only unto God: Wait therefore the pleasure of God; and I also will wait with you
10|21|And when We caused the men of Mecca to taste mercy, after an affliction which had befallen them, behold, they devised a stratagem against our signs. Say unto them, God is more swift in executing a stratagem, than ye. Verily our messengers write down that which ye deceitfully devise
10|22|It is He who hath given you conveniencies for travelling by land and by sea; so that ye be in ships, which sail with them, with a favourable wind, and they rejoice therein. And when a tempestuous wind overtaketh them, and waves come upon them from every side, and they think themselves to be encompassed with inevitable dangers; they call upon God, exhibiting the pure religion unto Him, and saying, verily if Thou deliver us from this peril, we will be of those who give thanks
10|23|But when He had delivered them, behold, they behaved themselves insolently in the earth, without justice. O men, verily the violence which ye commit against your own souls, is for the enjoyment of this present life only; afterwards unto Us shall ye return, and We will declare unto you that which ye have done
10|24|Verily the likeness of this present life is no other than as water, which We send down from heaven, and wherewith the productions of the earth are mixed, of which men eat, and cattle also, until the earth receive its vesture, and be adorned with various plants: The inhabitants thereof imagine that they have power over the same; but our command cometh unto it by night, or by day, and we render it as though it had been mown, as though it had not yesterday abounded with fruits. Thus do We explain our signs unto people who consider
10|25|God inviteth unto the dwelling of peace, and directeth whom He pleaseth into the right way
10|26|They who do right shall receive a most excellent reward, and a superabundant addition; neither blackness nor shame shall cover their faces. These shall be the inhabitants of paradise; they shall continue therein for ever
10|27|But they who commit evil shall receive the reward of evil, equal thereunto, and they shall be covered with shame, -- for they shall have no protector against God; -- as though their faces were covered with the profound darkness of the night. These shall be the inhabitants of hell fire; they shall remain therein for ever
10|28|On the day of the resurrection We will gather them altogether; then will We say unto the idolaters, get ye to your place, ye and your companions: And We will separate them from one another; and their companions shall say unto them, ye did not worship us
10|29|and God is a sufficient witness between us and you; neither did we mind your worshipping of us
10|30|There shall every soul experince that which it shall have sent before it; and they shall be brought before God, their true Lord; and the false deities which they vainly imagined, shall disappear from before them
10|31|Say, who provideth you food from heaven and earth? Or who hath the absolute power over the hearing and the sight? And who bringeth forth the living from the dead, and bringeth forth the dead from the living? And who governeth all things? They will surely answer, God. Say, will ye not therefore fear Him
10|32|This is therefore God, your true Lord: And what remaineth there after truth, except error? How therefore are ye turned aside from the truth
10|33|Thus is the word of thy Lord verified upon them who do wickedly, that they believe not
10|34|Say, is there any of your companions who produceth a creature, and then causeth it to return unto Himself? Say, God produceth a creature, and then causeth it to return unto Himself. How therefore are ye turned aside from his worship
10|35|Say, is there any of your companions who directeth unto the truth? Say, God directeth unto the truth. Whether is he therefore, who directeth unto the truth, more worthy to be followed; or he who directeth not, unless he be directed? What aileth you therefore, that ye judge as ye do
10|36|And the greater part of them follow an uncertain opinion only; but a mere opinion attaineth not unto any truth. Verily God knoweth that which they do
10|37|This Koran could not have been composed by any except God; but it is a confirmation of that which was revealed before it, and an explanation of the scripture; there is no doubt thereof; sent down from the Lord of all creatures
10|38|Will they say, Mohammed hath forged it? Answer, bring therefore a chapter like unto it; and call whom ye may to your assistance, besides God, if ye speak truth
10|39|But they have charged that with falsehood, the knowledge whereof they do not comprehend, neither hath the interpretation thereof come unto them. In the same manner did those who were before them, accuse their prophets of imposture; but behold, what was the end of the unjust
10|40|There are some of them who believe therein; and there are some of them who believe not therein: And thy Lord well knoweth the corrupt doers
10|41|If they accuse thee of imposture, say, I have my work, and ye have your work; ye shall be clear of that which I do, and I will be clear of that which ye do
10|42|There are some of them who hearken unto thee; but wilt thou make the deaf to hear, although they do not understand
10|43|And there are some of them who look at thee; but wilt thou direct the blind, although they see not
10|44|Verily God will not deal unjustly with men in any respect: But men deal unjustly with their own souls
10|45|On a certain day He will gather them together, as though they had not tarried above an hour of a day: They shall know one another. Then shall they perish who have denied the meeting of God; and were not rightly directed
10|46|Whether We cause thee to see a part of the punishment wherewith We have threatened them, or whether We cause thee to die before thou see it; unto Us shall they return: Then shall God be witness of that which they do
10|47|Unto every nation hath an apostle been sent: And when their apostle came, the matter was decided between them with equity; and they were not treated unjustly
10|48|The unbelievers say, when will this threatening be made good, if ye speak truth
10|49|Answer, I am able neither to procure advantage unto my self, nor to avert mischief from me, but as God pleaseth. Unto every nation is a fixed term decreed; when their term therefore is expired, they shall not have respite for an hour, neither shall their punishment be anticipated
10|50|Say, tell me; if the punishment of God overtake you by night, or by day, what part thereof will the ungodly wish to be hastened
10|51|When it falleth on you, do ye then believe it? Now do ye believe, and wish it far from you, when ye formerly desired it should be hastened
10|52|Then shall it be said unto the wicked, taste ye the punishment of eternity: Would ye receive other than the reward of that which ye have wrought
10|53|They will desire to know of thee, whether this be true. Answer, yea, by my Lord, it is certainly true; neither shall ye weaken God's power, so as to escape it
10|54|Verily, if every soul which hath acted wickedly had whatever is on the earth, it would willingly redeem it self therewith at the last day. Yet they will conceal their repentance, after they shall have seen the punishment: And the matter shall be decided between them with equity; and they shall not be unjustly treated
10|55|Doth not whatsoever is in heaven and on earth belong unto God? Is not the promise of God true? But the greater part of them know it not
10|56|He giveth life, and He causeth to die; and unto Him shall ye all return
10|57|O men, now hath an admonition come unto you from your Lord, and a remedy for the doubts which are in your breasts; and a direction, and mercy unto the true believers
10|58|Say, through the grace of God, and his mercy: Therein therefore let them rejoice; this will be better than what they heap together of worldly riches
10|59|Say, tell me; of that which God hath sent down unto you for food, have ye declared part to be lawful, and other part to be unlawful? Say, hath God permitted you to make this distinction? Or do ye devise a lie concerning God
10|60|But what will be the opinion of those who devise a lie concerning God, on the day of the resurrection? Verily God is indued with beneficence towards mankind; but the greater part of them do not give thanks
10|61|Thou shalt be engaged in no business, neither shalt thou be employed in meditating on any passage of the Koran; nor shall ye do any action, but We will be witnesses over you, when ye are employed therein. Nor is so much as the weight of an ant hidden from thy Lord, in earth or in heaven: Neither is there any thing lesser than that, or greater, but it is written in the perspicuous book
10|62|Are not the friends of God the persons, on whom no fear shall come, and who shall not be grieved
10|63|They who believe and fear God
10|64|shall receive good tidings in this life, and in that which is to come. There is no change in the words of God. This shall be great felicity
10|65|Let not their discourse grieve thee; for all might belongeth unto God: He both heareth and knoweth
10|66|Is not whoever dwelleth in heaven and on earth, subject unto God? What therefore do they follow, who invoke idols, besides God? They follow nothing but a vain opinion; and they only utter lies
10|67|It is He who hath ordained the night for you, that ye may take your rest therein, and the clear day for labour: Verily herein are signs unto people who hearken
10|68|They say, God hath begotten children: God forbid! He is self-sufficient. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth: Ye have no demonstrative proof of this. Do ye speak of God that which ye know not
10|69|Say, verily they who imagine a lie concerning God, shall not prosper
10|70|They may enjoy a provision in this world; but afterwards unto Us shall they return, and We will then cause them to taste a grievous punishment, for that they were unbelievers
10|71|Rehearse unto them the history of Noah: When he said unto his people, O my people, if my standing forth among you, and my warning you of the signs of God, be grievous unto you; in God do I put my trust. Therefore lay your design against me, and assemble your false gods; but let not your design be carried on by you in the dark: Then come forth against me, and delay not
10|72|And if ye turn aside from my admonition, I ask not any reward of you for the same; I expect my reward from God alone, and I am commanded to be one of those who are resigned unto Him
10|73|But they accused him of imposture; wherefore We delivered him, and those who were with him in the ark, and We caused them to survive the flood, but We drowned those who charged our signs with falsehood. Behold therefore, what was the end of those who were warned by Noah
10|74|Then did We send, after him, apostles unto their respective people, and they came unto them with evident demonstrations: Yet they were not disposed to believe in that which they had before rejected as false. Thus do We seal up the hearts of the transgressors
10|75|Then did we send, after them, Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his princes with our signs: But they behaved proudly, and were a wicked people
10|76|And when the truth from Us had come unto them, they said, verily this is manifest sorcery
10|77|Moses said unto them, do ye speak this of the truth, after it hath come unto you? Is this sorcery? But sorcerers shall not prosper
10|78|They said, art thou come unto us to turn us aside from that religion, which we found our fathers practise; and that ye two may have the command in the land? But we do not believe you
10|79|And Pharaoh said, bring unto me every expert magician
10|80|And when the magicians were come, Moses said unto them, cast down that which ye are about to cast down
10|81|And when they had cast down their rods and cords, Moses said unto them, the enchantment which ye have performed, shall God surely render vain; for God prospereth not the work of the wicked doers
10|82|And God will verify the truth of his words, although the wicked be averse thereto
10|83|And there believed not any on Moses, except a generation of his people, for fear of Pharaoh and of his princes, lest he should afflict them. And Pharaoh was lifted up with pride in the earth, and was surely one of the transgressors
10|84|And Moses said, O my people, if ye believe in God, put your trust in Him, if ye be resigned to his will
10|85|They answered, we put our trust in God: O Lord, suffer us not to be afflicted by unjust people
10|86|but deliver us, through thy mercy, from the unbelieving people
10|87|And We spake by inspiration unto Moses and his brother, saying, provide habitations for your people in Egypt, and make your houses a place of worship, and be constant at prayer; and bear good news unto the true believers
10|88|And Moses said, O Lord, verily Thou hast given unto Pharaoh and his people pompous ornaments, and riches in this present life, O Lord, that they may be seduced from thy way: O Lord, bring their riches to nought, and harden their hearts; that they may not believe, until they see their grievous punishment
10|89|God said, your petition is heard: Be ye upright therefore, and follow not the way of those who are ignorant
10|90|And we caused the children of Israel to pass through the sea; and Pharaoh and his army followed them in a violent and hostile manner; until, when he was drowning, he said, I believe that there is no God but He, on whom the children of Israel believe; and I am one of the resigned
10|91|Now dost thou believe; when thou hast been hitherto rebellious, and one of the wicked doers
10|92|This day will We raise thy body from the bottom of the sea, that thou mayest be a sign unto those who shall be after thee; and verily a great number of men are negligent of our signs
10|93|And We prepared for the children of Israel an established dwelling in the land of Canaan, and We provided good things for their sustenance: And they differed not in point of religion, until knowledge had come unto them; verily thy Lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection, concerning that wherein they disagreed
10|94|If thou art in a doubt concerning any part of that which We have sent down unto thee, ask them who have read the book of the law before thee. Now hath the truth come unto thee from thy Lord; be not therefore one of those who doubt
10|95|Neither be thou one of those who charge the signs of God with falsehood, lest thou become one of those who perish
10|96|Verily those against whom the word of thy Lord is decreed, shall not believe
10|97|although there come unto them every kind of miracle; until they see the grievous punishment prepared for them
10|98|And if it were not so, some city, among the many which have been destroyed, would have believed; and the faith of its inhabitants would have been of advantage unto them: But none of them believed, before the execution of their sentence, except the people of Jonas. When they believed, We delivered them from the punishment of shame in this world, and suffered them to enjoy their lives and possessions for a time
10|99|But if they Lord had pleased, verily all who are in the earth would have believed in general. Wilt thou therefore forcibly compel men to be true believers
10|100|No soul can believe, but by the permission of God: And He shall pour out his indignation on those who will not understand
10|101|Say, consider whatever is in heaven and on earth: But signs are of no avail, neither preachers, unto people who will not believe
10|102|Do they therefore expect any other than some terrible judgment, like unto the judgments which have fallen on those who have gone before them? Say, wait ye the issue; and I also will wait with you
10|103|Then will We deliver our apostles and those who believe. Thus is it a justice due from Us, that We should deliver the true believers
10|104|Say, O men of Mecca, if ye be in doubt concerning my religion, verily I worship not the idols which ye worship, besides God; but I worship God, who will cause you to die: And I am commanded to be one of the true believers
10|105|And it was said unto me, set thy face towards the true religion, and be orthodox; and by no means be one of those who attribute companions unto God
10|106|neither invoke, besides God, that which can neither profit thee nor hurt thee: For if thou do, thou wilt then certainly become one of the unjust
10|107|If God afflict thee with hurt, there is none who can relieve thee from it, except He; and if He willeth thee any good, there is none who can keep back his bounty: He will confer it on such of his servants as He pleaseth; and He is gracious and merciful
10|108|Say, O men, now hath the truth come unto you from your Lord. He therefore who shall be directed, will be directed to the advantage of his own soul: But he who shall err, will err only against the same. I am no guardian over you
10|109|Do thou, O prophet, follow that which is revealed unto thee: And persevere with patience, until God shall judge; for He is the best judge
11|1|This book, the verses whereof are guarded against corruption, and are also distinctly explained, is a revelation from the wise, the knowing God
11|2|That ye serve not any other than God; -- verily I am a denouncer of threats, and a bearer of good tidings unto you from Him
11|3|and that ye ask pardon of your Lord, and then be turned unto Him. He will cause you to enjoy a plentiful provision, until a prefixed time: And unto every one that hath merit by good works, will He give his abundant reward. But if ye turn back, verily I fear for you the punishment of the great day
11|4|Unto God shall ye return; and He is almighty
11|5|Do they not double the folds of their breasts, that they may conceal their designs from him? When they cover themselves with their garments, doth not He know that which they conceal, and that which they discover? For He knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
11|6|There is no creature which creepeth on the earth, but God provideth its food; and He knoweth the place of its retreat, and where it is laid up. The whole is written in the perspicuous book of his decrees
11|7|It is He who hath created the heavens and the earth in six days, -- but his throne was above the waters before the creation thereof, -- that He might prove you, and see which of you would excel in works. If thou say, ye shall surely be raised again, after death; the unbelievers will say, this is nothing but manifest sorcery
11|8|And verily if We defer their punishment unto a determined season, they will say, what hindreth it from falling on us? Will it not come upon them on a day, wherein there shall be none to avert it from them; and that which they scoffed at shall encompass them
11|9|Verily, if We cause man to taste mercy from Us, and afterwards take it away from him; he will surely become desperate, and ungrateful
11|10|And if we cause him to taste favour, after an affliction hath befallen him, he will surely say, the evils which I suffered are passed from me; and he will become joyful and insolent
11|11|Except those who persevere with patience, and do that which is right; they shall receive pardon, and a great reward
11|12|Peradventure thou wilt omit to publish part of that which hath been revealed unto thee, and thy breast will become straitened, lest they say, unless a treasure be sent down unto him, or an angel come with him, to bear witness unto him, we will not believe. Verily thou art a preacher only; and God is the governor of all things
11|13|Will they say, he hath forged the Koran? Answer, bring therefore ten chapters like unto it, forged by your selves; and call on whomsoever ye may to assist you, except God, if ye speak truth
11|14|But if they whom ye call to your assistance hear you not; know that this book hath been revealed by the knowledge of God only, and that there is no God, but He. Will ye therefore become Moslems
11|15|Whoso chooseth the present life, and the pomp thereof, unto them will We give the recompense of their works therein, and the same shall not be diminished unto them
11|16|These are they for whom no other reward is prepared in the next life, except the fire of hell: That which they have done in this life shall perish; and that which they have wrought shall be vain
11|17|Shall he therefore be compared with them, who followeth the evident declaration of his Lord, and whom a witness from him attendeth, preceded by the book of Moses, which was revealed for a guide, and out of mercy to mankind? These believe in the Koran: But whosoever of the confederate infidels believeth not therein, is threatened with the fire of hell, which threat shall certainly be executed: Be not therefore in a doubt concerning it; for it is the truth from thy Lord: But the greater part of men will not believe
11|18|Who is more unjust than he who imagineth a lie concerning God? They shall be set before their Lord, at the day of judgment, and the witnesses shall say, these are they who devised lies against their Lord. Shall not the curse of God fall on the unjust
11|19|who turn men aside from the way of God, and seek to render it crooked, and who believe not in the life to come
11|20|These were not able to prevail against God on earth, so as to escape punishment; neither had they any protectors besides God: Their punishment shall be doubled unto them. They could not hear, neither did they see
11|21|These are they who have lost their souls; and the idols which they falsely imagined, have abandoned them
11|22|There is no doubt but they shall be most miserable in the world to come
11|23|But as for those who believe, and do good works, and humble themselves before their Lord, they shall be the inhabitants of paradise; they shall remain therein for ever
11|24|The similitude of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf, and as he who seeth and heareth: Shall they be compared as equal? Will ye not therefore consider
11|25|We formerly sent Noah unto his people; and he said, verily I am a public preacher unto you
11|26|that ye worship God alone: Verily I fear for you the punishment of the terrible day
11|27|But the chiefs of his people, who believed not, answered, we see thee to be no other than a man, like unto us; and we do not see that any follow thee, except those who are the most abject among us, who have believed on thee by a rash judgment; neither do we perceive any excellence in you above us: But we esteem you to be liars
11|28|Noah said, O my people, tell me; if I have received an evident declaration from my Lord, and He hath bestowed on me mercy from Himself, which is hidden from you, do we compel you to receive the same, in case ye be averse thereto
11|29|O my people, I ask not of you any riches, for my preaching unto you: My reward is with God alone. I will not drive away those who have believed: Verily they shall meet their Lord, at the resurrection; but I perceive that ye are ignorant men
11|30|O my people, who shall assist me against God, if I drive them away? Will ye not therefore consider
11|31|I say not unto you, the treasures of God are in my power; neither do I say, I know the secrets of God: Neither do I say, verily I am an angel; neither do I say of those whom your eyes do condemn, God will by no means bestow good on them: -- God best knoweth that which is in their souls; -- for then should I certainly be one of the unjust
11|32|They answered, O Noah, thou hast already disputed with us, and hast multiplied disputes with us; now therefore do thou bring that punishment upon us wherewith thou hast threatened us, if thou speakest truth
11|33|Noah said, verily God alone shall bring it upon you, if He pleaseth; and ye shall not prevail against Him, so as to escape the same
11|34|Neither shall my counsel profit you, although I endeavour to counsel you aright, if God shall please to lead you into error. He is your Lord, and unto Him shall ye return
11|35|Will the Meccans say, Mohammed hath forged the Koran? Answer, if I have forged it, on me be my guilt; and let me be clear of that which ye are guilty of
11|36|And it was revealed unto Noah, saying, verily none of thy people shall believe, except he who hath already believed: Be not therefore grieved, for that which they are doing
11|37|But make an ark in our presence, according to the form and dimensions which We have revealed unto thee: And speak not unto Me in behalf of those who have acted unjustly; for they are doomed to be drowned
11|38|And he built the ark; and so often as a company of his people passed by him, they derided him: But he said, though ye scoff at us now, we will scoff at you hereafter, as ye scoff at us
11|39|and ye shall surely know on whom a punishment shall be inflicted, which shall cover him with shame, and on whom a lasting punishment shall fall
11|40|Thus were they employed until our sentence was put in execution, and the oven poured forth water. And We said unto Noah, carry into the ark of every species of animals one pair; and thy family, -- except him on whom a previous sentence of destruction hath passed, -- and those who believe. But there believed not with him, except a few
11|41|And Noah said, embark thereon, in the name of God; while it moveth forward, and while it standeth still; for my Lord is gracious and merciful
11|42|And the ark swam with them between waves like mountains: And Noah called unto his son, who was separated from him, saying, embark with us, my son, and stay not with the unbelievers
11|43|He answered, I will get on a mountain, which will secure me from the water. Noah replied, there is no security this day from the decree of God, except for him on whom He shall have mercy. And a wave passed between them, and he became one of those who were drowned
11|44|And it was said, O earth, swallow up thy waters, and thou, O heaven, withhold thy rain. And immediately the water abated, and the decree was fulfilled, and the ark rested on the mountain Al Judi; and it was said, away with the ungodly people
11|45|And Noah called upon his Lord, and said, O Lord, verily my son is of my family; and thy promise is true: For thou art the most just of those who exercise judgment
11|46|God answered, O Noah, verily he is not of thy family: This intercession of thine for him, is not a righteous work. Ask not of me therefore that wherein thou hast no knowledge: I admonish thee that thou become not one of the ignorant
11|47|Noah said, O Lord, I have recourse unto Thee for the assistance of thy grace, that I ask not of Thee that wherein I have no knowledge: And unless thou forgive me, and be merciful unto me, I shall be one of those who perish
11|48|It was said unto him, O Noah, come down from the ark, with peace from us, and blessings upon thee, and upon a part of those who are with thee: But as for a part of them, We will suffer them to enjoy the provision of this world; and afterwards shall a grievous punishment from us be inflicted on them, in the life to come
11|49|This is a secret history, which we reveal unto thee: Thou didst not know it, neither did thy people, before this. Wherefore persevere with patience; for the prosperous issue shall attend the pious
11|50|And unto the tribe of Ad we sent their brother Hud. He said, O my people worship God; ye have no God besides him: Ye only imagine falsehood, in setting up idols and intercessors of your own making
11|51|O my people, I ask not of you for this my preaching, any recompense: My recompense do I expect from Him only, Who hath created me. Will ye not therefore understand
11|52|O my people, ask pardon of your Lord; and be turned unto Him: He will send the heaven to pour forth rain plentifully upon you, and He will increase your strength by giving unto you farther strength: Therefore turn not aside, to commit evil
11|53|They answered, O Hud, thou hast brought us no proof of what thou sayest; therefore we will not leave our gods for thy saying, neither do we believe thee
11|54|We say no other than that some of our gods have afflicted thee with evil. He replied, verily I call God to witness, and do ye also bear witness, that I am clear of that which ye associate with God
11|55|besides Him. Do ye all therefore join to devise a plot against me, and tarry not
11|56|for I put my confidence in God, my Lord and your Lord. There is no beast, but he holdeth it by its forelock: Verily my Lord proceedeth in the right way
11|57|But if ye turn back, I have already declared unto you that with which I was sent unto you; and my Lord shall substitute another nation in your stead; and ye shall not hurt him at all: For my Lord is guardian over all things
11|58|And when our sentence came to be put in execution, We delivered Hud, and those who had believed with him, through our mercy; and We delivered them from a grievous punishment
11|59|And this tribe of Ad wittingly rejected the signs of their Lord, and were disobedient unto his messengers, and they followed the command of every rebellious perverse person
11|60|Wherefore they were followed in this world by a curse, and they shall be followed by the same on the day of resurrection. Did not Ad disbelieve in their Lord? Was it not said, away with Ad, the people of Hud
11|61|And unto the tribe of Thamud we sent their brother Saleh. He said unto them, O my people, worship God; ye have no God besides Him. It is He who hath produced you out of the earth, and hath given you an habitation therein. Ask pardon of Him therefore, and be turned unto Him; for my Lord is near, and ready to answer
11|62|They answered, oh, thou wast a person on whom we placed our hopes before this. Dost thou forbid us to worship that which our fathers worshipped? But we are certainly in doubt concerning the religion to which thou dost invite us, as justly to be suspected
11|63|Saleh said, O my people, tell me; if I have received an evident declaration from my Lord, and He hath bestowed on me mercy from Himself; who will protect me from the vengeance of God, if I be disobedient unto Him? For ye shall not add unto me, other than loss
11|64|And he said, O my people, this she-camel of God is a sign unto you; therefore dismiss her freely that she may feed in God's earth, and do her no harm, lest a swift punishment seize you
11|65|Yet they killed her; and Saleh said, enjoy yourselves in your dwellings for three days; after which ye shall be destroyed. This is an infallible prediction
11|66|And when our decree came to be executed, we delivered Saleh and those who believed with him, through our mercy, also from the disgrace of that day; for thy Lord is the strong, the mighty God
11|67|But a terrible noise from heaven assailed those who had acted unjustly; and in the morning they were found in their houses, lying dead and prostrate
11|68|as though they had never dwelt therein. Did not Thamud disbelieve in their Lord? Was not Thamud cast far away
11|69|Our messengers also came formerly unto Abraham, with good tidings: They said, peace be upon thee. And he answered, and on you be peace! And he tarried not, but brought a roasted calf
11|70|And when he saw that their hands did not touch the meat, he misliked them, and entertained a fear of them. But they said, fear not: For we are sent unto the people of Lot
11|71|And his wife Sarah was standing by, and she laughed; and We promised her Isaac, and after Isaac, Jacob
11|72|She said, alas! Shall I bear a son, who am old; this my husband also being advanced in years? Verily this would be a wonderful thing
11|73|The angels answered, dost thou wonder at the effect of the command of God? The mercy of God and his blessings be upon you, the family of the house: For He is praiseworthy, and to be glorified
11|74|And when his apprehension had departed from Abraham, and the good tidings of Isaac's birth had come unto him, he disputed with us concerning the people of Lot
11|75|For Abraham was a pitiful, compassionate, and devout person
11|76|The angels said unto him, O Abraham, abstain from this; for now is the command of thy Lord come, to put their sentence in execution, and an inevitable punishment is ready to fall upon them
11|77|And when our messengers came unto Lot, he was troubled for them, and his arm was straitened concerning them, and he said, this is a grievous day
11|78|And his people came unto him, rushing upon him: And they had formerly been guilty of wickedness. Lot said unto them, O my people, these my daughters are more lawful for you: Therefore fear God, and put me not to shame by wronging my guests. Is there not a man of prudence among you
11|79|They answered, thou knowest that we have no need of thy daughters; and thou well knowest what we would have
11|80|He said, if I had strength sufficient to oppose you, or I could have recourse unto a powerful support; I would certainly do it
11|81|The angels said, O Lot, verily we are the messengers of thy Lord; they shall by no means come in unto thee. Go forth therefore with thy family, in some part of the night, and let not any of you turn back: But as for thy wife, that shall happen unto her, which shall happen unto them. Verily the prediction of their punishment shall be fulfilled in the morning: Is not the morning near
11|82|And when our command came, We turned those cities upside down, and We rained upon them stones of baked clay, one following another
11|83|and being marked, from thy Lord; and they are not far distant from those who act unjustly
11|84|And unto Madian We sent their brother Shoaib: He said, O my people, worship God; ye have no God but Him: And diminish not measure and weight. Verily I see you to be in a happy condition: But I fear for you the punishment of the day which will encompass the ungodly
11|85|O my people, give full measure, and just weight; and diminish not unto men ought of their matters; neither commit injustice in the earth, acting corruptly
11|86|The residue which shall remain unto you as the gift of God, after ye shall have done justice to others, will be better for you, than wealth gotten by fraud; if ye be true believers. I am no guardian over you
11|87|They answered, O Shoaib, do thy prayers enjoin thee, that we should leave the gods which our fathers worshipped; or that we should not do what we please with our substance? Thou only, it seems, art the wise person, and fit to direct
11|88|He said, O my people, tell me; if I have received an evident declaration from my Lord, and He hath bestowed on me an excellent provision, and I will not consent unto you in that which I forbid you; do I seek any other than your reformation, to the utmost of my power? My support is from God alone; on Him do I trust, and unto Him do I turn me
11|89|O my people, let not your opposing of me, draw on you a vengeance like unto that which fell on the people of Noah, or the people of Hud, or the people of Saleh: Neither was the people of Lot far distant from you
11|90|Ask pardon therefore of your Lord; and be turned unto him: For my Lord is merciful, and loving
11|91|They answered, O Shoaib, we understand not much of what thou sayest; and we see thee to be a man of no power among us: If it had not been for the sake of thy family, we had surely stoned thee, neither couldest thou have prevailed against us
11|92|Shoaib said, O my people, is my family more worthy in your opinion, than God? And do ye cast him behind you with neglect? Verily my Lord comprehendeth that which ye do
11|93|O my people, do ye work according to your condition; I will surely work according to my duty. And ye shall certainly know, on whom will be inflicted a punishment which shall cover him with shame, and who is a liar. Wait therefore the event; for I also will wait it with you
11|94|Wherefore when our decree came to be executed, we delivered Shoaib and those who believed with him, through our mercy: And a terrible noise from heaven assailed those who had acted unjustly; and in the morning they were found in their houses lying dead and prostrate
11|95|as though they had never dwelt therein. Was not Madian removed from off the earth, as Thamud had been removed
11|96|And we formerly sent Moses with our signs, and manifest power
11|97|unto Pharaoh and his princes: But they followed the command of Pharaoh; although the command of Pharaoh did not direct them aright
11|98|Pharaoh shall precede his people on the day of resurrection, and he shall lead them into hell fire; an unhappy way shall it be which they shall be led
11|99|They were followed in this life by a curse, and on the day of resurrection miserable shall be the gift which shall be given them
11|100|This is a part of the histories of the cities, which We rehearse unto thee. Of them there are some standing; and others which are utterly demolished
11|101|And We treated them not unjustly, but they dealt unjustly with their own souls: And their gods which they invoked, besides God, were of no advantage unto them at all, when the decree of thy Lord came to be executed on them, neither were they any other than a detriment unto them
11|102|And thus was the punishment of thy Lord inflicted, when He punished the cities which were unjust; for his punishment is grievous and severe
11|103|Verily herein is a sign unto him who feareth the punishment of the last day: That shall be a day, whereon all men shall be assembled, and that shall be a day whereon witness shall be born
11|104|We defer it not, but to a determined time
11|105|When that day shall come, no soul shall speak to excuse it self, or to intercede for another, but by the permission of God. Of them one shall be miserable, and another shall be happy
11|106|And they who shall be miserable, shall be thrown into hell fire; there shall they wail and bemoan themselves
11|107|They shall remain therein so long as the heavens and the earth shall endure; except what thy Lord shall please to remit of their sentence; for thy Lord effecteth that which He pleaseth
11|108|But they who shall be happy, shall be admitted into paradise; they shall remain therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure; besides what thy Lord shall please to add unto their bliss; a bounty which shall not be interrupted
11|109|Be not therefore in doubt concerning that which these men worship: They worship not other than what their fathers worshipped before them; and We will surely give them their full portion, not in the least diminished
11|110|We formerly gave unto Moses the book of the law; and disputes arose among his people concerning it: And unless a previous decree had proceeded from thy Lord, to bear with them during this life, the matter had been surely decided between them. And thy people are also jealous and in doubt concerning the Koran
11|111|But unto every one of them will thy Lord render the reward of their works; for He well knoweth that which they do
11|112|Be thou stedfast therefore, as thou hast been commanded; and let him also be stedfast who shall be converted with thee; and transgress not: For He seeth that which ye do
11|113|And incline not unto those who act unjustly, lest the fire of hell touch you: For ye have no protectors, except God; neither shall ye be assisted against Him
11|114|Pray regularly morning and evening; and in the former part of the night, for good works drive away evils. This is an admonition unto those who consider
11|115|Wherefore persevere with patience ; for God suffereth not the reward of the righteous to perish
11|116|Were such of the generations before you, indued with understanding and virtue, who forbad the acting corruptly in the earth, any more than a few only of those whom We delivered? But they who were unjust followed the delights which they enjoyed in this world, and were wicked doers
11|117|And thy Lord was not of such a disposition as to destroy the cities unjustly, while their inhabitants behaved themselves uprightly
11|118|And if thy Lord pleased, He would have made all men of one religion: But they shall not cease to differ among themselves
11|119|unless those on whom thy Lord shall have mercy: And unto this hath He created them; for the word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled, when He said, verily I will fill hell altogether with genii and men
11|120|The whole which we have related of the histories of our apostles do we relate unto thee, that we may confirm thy heart thereby; and herein is the truth come unto thee, and an admonition, and a warning unto the true believers
11|121|Say unto those who believe not, act ye according to your condition; we surely will act according to our duty
11|122|And wait the issue; for we certainly wait it also
11|123|Unto God is known that which is secret in heaven and earth; and unto Him shall the whole matter be referred. Therefore worship Him, and put thy trust in Him; for thy Lord is not regardless of that which ye do
12|1|These are the signs of the perspicuous book
12|2|which We have sent down in the Arabic tongue, that peradventure ye might understand
12|3|We relate unto thee a most excellent history, by revealing unto thee this Koran, whereas thou wast before one of the negligent
12|4|When Joseph said unto his father, O my father, verily I saw in my dream eleven stars, and the sun and the moon; I saw them make obeisance unto me
12|5|Jacob said, O my child, tell not thy vision to thy brethren, lest they devise some plot against thee; for the devil is a professed enemy unto man
12|6|And thus, according to thy dream, shall thy Lord choose thee, and teach thee the interpretation of dark sayings, and He shall accomplish his favour upon thee and upon the family of Jacob, as He hath formerly accomplished it upon thy fathers Abraham and Isaac; for thy Lord is knowing and wise
12|7|Surely in the history of Joseph and his brethren there are signs of God's providence to the inquisitive
12|8|when they said to one another, Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we, who are the greater number: Our father certainly maketh a wrong judgment
12|9|Wherefore slay Joseph, or drive him into some distant or desert part of the earth, and the face of your father shall be cleared towards you; and ye shall afterwards be people of integrity
12|10|One of them spoke and said; slay not Joseph, but throw him to the bottom of the well; and some travellers will take him up, if ye do this
12|11|They said unto Jacob, O father, why dost thou not intrust Joseph with us, since we are sincere well-wishers unto him
12|12|Send him with us to morrow, into the field, that he may divert himself, and sport, and we will be his guardians
12|13|Jacob answered, it grieveth me that ye take him away; and I fear lest the wolf devour him, while ye are negligent of him
12|14|They said, surely if the wolf devour him, when there are so many of us, we shall be weak indeed
12|15|And when they had carried him with them, and agreed to set him at the bottom of the well, they executed their design: And We sent a revelation unto him, saying, thou shalt hereafter declare this their action unto them; and they shall not perceive thee to be Joseph
12|16|And they came to their father at even, weeping
12|17|and said, father, we went and ran races with one another, and we left Joseph with our baggage, and the wolf hath devoured him; but thou wilt not believe us, although we speak the truth
12|18|And they produced his inner garment stained with false blood. Jacob answered, nay, but ye your selves have contrived the thing for your own sakes: However patience is most becoming, and God's assistance is to be implored to enable me to support the misfortune which ye relate
12|19|And certain travellers came, and sent one to draw water for them: And he let down his bucket, and said, good news! This is a youth. And they concealed him, that they might sell him as a piece of merchandize: but God knew that which they did
12|20|And they sold him for a mean price, for a few pence, and valued him lightly
12|21|And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife, use him honourably; peradventure he may be serviceable to us, or we may adopt him for our son. Thus did we prepare an establishment for Joseph in the earth, and we taught him the interpretation of dark sayings: For God is well able to effect his purpose; but the greater part of men do not understand
12|22|And when he had attained his age of strength, we bestowed on him wisdom, and knowledge; for thus do we recompense the righteous
12|23|And she, in whose house he was, desired him to lie with her; and she shut the doors and said, come hither. He answered, God forbid! Verily my lord hath made my dwelling with Him easy; and the ungrateful shall not prosper
12|24|But she resolved within her self to enjoy him, and he would have resolved to enjoy her, had he not seen the evident demonstration of his Lord. So We turned away evil and filthiness from him, because he was one of our sincere servants
12|25|And they ran to get one before the other to the door; and she rent his inner garment behind. And they met her lord at the door. She said, what shall be the reward of him who seeketh to commit evil in thy family, but imprisonment, and a painful punishment
12|26|And Joseph said, she asked me to lie with her. And a witness of her family bore witness, saying, if his garment be rent before, she speaketh truth, and he is a liar
12|27|But if his garment be rent behind, she lieth, and he is a speaker of truth
12|28|And when her husband saw that his garment was torn behind, he said, this is a cunning contrivance of your sex; for surely your cunning is great
12|29|O Joseph, take no farther notice of this affair: And thou, O woman, ask pardon for thy crime; for thou art a guilty person
12|30|And certain women said publicly in the city, the nobleman's wife asked her servant to lie with her: He hath inflamed her breast with his love; and we perceive her to be in a manifest error
12|31|And when she heard of their subtle behaviour, she sent unto them, and prepared a banquet for them, and she gave to each of them a knife; and she said unto Joseph, come forth unto them. And when they saw him, they praised him greatly; and they cut their own hands, and said, O God! This is not a mortal; he is not other than an angel, deserving the highest respect
12|32|And his mistress said, this is he, for whose sake ye blamed me: I asked him to lie with me, but he hath constantly refused. But if he do not perform that which I command him, he shall surely be cast into prison, and he shall be made one of the contemptible
12|33|Joseph said, O Lord, a prison is more eligible unto me than the crime to which they invite me; but unless thou turn aside their snares from me, I shall youthfully incline unto them, and I shall become one of the foolish
12|34|Wherefore his Lord heard him, and turned aside their snare from him, for He both heareth and knoweth
12|35|And it seemed good unto them even after they had seen the signs of his innocency, to imprison him for a time
12|36|And there entered into the prison with him two of the king's servants. One of them said, it seemed to me in my dream that I pressed wine out of grapes. And the other said, it seemed unto me in my dream that I carried bread on my head, whereof the birds did eat. Declare unto us the interpretation of our dreams, for we perceive that thou art a beneficent person
12|37|Joseph answered, no food, wherewith ye may be nourished, shall come unto you, but I will declare unto you the interpretation thereof, before it come unto you. This knowledge is a part of that which my Lord hath taught me: For I have left the religion of people who believe not in God, and who deny the life to come
12|38|and I follow the religion of my fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It is not lawful for us to associate any thing with God. This knowledge of the divine unity hath been given us of the bounty of God towards us, and towards mankind; but the greater part of men are not thankful
12|39|O my fellow-prisoners, are sundry lords better, or the only true and mighty God
12|40|Ye worship not, besides Him, other than the names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, concerning which God hath sent down no authoritative proof: Yet judgment belongeth unto God alone; who hath commanded that ye worship none besides Him. This is the right religion; but the greater part of men know it not
12|41|O my fellow-prisoners, verily the one of you shall serve wine unto his lord, as formerly; but the other shall be crucified, and the birds shall eat from off his head. The matter is decreed concerning which ye seek to be informed
12|42|And Joseph said unto him whom he judged to be the person who should escape of the two, remember me in the presence of thy lord. But the devil caused him to forget to make mention of Joseph unto his lord; wherefore he remained in the prison some years
12|43|And the king of Egypt said, verily I saw in my dream seven fat kine, which seven lean kine devoured, and seven green ears of corn, and other seven withered ears. O nobles, expound my vision unto me, if ye be able to interpret a vision
12|44|They answered, they are confused dreams; neither are we skilled in the interpretation of such kind of dreams
12|45|And Joseph's fellow-prisoner who had been delivered, said, (for he remembered Joseph after a certain space of time) I will declare unto you the interpretation thereof; wherefore let me go unto the person who will interpret it unto me
12|46|And he went to the prison, and said, O Joseph, thou man of veracity, teach us the interpretation of seven fat kine, which seven lean kine devourd, and of seven green ears of corn; and other seven withered ears, which the king saw in his dream; that I may return unto the men who have sent me, that peradventure they may understand the same
12|47|Joseph answered, ye shall sow seven years as usual: And the corn which ye shall reap, do ye leave in its ear, except a little whereof ye may eat
12|48|Then shall there come, after this, seven grievous years of famine, which shall consume what ye shall have laid up as a provision for the same, except a little which ye shall have kept
12|49|Then shall there come, after this, a year wherein men shall have plenty of rain, and wherein thay shall press wine and oil
12|50|And when the chief butler had reported this, the king said, bring him unto me. And when the messenger came unto Joseph, he said, return unto thy lord, and ask of him, what was the intent of the women who cut their hands; for my Lord well knoweth the snare which they laid for me
12|51|And when the women were assembled before the king, he said unto them, what was your design, when ye solicited Joseph to unlawful love? They answered, God be praise! We know not any ill of him. The nobleman's wife said, now is the truth become manifest: I solicited him, to lie with me; and he is one of those who speak truth
12|52|And when Joseph was acquainted therewith he said, this discovery hath been made, that my lord might know that I was not unfaithful unto him in his absence, and that God directeth not the plot of the deceivers
12|53|Neither do I absolutely justify my self: Since every soul is prone unto evil, except those on whom my Lord shall shew mercy; for my Lord is gracious and merciful
12|54|And the king said, bring him unto me: I will take him into my own peculiar service. And when Joseph was brought unto the king, and he had discoursed with him, he said, thou art this day firmly established with us, and shalt be intrusted with our affairs
12|55|Joseph answered, set me over the store-houses of the land; for I will be a skilful keeper thereof
12|56|Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that he might provide himself a dwelling therein, where he pleased. We bestow our mercy on whom We please, and We suffer not the reward of the righteous to perish
12|57|And certainly the reward of the next life is better, for those who believe, and fear God
12|58|Moreover Joseph's brethren came, and went in unto him; and he knew them, but they knew not him
12|59|And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he said, bring unto me your brother, the son of your father: Do ye not see that I give full measure, and that I am the most hospitable receiver of guests
12|60|But if ye bring him not unto me, there shall be no corn measured unto you from me, neither shall ye approach my presence
12|61|They answered, we will endeavour to obtain him of his father, and we will certainly perform what thou requirest
12|62|And Joseph said to his servants, put their money which they have paid for their corn, into their sacks, that they may perceive it, when they shall be returned to their family: Peradventure they will come back unto us
12|63|And when they were returned unto their father, they said, O father, it is forbidden to measure out corn unto us any more, unless we carry our brother Benjamin with us: Wherefore send our brother with us, and we shall have corn measured unto us; and we will certainly guard him from any mischance
12|64|Jacob answered, shall I trust him with you with any better success than I trusted your brother Joseph with you heretofore? But God is the best guardian; and He is the most merciful of those who shew mercy
12|65|And when they opened their provisions, they found their money had been returned unto them; and they said, O father, what do we desire farther? This our money hath been returned unto us: We will therefore return, and provide corn for our family: We will take care of our brother; and we shall receive a camel's burden more than we did the last time. This is a small quantity
12|66|Jacob said, I will by no means send him with you, until ye give me a solemn promise, and swear by God that ye will certainly bring him back unto me, unless ye be encompassed by some inevitable impediment. And when they had given him their solemn promise, he said, God is witness of what we say
12|67|And he said, my sons, enter not into the city by one and the same gate; but enter by different gates. But this precaution will be of no advantage unto you against the decree of God; for judgment belongeth unto God alone: In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let those confide who seek in whom to put their trust
12|68|And when they entered the city, as their father had commanded them, it was of no advantage unto them against the decree of God; and the same served only to satisfy the desire of Jacob's soul, which he had charged them to perform: For he was indued with knowledge of that which We had taught him; but the greater part of men do not understand
12|69|And when they entered into the presence of Joseph, he received his brother Benjamin as his guest, and said, verily I am thy brother: Be not therefore afflicted for that which they have committed against us
12|70|And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he put his cup in his brother Benjamin's sack. Then a cryer cried after them saying, O company of travellers, ye are surely thieves
12|71|They said, -- and turned back unto them, -- what is it that ye miss
12|72|They answered, we miss the prince's cup: And unto him who shall produce it, shall be given a camel's load of corn; and I will be surety for the same
12|73|Joseph's brethren replied, by God, ye do well know, that we come not to act corruptly in the land, neither are we thieves
12|74|The Egyptians said, what shall be the reward of him, who shall appear to have stolen the cup, if ye be found liars
12|75|Joseph's brethren answered, as to the reward of him, in whose sack it shall be found, let him become a bondman in satisfaction for the same: Thus do we reward the unjust, who are guilty of theft
12|76|Then he began by their sacks, before he searched the sack of his brother; and he drew out the cup from his brother's sack. Thus did we furnish Joseph with a stratagem. It was not lawful for him to take his brother for a bondman, by the law of the king of Egypt, had not God pleased to allow it, according to the offer of his brethren. We exalt to degrees of knowledge and honour whom we please: And there is one who is knowing above all those who are indued with knowledge
12|77|His brethren said, if Benjamin be guilty of theft, his brother Joseph hath been also guilty of theft heretofore. But Joseph concealed these things in his mind, and did not discover them unto them: And he said within himself, ye are in a worse condition than us two; and God best knoweth what ye discourse about
12|78|They said unto Joseph, noble lord, verily this lad hath an aged father; wherefore take one of us in his stead; for we perceive that thou art a beneficent person
12|79|Joseph answered, God forbid that we should take any other than him with whom we found our goods; for then should we certainly be unjust
12|80|And when they despaired of obtaining Benjamin, they retired to confer privately together. And the elder of them said, do ye not know that your father hath received a solemn promise from you, in the name of God; and how perfidiously ye behaved heretofore towards Joseph? Wherefore I will by no means depart the land of Egypt, until my father give me leave to return unto him, or God maketh known his will to me; for he is the best judge
12|81|Return ye to your father, and say, O father, verily thy son hath committed theft; we bear witness of no more than what we know, and we could not guard against what we did not foresee
12|82|And do thou inquire in the city, where we have been, and of the company of merchants, with whom we are arrived, and thou wilt find that we speak the truth
12|83|And when they were returned, and had spoken thus to their father, he said, nay but rather ye your selves have contrived the thing for your own sakes: But patience is most proper for me; peradventure God will restore them all unto me; for he is knowing and wise
12|84|And he turned from them and said, oh how am I grieved for Joseph! And his eyes became white with mourning, he being oppressed with deep sorrow
12|85|His sons said, by God, thou wilt not cease to remember Joseph, until thou be brought to death's door, or thou be actually destroyed by excessive affliction
12|86|He answered, I only represent my grief, which I am not able to contain, and my sorrow unto God; but I know by revelation from God that which ye know not
12|87|O my sons, go and make inquiry after Joseph and his brother; and despair not of the mercy of God; for none despaireth of God's mercy, except the unbelieving people
12|88|Wherefore Joseph's brethren returned into Egypt: And when they came into his presence they said, noble lord, the famine is felt by us and our family, and we are come with a small sum of money: Yet give unto us full measure, and bestow corn upon us as alms; for God rewardeth the alms-givers
12|89|Joseph said unto them, do ye know what ye did unto Joseph and his brother, when ye were ignorant of the consequences thereof
12|90|They answered, art thou really Joseph? He replied, I am Joseph; and this is my brother. Now hath God been gracious unto us. For whoso feareth God, and persevereth with patience, shall at length find relief; since God will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish
12|91|They said, by God, now hath God chosen thee above us; and we have surely been sinners
12|92|Joseph answered, let there be no reproach cast on you this day. God forgiveth you; for he is the most merciful of those who shew mercy
12|93|Depart ye with this my inner garment, and throw it on my fathers's face; and he shall recover his sight: And then come unto me with all your family
12|94|And when the company of travellers was departed from Egypt on their journey towards Canaan, their father said unto those who were about him, verily I perceive the smell of Joseph: Although ye think that I dote
12|95|They answered, by God, thou art in thy old mistake
12|96|But when the messenger of good tidings was come with Joseph's inner garment, he threw it over his face; and he recovered his eye-sight. And Jacob said, did I not tell you that I knew from God, that which ye knew not
12|97|They answered, O father, ask pardon of our sins for us, for we have surely been sinners
12|98|He replied, I will surely ask pardon for you of my Lord; for He is gracious and merciful
12|99|And when Jacob and his family arrived in Egypt, and were introduced unto Joseph, he received his parents unto him, and said, enter ye into Egypt, by God's favour, in full security
12|100|And he raised his parents to the seat of state, and they, together with his brethren, fell down and did obeisance unto him. And he said, O my father, this is the interpretation of my vision, which I saw heretofore: Now hath my Lord rendered it true. And He hath surely been gracious unto me, since He took me forth from the prison, and hath brought you hither from the desert; after that the devil had sown discord between me and my brethren: For my Lord is gracious unto whom He pleaseth; and He is the knowing, the wise God
12|101|O Lord, Thou hast given me a part of the kingdom, and hast taught me the interpretation of dark sayings. The Creator of heaven and earth! Thou art my protector in this world, and in that which is to come: Make me to die a Moslem, and join me with the righteous
12|102|This is a secret history, which We reveal unto thee, O Mohammed, although thou wast not present with the brethren of Joseph, when they concerted their design, and contrived a plot against him
12|103|But the greater part of men, although thou earnestly desire it, will not believe
12|104|Thou shalt not demand of them any reward for thy publishing the Koran; it is no other than an admonition unto all creatures
12|105|And how many signs soever there be of the being, unity, and providence of God, in the heavens and the earth; they will pass by them, and will retire afar off from them
12|106|And the greater part of them believe not in God, without being also guilty of idolatry
12|107|Do they not believe that some overwhelming affliction shall fall on them, as a punishment from God; or that the hour of judgment shall overtake them suddenly, while they consider not its approach
12|108|Say unto those of Mecca, this is my way: I invite you unto God, by an evident demonstration; both I and he who followeth me; and, praise be unto God! I am not an idolater
12|109|We sent not any apostles before thee, except men, unto whom We revealed our will, and whom We chose out of those who dwelt in cities. Will they not go through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who have preceded them. But the dwelling of the next life shall surely be better for those who fear God. Will they not therefore understand
12|110|Their predecessors were born with for a time, until, when our apostles despaired of their conversion, and they thought that they were liars, our help came unto them, and We delivered whom We pleased; but our vengeance was not turned away from the wicked people
12|111|Verily in the histories of the prophets and their people there is an instructive example unto those who are indued with understanding. The Koran is not a new invented fiction; but a confirmation of those scriptures which have been revealed before it, and a distinct explication of every thing necessary, in respect either to faith or practice, and a direction and mercy unto people who believe
13|1|These are the signs of the book of the Koran: And that which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord, is the truth; but the greater part of men will not believe
13|2|It is God who hath raised the heavens without visible pillars; and then ascended his throne, and compelled the sun and the moon to perform their services: Every of the heavenly bodies runneth an appointed course. He ordereth all things. He sheweth his signs distinctly, that ye may be assured ye must meet your Lord at the last day
13|3|It is He who hath stretched forth the earth, and placed therein stedfast mountains, and rivers; and hath ordained therein of every fruit two different kinds. He causeth the night to cover the day. Herein are certain signs unto people who consider
13|4|And in the earth are tracts of land of different natures, though bordering on each other; and also vineyards, and seeds, and palm-trees springing several from the same root, and singly from distinct roots. They are watered with the same water, yet We render some of them more excellent than others to eat. Herein are surely signs unto people who understand
13|5|If thou dost wonder at the infidels denying the resurrection, surely wonderful is their saying, after We shall have been reduced to dust, shall We be restored in a new creature? These are they who believe not in their Lord; these shall have collars on their necks, and these shall be the inhabitants of hell fire: Therein shall they abide for ever
13|6|They will ask of thee to hasten evil rather than good: Although there have already been examples of the divine vengeance before them. Thy Lord is surely indued with indulgence towards men, notwithstanding their iniquity; but thy Lord is also severe in punishing
13|7|The infidels say, unless a sign be sent down unto him from his Lord, we will not believe. Thou art commissioned to be a preacher only, and not a worker of miracles: And unto every people hath a director been appointed
13|8|God knoweth what every female beareth in her womb; and what the wombs want or exceed of their due time, or number of young. With him is every thing regulated according to a determined measure
13|9|He knoweth that which is hidden, and that which is revealed. He is the great, the most high
13|10|He among you who concealeth his words, and he who proclaimeth them in public; he also who seeketh to hide himself in the night, and he who goeth forth openly in the day, is equal in respect to the knowledge of God
13|11|Each of them hath angels mutually succeeding each other, before him, and behind him; they watch him by the command of God. Verily God will not change his grace which is in men, until they change the disposition in their souls by sin. When God willeth evil on a people, there shall be none to avert it; neither shall they have any protector beside Him
13|12|It is He who causeth the lightening to appear unto you, to strike fear, and to raise hope, and Who formeth the pregnant clouds
13|13|The thunder celebrateth his praise, and the angels also, for fear of Him. He sendeth his thunderbolts, and striketh therewith whom He pleaseth, while they dispute concerning God; for He is mighty in power
13|14|It is He who ought of right to be invoked; and the idols which they invoke besides Him, shall not hear them at all; otherwise than as he is heard, who stretcheth forth his hands to the water that it may ascend to his mouth, when it cannot ascend thither: The supplication of the unbelievers is utterly erroneous
13|15|Whatsoever is in heaven and on earth worshippeth God, voluntarily or of force; and their shadows also, morning and evening
13|16|Say, who is the Lord of heaven and earth? Answer, God. Say, have ye therefore taken unto yourselves protectors beside Him, who are unable either to help, or to defend themselves from hurt? Say, shall the blind and the seeing be esteemed equal? Or shall darkness and light be accounted the same? Or have they attributed companions unto God who have created as He hath created, so that their creation bear any resemblance unto His? Say, God the creator of all things; he is the one, the victorious God
13|17|He causeth water to descend from heaven, and the brooks flow according to their respective measure, and the floods bear the floating froth: And from the metals which they melt in the fire, seeking to cast ornaments or vessels for use, there ariseth a scum like unto it: Thus God setteth forth truth and vanity. But the scum is thrown off, and that which is useful to mankind remaineth on the earth. Thus doth God put forth parables
13|18|Unto those who obey their Lord, shall be given the most excellent reward: But those who obey Him not, although they were possessed of whatever is in the whole earth and as much more, they would give it all for their ransom. These will be brought to a terrible account: Their abode shall be hell; an unhappy couch shall it be
13|19|Shall he therefore, who knoweth that what hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord, is truth, be rewarded as he who is blind? The prudent only will consider
13|20|who fulfil the covenant of God, and break not their contract
13|21|and who join that which God hath commanded to be joined, and who fear their Lord, and dread an ill account
13|22|and who persevere out of a sincere desire to please their Lord, and observe the stated times of prayer, and give alms out of what We have bestowed on them, in secret and openly, and who turn away evil with good: The reward of these shall be paradise
13|23|gardens of eternal abode, which they shall enter, and also whoever shall have acted uprightly, of their fathers, and their wives, and their posterity: And the angels shall go in unto them by every gate, saying
13|24|peace be upon you, because ye have endured with patience; how excellent a reward is paradise
13|25|But as for those who violate the covenant of God, after the establishment thereof, and who cut in sunder that which God hath commanded to be joined, and act corruptly in the earth, on them shall a curse fall, and they shall have a miserable dwelling in hell
13|26|God giveth provision in abundance unto whom He pleaseth, and is sparing unto whom He pleaseth. Those of Mecca rejoice in the present life; although the present life, in respect of the future, is but a precarious provision
13|27|The infidels say, unless a sign be sent down unto him from his Lord, we will not believe. Answer, verily God will lead into error whom He pleaseth, and will direct unto Himself him who repenteth
13|28|and those who believe, and whose hearts rest securely in the meditation of God; shall not mens hearts rest securely in the meditation of God
13|29|They who believe and do that which is right shall enjoy blessedness, and partake of a happy resurrection
13|30|Thus have We sent thee to a nation which other nations have preceded, unto whom prophets have likewise been sent, that thou mayest rehearse unto them that which We have revealed unto thee, even while they believe not in the merciful God. Say unto them, He is my Lord; there is no God but He: In him do I trust, and unto Him must I return
13|31|Though a Koran were revealed by which mountains should be removed, or the earth cleaved in sunder, or the dead be caused to speak, it would be in vain. But the matter belongeth wholly unto God. Do not therefore the believers know, that if God pleased, He would certainly direct all men? Adversity shall not cease to afflict the unbelievers for that which they have committed, or to sit down near their habitations, until God's promise come: For God is not contrary to the promise
13|32|Apostles before thee have been laughed to scorn; and I permitted the infidels to enjoy a long and happy life: But afterwards I punished them; and how severe was the punishment which I inflicted on them
13|33|Who is it therefore that standeth over every soul, to observe that which it committeth? They attribute companions unto God. Say, name them: Will ye declare unto Him that which He knoweth not in the earth? Or will ye name them in outward speech only? But the deceitful procedure of the infidels was prepared for them; and they are turned aside from the right path: For he whom God shall cause to err, shall have no director
13|34|They shall suffer a punishment in this life; but the punishment of the next shall be more grievous: And there shall be none to protect them against God
13|35|This is the description of paradise, which is promised to the pious. It is watered by rivers; its food is perpetual, and its shade also: This shall be the reward of those who fear God. But the reward of the infidels shall be hell fire
13|36|Those to whom We have given the scriptures, rejoice at what hath been revealed unto thee. Yet there are some of the confederates who deny part thereof. Say unto them, verily I am commanded to worship God alone; and to give Him no companion: Upon Him do I call, and unto Him shall I return
13|37|To this purpose have We sent down the Koran, a rule of judgment, in the Arabic language. And verily if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, there shall be none to defend or protect thee against God
13|38|We have formerly sent apostles before thee, and bestowed on them wives and children; and no apostle had the power to come with a sign, unless by the permission of God. Every age hath its book of revelation
13|39|God shall abolish and shall confirm what he pleaseth. With Him is the original of the book
13|40|Moreover, whether We cause thee to see any part of that punishment wherewith we have threatened them, or whether We cause thee to die before it be inflicted on them, verily unto thee belongeth preaching only, but unto us inquisition
13|41|Do they not see that We come into their land, and straiten the borders thereof, by the conquests of the true believers? When God judgeth, there is none to reverse his judgment; and He will be swift in taking an account
13|42|Their predecessors formerly devised subtle plots against their prophets; but God is master of every subtle device. He knoweth that which every soul deserveth: And the infidels shall surely know, whose will be the reward of paradise
13|43|The unbelievers will say, thou art not sent of God. Answer, God is a sufficient witness between me and you, and he who understandeth the scriptures
14|1|This book have We sent down unto thee, that thou mayest lead men forth from darkness into light, by the permission of their Lord, into the glorious and laudable way
14|2|God is He unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth: And woe be to the infidels, because a grievous punishment waiteth them
14|3|who love the present life above that which is to come, and turn men aside from the way of God, and seek to render it crooked: These are in an error far distant from the truth
14|4|We have sent no apostle but with the language of his people, that he might declare their duty plainly unto them: For God causeth to err whom He pleaseth, and directeth whom He pleaseth; and He is the mighty, the wise
14|5|We formerly sent Moses with our signs, and commanded him saying, lead forth thy people from darkness into light, and remind them of the favours of God: Verily therein are signs unto every patient and grateful person
14|6|And call to mind when Moses said unto his people, remember the favour of God towards you, when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They grievously oppressed you, and they slew your male children, but let your females live: Therein was a great trial from your Lord
14|7|And when your Lord declared by the mouth of Moses, saying, if ye be thankful, I will surely increase my favours towards you; but if ye be ungrateful, verily my punishment shall be severe
14|8|And Moses said, if ye be ungrateful, and all who are in the earth likewise; verily God needeth not your thanks, though He deserveth the highest praise
14|9|Hath not the history of the nations your predecessors reached you; namely, of the people of Noah, and of Ad, and of Thamud, and of those who succeeded them; whose number none knoweth except God? Their apostles came unto them with evident miracles; but they clapped their hands to their mouths out of indignation, and said, we do not believe the message with which ye pretend to be sent; and we are in a doubt concerning the religion to which ye invite us, as justly to be suspected
14|10|Their apostles answered, is there any doubt concerning God, the creator of heaven and earth? He inviteth you to the true faith that He may forgive you part of your sins, and may respite your punishment, by granting you space to repent, until an appointed time. They answered, ye are but men, like unto us: Ye seek to turn us aside from the gods which our fathers worshipped; wherefore bring us an evident demonstration by some miracle, that ye speak truth
14|11|Their apostles replied unto them, we are no other than men like unto you; but God is bountiful unto such of his servants as He pleaseth: And it is not in our power to give you a miraculous demonstration of our mission, unless by the permission of God; in God therfore let the faithful trust
14|12|And what excuse have we to allege, that we should not put our trust in God; since He hath directed us our paths? Wherefore we will certainly suffer with patience the persecution wherewith ye shall afflict us: In God therefore let those put their confidence who seek in whom to put their trust
14|13|And those who believed not, said unto their apostles, we will surely expel you out of our land; or ye shall return unto our religion. And their Lord spake unto them by revelation, saying, We will surely destroy the wicked doers
14|14|and We will cause you to dwell in the earth, after them. This shall be granted unto him who shall dread the appearance at my tribunal, and shall fear my threatening
14|15|And they asked assistance of God, and every rebellious perverse person failed of success
14|16|Hell lieth unseen before him, and he shall have filthy water given him to drink
14|17|He shall sup it up by little and little, and he shall not easily let it pass his throat, because of its nauseousness; death also shall come upon him from every quarter, yet he shall not die; and before him shall there stand prepared a grievous torment
14|18|This is the likeness of those who believe not in their Lord. Their works are as ashes, which the wind violently scattereth in a stormy day: They shall not be able to obtain any solid advantage from that which they have wrought. This is an error most distant from truth
14|19|Dost thou not see that God hath created the heavens and the earth in wisdom? If He please, he can destroy you, and produce a new creature in your stead
14|20|Neither will this be difficult with God
14|21|And they shall all come forth into the presence of God at the last day: And the weak among them shall say unto those who behaved themselves arrogantly, verily we were your followers on earth; will ye not therefore avert from us some part of the divine vengeance? They shall answer, if God had directed us aright, we had certainly directed you. It is equal unto us whether we bear our torments impatiently, or whether we endure them with patience: For we have no way to escape
14|22|And Satan shall say, after judgment shall have been given, verily God promised you a promise of truth: And I also made you a promise; but I deceived you. Yet I had not any power over you to compel you; but I called you only, and ye answered me: Wherefore accuse not me, but accuse your selves. I cannot assist you; neither can ye assist me. Verily I do now renounce your having associated me with God heretofore. A grievous punishment is prepared for the unjust
14|23|But they who shall have believed and wrought righteousness, shall be introduced into gardens, wherein rivers flow; they shall remain therein for ever, by the permission of their Lord; and their salutation therein shall be, Peace
14|24|Dost thou not see how God putteth forth a parable; representing a good word, as a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed in the earth, and whose branches reach unto heaven
14|25|which bringeth forth its fruit in all seasons, by the will of its Lord? God propoundeth parables unto men, that they may be instructed
14|26|And the likeness of an evil word is as an evil tree; which is torn up from the face of the earth, and hath no stability
14|27|God shall confirm them who believe, by the stedfast word of faith, both in this life and in that which is to come: But God shall lead the wicked into error; for God doth that which He pleaseth
14|28|Hast thou not considered those who have changed the grace of God to infidelity, and cause their people to descend into the house of perdition
14|29|namely, into hell? They shall be thrown to burn therein; and an unhappy dwelling shall it be
14|30|They also set up idols as copartners with God, that they might cause men to stray from his path. Say unto them, enjoy the pleasures of this life for a time; but your departure hence shall be into hell fire
14|31|Speak unto my servants who have believed, that they be assiduous at prayer, and give alms out of that which We have bestowed on them, both privately and in public; before the day cometh, wherein there shall be no buying nor selling, neither any friendship
14|32|It is God who hath created the heavens and the earth; and causeth water to descend from heaven, and by means thereof produceth fruits for your sustenance: And by his command He obligeth the ships to sail in the sea for your service; and He also forceth the rivers to supply your uses
14|33|He likewise compelleth the sun and the moon, which diligently perform their courses, to serve you; and hath subjected the day and the night to your service
14|34|He giveth you of every thing which ye ask him; and of ye attempt to reckon up the favours of God, ye shall not be able to compute the same. Surely man is unjust and ungrateful
14|35|Remember when Abraham said, O Lord, make this land a place of security; and grant that I and my children may avoid the worship of idols
14|36|for they, O Lord, have seduced a great number of men. Whoever therefore shall follow me, he shall be of me: And whosoever shall disobey me; verily thou wilt be gracious and merciful
14|37|O Lord, I have caused some of my offspring to settle in an unfruitful valley, near thy holy house, O Lord, that they may be constant at prayer. Grant, therefore, that the hearts of some men may be affected with kindness towards them; and do thou bestow on them all sorts of fruits; that they may give thanks
14|38|O Lord, thou knowest whatsoever we conceal, and whatsoever we publish; for nothing is hidden from God, either on earth, or in heaven
14|39|Praise be unto God, who hath given me, in my old age Ismael and Isaac: For my Lord is the hearer of supplication
14|40|O Lord, grant that I may be an observer of prayer, and a part of my posterity also, O Lord, and receive my supplication
14|41|O Lord, forgive me, and my parents, and the faithful, on the day whereon an account shall be taken
14|42|Think not, O prophet, that God is regardless of what the ungodly do. He only deferreth their punishment unto the day whereon mens eyes shall be fixed
14|43|They shall hasten forward, at the voice of the angel calling to judgment, and shall lift up their heads; they shall not be able to turn their sight from the object whereon it shall be fixed, and their hearts shall be void of sense, through excessive terror
14|44|Wherefore do thou threaten men with the day, whereon their punishment shall be inflicted on them, and whereon those who have acted unjustly shall say, O Lord, give us respite unto a term near at hand; and we will obey thy call, and we will follow thy apostles. But it shall be answered unto them, did ye not swear heretofore, that no reverse should befall you
14|45|Yet ye dwelt in the dwellings of those who had treated their own souls unjustly; and it appeared plainly unto you how We had dealt with them; and We propounded their destruction as examples unto you
14|46|They employ their utmost subtlety to oppose the truth; but their subtlety is apparent unto God, who is able to frustrate their designs; although their subtlety were so great, that the mountains might be moved thereby
14|47|Think not therefore, O prophet, that God will be contrary to his promise of assistance, made unto his apostles; for God is mighty, able to avenge
14|48|The day will come, when the earth shall be changed into another earth, and the heavens into other heavens; and men shall come forth from their graves to appear before the only, the mighty God
14|49|And thou shalt see the wicked on that day bound together in fetters
14|50|Their inner garments shall be of pitch, and fire shall cover their faces
14|51|that God may reward every soul, according to what it shall have deserved; for God is swift in taking an account
14|52|This is a sufficient admonition unto men, that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that there is but one God; and that those who are indued with understanding may consider
15|1|These are the signs of the book, and of the perspicuous Koran
15|2|The time may come when the unbelievers shall wish that they had been Moslems
15|3|Suffer them to eat, and to enjoy themselves in this world; and let hope entertain them: But they shall hereafter know their folly
15|4|We have not destroyed any city, but a fixed term of repentance was appointed them
15|5|No nation shall be punished before their time shall be come; neither shall they be respited after
15|6|The Meccans say, O thou to whom the admonition hath been sent down, thou art certainly possessed with a devil
15|7|Wouldest thou not have come unto us with an attendance of angels, if thou hadst spoken truth
15|8|Answer, we send not down the angels, unless on a just occasion; nor should they be then respited any longer
15|9|We have surely sent down the Koran; and We will certainly preserve the same from corruption
15|10|We have heretofore sent apostles before thee, among the ancient sects
15|11|And there came no apostle unto them, but they laughed him to scorn
15|12|In the same manner will we put it into the hearts of the wicked Meccans to scoff at their prophet
15|13|They shall not believe on him; and the sentence of the nations of old hath been executed heretofore
15|14|If We should open a gate in the heaven above them, and they should ascend thereto all the day long
15|15|they would surely say, our eyes are only dazzled; or rather we are a people deluded by enchantments
15|16|We have placed the twelve signs in the heaven, and have set them out in various figures, for the observation of spectators
15|17|And we guard them from every devil driven away with stones
15|18|except him who listeneth by stealth, at whom a visible flame is darted
15|19|We have also spread forth the earth, and thrown thereon stable mountains; and we have caused every kind of vegetable to spring forth in the same, according to a determinate weight
15|20|And we have provided therein necessaries of life for you, and for him whom ye do not sustain
15|21|There is no one thing but the store-houses thereof are in our hands; and We distribute not the same otherwise than in a determinate measure
15|22|We also send the winds driving the pregnant clouds, and We send down from heaven water, whereof We give you to drink, and which ye keep not in store
15|23|Verily we give life, and We put to death; and We are the heirs of all things
15|24|We know those among you who go before; and We know those who stay behind
15|25|And thy Lord shall gather them together at the last day; for he is knowing and wise
15|26|We created man of dried clay, of black mud, formed into shape
15|27|And We had before created the devil of subtile fire
15|28|And remember when thy Lord said unto the angels, verily I am about to create man of dried clay, of black mud, wrought into shape
15|29|when therefore I shall have completely formed him, and shall have breathed of my spirit into him; do ye fall down and worship him
15|30|And all the angels worshipped Adam together
15|31|except Eblis, who refused to be with those who worshipped him
15|32|And God said unto him, O Eblis, what hindered thee from being with those who worshipped Adam
15|33|He answered, it is not fit that I should worship man, whom thou hast created of dried clay, of black mud, wrought into shape
15|34|God said, get thee therefore hence; for thou shalt be driven away with stones
15|35|And a curse shall be on thee, until the day of judgment
15|36|The devil said, O Lord, give me respite until the day of resurrection
15|37|God answered, verily thou shalt be one of those who are respited
15|38|until the day of the appointed time
15|39|The devil replied, O Lord, because thou hast seduced me, I will surely tempt them to disobedience in the earth; and I will seduce them all
15|40|except such of them as shall be thy chosen servants
15|41|God said, this is the right way with me
15|42|Verily as to my servants, thou shalt have no power over them; but over those only who shall be seduced, and who shall follow thee
15|43|And hell is surely denounced unto them all
15|44|It hath seven gates; unto every gate a distinct company of them shall be assigned
15|45|But those who fear God shall dwell in gardens, amidst fountains
15|46|The angels shall say unto them, enter ye therein in peace and security
15|47|And we will remove all grudges from their breasts; they shall be as brethren, sitting over against one another on couches
15|48|Weariness shall not affect them therein, neither shall they be cast out thence for ever
15|49|Declare unto my servants that I am the gracious, the merciful God
15|50|and that my punishment is a grievous punishment
15|51|And relate unto them the history of Abraham's guests
15|52|When they went in unto him, and said, peace be unto thee; he answered, verily we are afraid of you
15|53|And they replied, fear not; we bring thee the promise of a wise son
15|54|He said, do ye bring me the promise of a son now old age hath overtaken me? What is it therefore that ye tell me
15|55|They said, we have told thee the truth; be not therefore one of those who despair
15|56|He answered, and who despaireth of the mercy of God, except those who err
15|57|And he said, what is your errand therefore, O messengers of God
15|58|They answered, verily we are sent to destroy a wicked people
15|59|But as for the family of Lot, we will save them all
15|60|except his wife; we have decreed that she shall be one of those who remain behind to be destroyed with the infidels
15|61|And when the messengers came to the family of Lot
15|62|he said unto them, verily ye are people who are unknown to me
15|63|They answered, but we are come unto thee to execute that sentence, concerning which your fellow citizens doubted
15|64|We tell thee a certain truth; and we are messengers of veracity
15|65|Therefore lead forth thy family, in some time of the night; and do thou follow behind them, and let none of you turn back; but go whither ye are commanded
15|66|And We gave him this command; because the utmost remnant of those people was to be cut off in the morning
15|67|And the inhabitants of the city came unto Lot, rejoicing at the news of the arrival of some strangers
15|68|And he said unto them, verily these are my guests: Wherefore do not disgrace me by abusing them
15|69|but fear God, and put me not to shame
15|70|They answered, have we not forbidden thee from entertaining or protecting any man
15|71|Lot replied, these are my daughters; therefore rather make use of them, if ye be resolved to do what ye purpose
15|72|As thou livest they wander in their folly
15|73|Wherefore a terrible storm from heaven assailed them at sun-rise
15|74|And We turned the city upside down; and We rained on them stones of baked clay
15|75|Verily herein are signs unto men of sagacity
15|76|And those cities were punished, to point out a right way for men to walk in
15|77|Verily herein is a sign unto the true believers
15|78|The inhabitants of the wood near Midian were also ungodly
15|79|Wherefore We took vengeance on them. And both of them were destroyed, to serve as a manifest rule for men to direct their actions by
15|80|And the inhabitants of Al Hejr likewise heretofore accused the messengers of God of imposture
15|81|And We produced our signs unto them, but they retired afar off from the same
15|82|And they hewed houses out of mountains, to secure themselves
15|83|But a terrible noise from heaven assailed them in the morning
15|84|Neither was what they had wrought of any advantage unto them
15|85|We have not created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is contained between them, otherwise than in justice: And the hour of judgment shall surely come. Wherefore, O Mohammed, forgive thy people with a gracious forgiveness
15|86|Verily thy Lord is the creator of thee and of them, and knoweth what is most expedient
15|87|We have already brought unto thee seven verses which are frequently to be repeated, and the glorious Koran
15|88|Cast not thine eyes on the good things which We have bestowed on several of the unbelievers, so as to covet the same; neither be thou grieved on their account. Behave thyself with meekness towards the true believers
15|89|and say, I am a public preacher
15|90|If they believe not, We will inflict a like punishment on them, as We have inflicted on the dividers
15|91|who distinguished the Koran into different parts
15|92|for by thy Lord, We will demand an account from them all
15|93|of that which they have wrought
15|94|Wherefore publish that which thou hast been commanded, and withdraw from the idolaters
15|95|We will surely take thy part against the scoffers
15|96|who associate with God another god; they shall surely know their folly
15|97|And now We well know that thou art deeply concerned on account of that which they say
15|98|but do thou celebrate the praise of thy Lord; and be one of those who worship
15|99|and serve thy Lord, until death shall overtake thee
16|1|The sentence of God will surely come to be executed; wherefore do not hasten it. Praise be unto Him! And far be that from Him which they associate with Him
16|2|He shall cause the angels to descend with a revelation by his command, unto such of his servants as He pleaseth, saying, preach that there is no God, except myself; therefore fear Me
16|3|He hath created the heavens and the earth to manifest his justice: Far be that from Him which they associate with him
16|4|He hath created man of seed; and yet behold, he is a professed disputer against the resurrection
16|5|He hath likewise created the cattle for you: From them ye have wherewith to keep your selves warm, and other advantages; and of them do ye also eat
16|6|And they are likewise a credit unto you, when ye drive them home in the evening, and when ye lead them forth to feed in the morning
16|7|And they carry your burdens to a distant country, at which ye could not otherwise arrive, unless with great difficulty to yourselves; for your Lord is compassionate and merciful
16|8|And He hath also created horses, and mules, and asses, that ye may ride thereon, and for an ornament unto you; and He likewise createth other things which ye know not
16|9|It appertaineth unto God, to instruct men in the right way; and there is who turneth aside from the same: But if He had pleased, He would certainly have directed you all
16|10|It is He who sendeth down from heaven rain water, whereof ye have to drink, and from which plants, whereon ye feed your cattle, receive their nourishment
16|11|And by means thereof He causeth corn, and olives, and palm-trees, and grapes, and all kinds of fruits to spring forth for you. Surely herein is a sign of the divine power and wisdom unto people who consider
16|12|And He hath subjected the night and the day to your service; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, which are compelled to serve by his command. Verily herein are signs unto people of understanding
16|13|And He hath also given you dominion over whatever He hath created for you in the earth, distinguished by its different colour. Surely herein is a sign unto people who reflect
16|14|It is He who hath subjected the sea unto you, that ye might eat fish thereout, and take from thence ornaments for you to wear: And thou seest the ships plowing the waves thereof, that ye may seek to enrich your selves of his abundance, by commerce; and that ye might give thanks
16|15|And He hath thrown upon the earth mountains firmly rooted, lest it should move with you, and also rivers, and paths, that ye might be directed
16|16|And He hath likewise ordained marks whereby men may know their way; and they are directed by the stars
16|17|Shall God therefore who createth, be as he who createth not? Do ye not therefore consider
16|18|If ye attempt to reckon up the favours of God, ye shall not be able to compute their number: God is surely gracious, and merciful
16|19|and God knoweth that which ye conceal and that which ye publish
16|20|But the idols which ye invoke, besides God, create nothing, but are themselves created
16|21|They are dead, and not living; neither do they understand when they shall be raised
16|22|Your God is one God. As to those who believe not in the life to come, their hearts deny the plainest evidence, and they proudly reject the truth
16|23|There is no doubt but God knoweth that which they conceal and that which they discover: Verily He loveth not the proud
16|24|And when it is said unto them, what hath your Lord sent down unto Mohammed? They answer, fables of ancient times
16|25|Thus are they given up to error, that they may bear their own burdens without diminution on the day of resurrection, and also a part of the burdens of those whom they cause to err, without knowledge. Will it not be an evil burden which they shall bear
16|26|Their predecessors devised plots heretofore; but God came unto their building, to overthrow it from the foundations: And the roof fell on them from above, and a punishment came upon them, from whence they did not expect
16|27|Also on the day of resurrection He will cover them with shame; and will say, where are my companions, concerning whom ye disputed? Those unto whom knowledge shall have been given, shall answer, this day shall shame and misery fall upon the unbelievers
16|28|They whom the angels shall cause to die, having dealt unjustly with their own souls, shall offer to make their peace in the article of death, saying, we have done no evil. But the angels shall reply, yea; verily God well knoweth that which ye have wrought
16|29|Wherefore enter the gates of hell, therein to remain for ever; and miserable shall be the abode of the proud
16|30|And it shall be said unto those who shall fear God, what hath your Lord sent down? They shall answer, good: Unto those who do right shall be given an excellent reward in this world; but the dwelling of the next life shall be better; and happy shall be the dwelling of the pious
16|31|Namely, gardens of eternal abode, into which they shall enter; rivers shall flow beneath the same; therein shall they enjoy whatever they wish. Thus will God recompense the pious
16|32|Unto the righteous whom the angels shall cause to die, they shall say, peace be upon you; enter ye into paradise, as a reward for that which ye have wrought
16|33|Do the unbelievers expect any other than that the angels come unto them, to part their souls from their bodies; or that the sentence of thy Lord come to be executed on them? So did they act who were before them; and God was not unjust towards them in that He destroyed them; but they dealt unjustly with their own souls
16|34|The evils of that which they committed, reached them; and the divine judgment which they scoffed at, fell upon them
16|35|The idolaters say, if God had pleased, we had not worshipped any thing besides Him, neither had our fathers: Neither had we forbidden any thing, without Him. So did they who were before them. But is the duty of the apostles any other, than public preaching
16|36|We have heretofore raised up in every nation an apostle to admonish them, saying, worship God, and avoid Taghut. And of them there were some whom God directed, and there were others of them who were decreed to go astray. Wherefore go through the earth, O tribe of Koreish, and see what hath been the end of those who accused their apostles of imposture
16|37|If thou, O prophet, dost earnestly wish for their direction; verily God will not direct him whom He hath resolved to lead into error; neither shall they have any helpers
16|38|And they swear most solemnly by God, saying, God will not raise the dead. Yea; the promise thereof is true: But the greater part of men know it not
16|39|He will raise them that He may clearly shew them the truth concerning which they now disagree, and that the unbelievers may know that they are liars
16|40|Verily our speech unto any thing, when We will the same, is, that we only say unto it, be; and it is
16|41|As for those who have fled their country for the sake of God, after they had been unjustly persecuted; We will surely provide them an excellent habitation in this world, but the reward of the next life shall be greater; if they knew it
16|42|They who persevere patiently, and put their trust in their Lord, shall not fail of happiness in this life and in that which is to come
16|43|We have not sent any before thee, as our apostles, other than men, unto whom We spake by revelation. Inquire therefore of those who have the custody of the scriptures, if ye know not this to be truth
16|44|We sent them with evident miracles, and written revelations; and We have sent down unto thee this Koran, that thou mayest declare unto mankind that which hath been sent down unto them, and that they may consider
16|45|Are they who have plotted evil against their prophet secure, that God will not cause the earth to cleave under them, or that a punishment will not come upon them, from whence they do not expect
16|46|or that He will not chastise them while they are busied in travelling from one place to another, and in traffic? (for they shall not be able to elude the power of God)
16|47|or that He will not chastise them by a gradual destruction? But your Lord is truly gracious and merciful in granting you respite
16|48|Do they not consider the things which God hath created; whose shadows are cast on the right hand and on the left, worshipping God, and become contracted
16|49|Whatever moveth both in heaven and on earth, worshippeth God, and the angels also; and they are not elated with pride, so as to disdain his service
16|50|They fear their Lord, Who is exalted above them, and perform that which they are commanded
16|51|God said, take not unto yourselves two gods; for there is but one God: And revere Me
16|52|Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; and unto Him is obedience eternally due. Will ye therefore fear any besides God
16|53|Whatever favours ye have received, are certainly from God; and when evil afflicteth you, unto Him do ye make your supplication
16|54|yet when He taketh the evil from off you, behold, a part of you give a companion unto their Lord
16|55|to shew their ingratitude for the favours We have bestowed on them. Delight your selves in the enjoyments of this life: But hereafter shall ye know that ye cannot escape the divine vengeance
16|56|And they set apart unto idols which have no knowledge a part of the food which We have provided for them. By God, ye shall surely be called to account for that which ye have falsely devised
16|57|They attribute daughters unto God; -- far be it from him! -- but unto themselves children of the sex which they desire
16|58|And when any of them is told the news of the birth of a female, his face becometh black, and he is deeply afflicted
16|59|He hideth himself from the people, because of the ill tidings which have been told him; considering within himself whether he shall keep it with disgrace, or whether he shall bury it in the dust. Do they not make an ill judgment
16|60|Unto those who believe not in the next life, the similitude of evil ought to be applied, and unto God the most sublime similitude: For He is mighty and wise
16|61|If God should punish men for their iniquity, He would not leave on the earth any moving thing: But He giveth them respite unto an appointed time; and when their time shall come, they shall not be respited an hour, neither shall their punishment be anticipated
16|62|They attribute unto God that which they dislike themselves, and their tongues utter a lie; namely, that the reward of paradise is for them. There is no doubt but that the fire of hell is prepared for them, and that they shall be sent thither before the rest of the wicked
16|63|By God, We have heretofore sent messengers unto the nations before thee: But Satan prepared their works for them; he was their patron in this world, and in that which is to come they shall suffer a grievous torment
16|64|We have not sent down the book of the Koran unto thee, for any other purpose, than that thou shouldest declare unto them that truth concerning which they disagree; and for a direction and mercy unto people who believe
16|65|God sendeth down water from heaven, and causeth the earth to revive after it hath been dead. Verily herein is a sign of the resurrection unto people who hearken
16|66|Ye have also in cattle an example of instruction: We give you to drink of that which is in their bellies, a liquor between digested dregs, and blood; namely pure milk, which is swallowed with pleasure by those who drink it
16|67|And of the fruits of palm-trees, and of grapes, ye obtain an inebriating liquor, and also good nourishment. Verily herein is a sign unto people who understand
16|68|Thy Lord spake by inspiration unto the bee, saying, provide thee houses in the mountains, and in the trees, and of those materials wherewith men build hives for thee
16|69|Then eat of every kind of fruit, and walk in the beaten paths of thy Lord. There proceedeth from their bellies a liquor of various colour; wherein is a medicine for men. Verily herein is a sign unto people who consider
16|70|God hath created you, and He will hereafter cause you to die: And some of you shall have his life prolonged to a decrepit age, so that he shall forget whatever he knew; for God is wise and powerful
16|71|God causeth some of you to excel others in worldly possessions: Yet they who are caused to excel, do not give their wealth unto the slaves whom their right hands possess, that they may become equal sharers therein. Do they therefore deny the beneficence of God
16|72|God hath ordained you wives from among yourselves, and of your wives hath granted you children and grandchildren; and hath bestowed on you good things for food. Will they therefore believe in that which is vain, and ungratefully deny the goodness of God
16|73|They worship, besides God, idols which possess nothing wherewith to sustain them, either in heaven, or on earth; and have no power
16|74|Wherefore liken not any thing unto God: For God knoweth, but ye know not
16|75|God propoundeth as a parable a possessed slave, who hath power over nothing, and him on whom we have bestowed a good provision from us, and who giveth alms thereout both secretly and openly: Shall these two be esteemed equal? God forbid! But the greater part of them know it not
16|76|God also propoundeth as a parable two men; one of them born dumb, who is unable to do or understand any thing, but is a burden unto his master; whithersoever he shall send him, he shall not return with any good success: Shall this man, and he who hath his speech and understanding, and who commandeth that which is just, and followeth the right way, be esteemed equal
16|77|Unto God alone is the secret of heaven and earth known. And the business of the last hour shall be only as the twinkling of an eye, or even more quick: For God is almighty
16|78|God hath brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers; ye knew nothing, and He gave you the senses of hearing and seeing, and understandings, that ye might give thanks
16|79|Do they not behold the fowls which are enabled to fly in the open firmament of heaven? None supporteth them except God. Verily herein are signs unto people who believe
16|80|God hath also provided you houses for habitations for you; and hath also provided you tents of the skins of cattle, which ye find light to be removed on the day of your departure to new quarters, and easy to be pitched on the day of your sitting down therein: And of their wool, and their fur, and their hair hath He supplied you with furniture and household-stuff for a season
16|81|And God hath provided for you, of that which He hath created, conveniences to shade you from the sun, and He hath also provided you places of retreat in the mountains, and He hath given you garments to defend you from the heat, and coats of mail to defend you in your wars. Thus doth He accomplish his favour towards you, that ye may resign your selves unto Him
16|82|But if they turn back; verily thy duty is public preaching only
16|83|They acknowledge the goodness of God, and afterwards they deny the same; but the greater part of them are unbelievers
16|84|On a certain day We will raise a witness out of every nation: Then they who shall have been unbelievers shall not be suffered to excuse themselves, neither shall they be received into favour
16|85|And when they who shall have acted unjustly shall see the torment prepared for them; -- it shall not be mitigated unto them, neither shall they be respited
16|86|and when those who shall have been guilty of idolatry shall see their false gods, they shall say, O Lord, these are our idols which we invoked, besides Thee. But they shall return an answer unto them, saying, verily ye are liars
16|87|And on that day shall the wicked offer submission unto God; and the false deities which they imagined shall abandon them
16|88|As for those who shall have been infidels, and shall have turned aside others from the way of God, We will add unto them punishment upon punishment, because they have corrupted others
16|89|On a certain day We will raise up in every nation a witness against them, from among themselves; and We will bring thee, O Mohammed, as a witness against these Arabians. We have sent down unto thee the book of the Koran, for an explication of every thing necessary both as to faith and practice, and a direction, and mercy, and good tidings unto the Moslems
16|90|Verily God commandeth justice, and the doing of good, and the giving unto kindred what shall be necessary; and He forbiddeth wickedness, and iniquity, and oppression: He admonisheth you that ye may remember
16|91|Perform your covenant with God, when ye enter into covenant with Him; and violate not your oaths, after the ratification thereof; since ye have made God a witness over you. Verily God knoweth that which ye do
16|92|And be not like unto her who undoeth that which she hath spun, untwisting it after she hath twisted it strongly; taking your oaths between you deceitfully, because one party is more numerous than another party. Verily God only tempteth you therein; and He will make that manifest unto you, on the day of resurrection, concerning which ye now disagree
16|93|If God had pleased, He would surely have made you one people: But He will lead into error whom He pleaseth, and He will direct whom He pleaseth; and ye shall surely give an account of that which ye have done
16|94|Therefore take not your oaths between you deceitfully, lest your foot slip, after it hath been stedfastly fixed, and ye taste evil in this life, for that ye have turned aside from the way of God; and ye suffer a grievous punishment in the life to come
16|95|And sell not the covenant of God for a small price; for with God is a better recompense prepared for you, if ye be men of understanding
16|96|That which is with you will fail; but that which is with God is permanent: And We will surely reward those who shall persevere, according to the utmost merit of their actions
16|97|Whoso worketh righteousness, whether he be male or female, and is a true believer, We will surely raise him to a happy life; and We will give them their reward, according to the utmost merit of their actions
16|98|When thou readest the Koran, have recourse unto God, that He may preserve thee from Satan driven away with stones
16|99|He hath no power over those who believe, and who put their confidence in their Lord
16|100|but his power is over those only, who take him for their patron, and who give companions unto God
16|101|When We substitute in the Koran an abrogating verse in lieu of a verse abrogated, -- and God best knoweth the fitness of that which He revealeth, -- the infidels say, thou art only a forger of these verses: But the greater part of them know not truth from falsehood
16|102|Say, the holy spirit hath brought the same down from thy Lord with truth; that He may confirm those who believe, and for a direction and good tidings unto the Moslems
16|103|We also know that they say, verily, a certain man teacheth him to compose the Koran. The tongue of the person unto whom they incline, is a foreign tongue; but this, wherein the Koran is written, is the perspicuous Arabic tongue
16|104|Moreover as of those who believe not in the signs of God, God will not direct them, and they shall suffer a painful torment
16|105|Verily they imagine a falsehood who believe not in the signs of God, and they are really the liars
16|106|Whoever denieth God, after he hath believed, except him who shall be compelled against his will, and whose heart continueth stedfast in the faith, shall be severely chastised: But whoever shall voluntarily profess infidelity, on those shall the indignation of God fall, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment
16|107|This shall be their sentence, because they have loved the present life above that which is to come, and for that God directeth not the unbelieving people
16|108|These are they whose hearts, and hearing, and sight God hath sealed up; and these are the negligent
16|109|There is no doubt but that in the next life they shall perish
16|110|Moreover thy Lord will be favourable unto those who have fled their country, after having suffered persecution, and been compelled to deny the faith by violence, and who have since fought in defence of the true religion, and have persevered with patience; verily unto these will thy Lord be gracious and merciful, after they shall have shewn their sincerity
16|111|On a certain day shall every soul come to plead for it self, and every soul shall be repaid that which it shall have wrought; and they shall not be treated unjustly
16|112|God propoundeth as a parable a city which was secure and quiet, unto which her provisions came in abundance from every side; but she ungratefully denied the favours of God: Wherefore God caused her to taste the extreme famine, and fear, because of that which they had done
16|113|And now is an apostle come unto the inhabitants of Mecca from among themselves; and they accuse him of imposture: Wherefore a punishment shall be inflicted on them, while they are acting unjustly
16|114|Eat of what God hath given you for food, that which is lawful and good; and be thankful for the favours of God, if ye serve Him
16|115|He hath only forbidden you that which dieth of it self, and blood, and swine's flesh, and that which hath been slain in the name of any, besides God. But unto him who shall be compelled by necessity to eat of these things, not lusting nor wilfully transgressing, God will surely be gracious and merciful
16|116|And say not that wherein your tongues utter a lie; this is lawful, and this is unlawful; that ye may devise a lie concerning God: For they who devise a lie concerning God, shall not prosper
16|117|They shall have small enjoyment in this world, and in that which is to come they shall suffer a grievous torment
16|118|Unto the Jews did We forbid that which we have told thee formerly: And We did them no injury in that respect; but they injured their own souls
16|119|Moreover thy Lord will be favourable unto those who do evil through ignorance; and afterwards repent and amend: Verily unto these will thy Lord be gracious and merciful, after their repentance
16|120|Abraham was a model of true religion, obedient unto God, orthodox, and was not an idolater
16|121|He was also grateful for his benefits: Wherefore God chose him, and directed him into the right way
16|122|And We bestowed on him good in this world; and in the next he shall surely be one of the righteous
16|123|We have also spoken unto thee, O Mohammed, by revelation, saying, follow the religion of Abraham, who was othodox, and was no idolater
16|124|The sabbath was only appointed unto those who differed with their prophet concerning it; and thy Lord will surely judge between them, on the day of resurrection, as to that concerning which they differed
16|125|Invite men unto the way of thy Lord, by wisdom, and mild exhortation; and dispute with them in the most condescending manner: For thy Lord well knoweth him who strayeth from his path, and He well knoweth those who are rightly directed
16|126|If ye take vengeance on any, take a vengeance proportionable to the wrong which hath been done you; but if ye suffer wrong patiently, verily this will be better for the patient
16|127|Wherefore do thou bear opposition with patience; but thy patience shall not be practicable, unless with God's assistance. And be not thou grieved on account of the unbelievers; neither be thou troubled for that which they subtly devise
16|128|for God is with those who fear Him, and are upright
17|1|Praise be unto Him, who transported his servant by night, from the sacred temple of Mecca to the farther temple of Jerusalem, the circuit of which We have blessed, that We might shew him some of our signs; for God is He who heareth, and seeth
17|2|And We gave unto Moses the book of the law, and appointed the same to be a direction unto the children of Israel, commanding them, saying, beware that ye take not any other patron besides Me
17|3|O posterity of those whom We carried in the ark with Noah: Verily he was a grateful servant
17|4|And We expressly declared unto the children of Israel in the book of the law, saying, ye will surely commit evil in the earth twice, and ye will be elated with great insolence
17|5|And when the punishment threatened for the first of those transgressions came to be executed, We sent against you our servants, indued with exceeding strength in war, and they searched the inner apartments of your houses; and the prediction became accomplished
17|6|Afterwards We gave you the victory over them, in your turn, and We granted you increase of wealth and children, and We made you a more numerous people, saying
17|7|if ye do well, ye will do well to your own souls; and if ye do evil, ye will do it unto the same. And when the punishment threatened for your latter transgression came to be executed, We sent enemies against you to afflict you, and to enter the temple, as they entered it the first time, and utterly to destroy that which they had conquered
17|8|Peradventure your Lord will have mercy on you hereafter: But if ye return to transgress a third time, We also will return to chastise you; and We have appointed hell to be the prison of the unbelievers
17|9|Verily this Koran directeth unto the way which is most right, and declareth unto the faithful, who do good works, that they shall receive a great reward
17|10|and that for those who believe not in the life to come, We have prepared a grievous punishment
17|11|Man prayeth for evil, as he prayeth for good; for man is hasty
17|12|We have ordained the night and the day for two signs of our power: Afterwards We blot out the sign of the night, and We cause the sign of the day to shine forth, that ye may endeavour to obtain plenty from your Lord by doing your business therein, and that ye may know the number of years, and the computation of time; and every thing necessary have We explained by a perspicuous explication
17|13|The fate of every man have we bound about his neck; and we will produce unto him, on the day of resurrection, a book wherein his actions shall be recorded
17|14|It shall be offered him open, and the angels shall say unto him, read thy book; thine own soul will be a sufficient accountant against thee, this day
17|15|He who shall be rightly directed, shall be directed to the advantage only of his own soul; and he who shall err, shall err only against the same: Neither shall any laden soul be charged with the burden of another. We did not punish any people, until we had first sent an apostle to warn them
17|16|And when We resolved to destroy a city, We commanded the inhabitants thereof, who lived in affluence, to obey our apostle; but they acted corruptly herein: Wherefore the sentence was justly pronounced against that city; and We destroyed it with an utter destruction
17|17|And how many generations have We consumed since Noah? For thy Lord suffinciently knoweth and seeth the sins of his servants
17|18|Whosoever chooseth this transitory life, We will bestow on him therein before hand that which We please; on him, namely, whom We please: Afterwards will We appoint him hell for his abode; he shall be thrown into the same to be scorched, covered with ignominy, and utterly rejected from mercy
17|19|But whosoever chooseth the life to come, and directeth his endeavour towards the same, being also a true believer; the endeavour of these shall be acceptable unto God
17|20|On all will We bestow the blessings of this life, both on these and on those, of the gift of thy Lord; for the gift of thy Lord shall not be denied unto any
17|21|Behold, how We have caused some of them to surpass others in wealth and dignity: But the next life shall be more considerable in degrees of honour, and greater in excellence
17|22|Set not up another god with the true God, lest thou sit down in disgrace, and destitute
17|23|Thy Lord hath commanded that ye worship none, besides Him; and that ye shew kindness unto your parents, whether the one of them, or both of them attain to old age with thee. Wherefore say not unto them, fie on you! Neither reproach them, but speak respectfully unto them
17|24|and submit to behave humbly towards them, out of tender affection, and say, O Lord, have mercy on them both, as they nursed me when I was little
17|25|Your Lord well knoweth that which is in your souls; whether ye be men of integrity: And He will be gracious unto those who sincerely return unto Him
17|26|And give unto him who is of kin to you his due, and also unto the poor, and the traveller. And waste not thy substance profusely
17|27|For the profuse are brethren of the devils: And the devil was ungrateful unto his Lord
17|28|But if thou turn from them, in expectation of the mercy which thou hopest from thy Lord; at least, speak kindly unto them
17|29|And let not thy hand be tied up to thy neck; neither open it with an unbounded expansion, lest thou become worthy of reprehension, and be reduced to poverty
17|30|Verily thy Lord will enlarge the store of whom He pleaseth, and will be sparing unto whom He pleaseth; for He knoweth and regardeth his servants
17|31|Kill not your children for fear of being brought to want; We will provide for them and for you: Verily the killing them is a great sin
17|32|Draw not near unto fornication; for it is wickedness, and an evil way
17|33|Neither slay the soul which God hath forbidden you to slay, unless for a just cause; and whosoever shall be slain unjustly, We have given his heir power to demand satisfaction; but let him not exceed the bounds of moderation in putting to death the murderer in too cruel a manner, or by revenging his friend's blood on any other than the person who killed him; since he is assisted by this law
17|34|And meddle not with the substance of the orphan, unless it be to improve it, until he attain his age of strength: And perform your covenant; for the performance of your covenant shall be inquired into hereafter
17|35|And give full measure, when you measure ought; and weigh with a just balance. This will be better, and more easy for determining every man's due
17|36|And follow not that whereof thou hast no knowledge; for the hearing, and the sight, and the heart, every of these shall be examined at the last day
17|37|Walk not proudly in the land, for thou canst not cleave the earth, neither shalt thou equal the mountains in stature
17|38|All this is evil, and abominable in the sight of thy Lord
17|39|These precepts are a part of the wisdom which thy Lord hath revealed unto thee. Set not up any other god as equal unto God, lest thou be cast into hell, reproved and rejected
17|40|Hath your Lord preferably granted unto you sons, and taken for himself daughters from among the angels? Verily in asserting this ye utter a grievous saying
17|41|And now have we used various arguments and repetitions in this Koran, that they may be warned; yet it only rendereth them more disposed to fly from the truth
17|42|Say unto the idolaters, if there were other gods with him, as ye say, they would surely seek an occasion of making some attempt against the possessor of the throne
17|43|God forbid! And far, very far, be that from Him which they utter
17|44|The seven heavens praise Him, and the earth, and all who are therein: Neither is there any thing which doth not celebrate his praise; but ye understand not their celebration thereof: He is gracious and merciful
17|45|When thou readest the Koran, We place between thee and those who believe not in the life to come, a dark vail
17|46|and we put coverings over their hearts, lest they should understand it, and in their ears thickness of hearing. And when thou makest mention, in repeating the Koran, of thy Lord only, they turn their backs, flying the doctrine of his unity
17|47|We well know with what design they hearken, when they hearken unto thee, and when they privately discourse together: When the ungodly say, ye follow no other than a mad-man
17|48|Behold! What epithets they bestow on thee. But they are deceived; neither can they find any just occasion to reproach thee
17|49|They also say, after we shall have become bones and dust, shall we surely be raised a new creature
17|50|Answer, be ye stones, or iron
17|51|or some creature more improbable in your opinions to be raised to life. But they will say, who shall restore us to life? Answer, He who created you the first time: And they will wag their heads at thee, saying, when shall this be? Answer, peradventure it is nigh
17|52|On that day shall God call you forth from your sepulchres, and ye shall obey, with celebration of his praise; and ye shall think that ye tarried but a little while
17|53|Speak unto my servants, that they speak mildly unto the unbelievers, lest ye exasperate them, for Satan soweth discord among them, and Satan is a declared enemy unto man
17|54|Your Lord well knoweth you; if He pleaseth, He will have mercy on you, or, if He pleaseth, He will punish you: And We have not sent thee to be a steward over them
17|55|Thy Lord well knoweth all persons in heaven and on earth. We have bestowed peculiar favours on some of the prophets, preferably to others; and We gave unto David the psalms
17|56|Say, call upon those whom ye imagine to be gods besides Him; yet they will not be able to free you from harm, or to turn it on others
17|57|Those whom ye invoke, do themselves desire to be admitted to a near conjunction with their Lord; striving which of them shall approach nearest unto Him: They also hope for his mercy, and dread his punishment; for the punishment of thy Lord is terrible
17|58|There is no city but We will destroy the same before the day of resurrection, or We will punish it with a grievous punishment. This is written in the book of our eternal decrees
17|59|Nothing hindered us from sending thee with miracles, except that the former nations have charged them with imposture. We gave unto the tribe of Thamud, at their demand, the she-camel visible to their sight; yet they dealt unjustly with her: And We send not a prophet with miracles, but to strike terror
17|60|Remember when We said unto thee, verily thy Lord encompasseth men by his knowledge and power. We have appointed the vision which We shewed thee, and also the tree cursed in the Koran, only for an occasion of dispute unto men, and to strike them with terror; but it shall cause them to transgress only the more enormously
17|61|And remember when We said unto the angels, worship Adam; and they all worshipped him except Eblis, who said, shall I worship him whom Thou hast created of clay
17|62|And he said, what thinkest thou, as to this man whom thou hast honoured above me? Verily, if thou grant me respite until the day of resurrection, I will extirpate his off-spring, except a few
17|63|God answered, be gone, I grant thee respite: But whosoever of them shall follow thee, hell shall surely be your reward
17|64|an ample reward for your demerits! And entice to vanity such of them as thou canst, by thy voice; and assault them on all sides with thy horsemen and thy footmen; and partake with them in their riches, and their children; and make them promises; (but the devil shall make them no other than deceitful promises)
17|65|As to my servants, thou shalt have no power over them; for thy Lord is a sufficient protector of those who trust in Him
17|66|It is your Lord who driveth forward the ships for you in the sea, that ye may seek to enrich your selves of his abundance by commerce; for He is merciful towards you
17|67|When a misfortune befalleth you at sea, the false deities whom ye invoke are forgotten by you, except Him alone: Yet when He bringeth you safe to dry land, ye retire afar off from Him, and return to your idols; for man is ungrateful
17|68|Are ye therefore secure that He will not cause the dry land to swallow you up, or that He will not send against you a whirlwind driving the sands to overwhelm you? Then shall ye find none to protect you
17|69|Or are ye secure that He will not cause you again to commit your selves to the sea another time, and send against you a tempestuous wind, and drown you; for that ye have been ungrateful? Then shall ye find none to defend you against Us, in that distress
17|70|And now have We honoured the children of Adam by sundry peculiar privileges and endowments; and We have given them conveniencies of carriage by land and by sea, and have provided food for them of good things; and We have preferred them before many of our creatures which We have created, by granting them great prerogatives
17|71|On a certain day We will call all men to judgment with their respective leader: And whosoever shall have his book given him into his right hand, they shall read their book with joy and satisfaction; and they shall not be wronged a hair
17|72|And whoever hath been blind in this life, shall be also blind in the next, and shall wander more widely from the path of salvation
17|73|It wanted little but the unbelievers had tempted thee to swerve from the instructions which We had revealed unto thee, that thou shouldest devise concerning Us a different thing; and then would they have taken thee for their friend
17|74|And unless We had confirmed thee, thou hadst certainly been very near inclining unto them a little
17|75|Then would We surely have caused thee to taste the punishment of life, and the punishment of death; and thou shouldest not have found any to protect thee against Us
17|76|The unbelievers had likewise almost caused thee to depart the land, that they might have expelled thee thence: But then should they not have tarried therein after thee, except a little while
17|77|This is the method of dealing which We have prescribed our selves in respect to our apostles, whom We have already sent before thee: And thou shalt not find any change in our prescribed method
17|78|Regularly perform thy prayer at the declension of the sun, at the first darkness of the night, and the prayer of day-break; for the prayer of day-break is born witness unto by the angels
17|79|And watch some part of the night in the same exercise, as a work of supererogation for thee; peradventure thy Lord will raise thee to an honourable station
17|80|And say, O Lord, cause me to enter with a favourable entry and cause me to come forth with a fabourable coming forth; and grant me from Thee an assisting power
17|81|And say, truth is come, and falsehood is vanished: For falsehood is of short continuance
17|82|We send down of the Koran that which is a medicine and mercy unto the true believers, but it shall only increase the perdition of the unjust
17|83|When We bestow favours on man, he retireth and withdraweth himself ungratefully from Us: But when evil toucheth him, he despaireth of our mercy
17|84|Say, every one acteth after his own manner: But your Lord best knoweth who is most truly directed in his way
17|85|They will ask thee concerning the spirit: Answer, the spirit was created at the command of my Lord: But ye have no knowledge given unto you, except a little
17|86|If We pleased, We should certainly take away that which We have revealed unto thee; in such case thou couldest not find any to assist thee therein against Us
17|87|unless through mercy from thy Lord; for his favour towards thee hath been great
17|88|Say, verily if men and genii were purposely assembled, that they might produce a book like this Koran, they could not produce one like unto it, although the one of them assisted the other
17|89|And We have variously propounded unto men in this Koran, every kind of figurative argument; but the greater part of men refuse to receive it, merely out of infidelity
17|90|And they say, we will by no means believe on thee, until thou cause a spring of water to gush forth for us out of the earth
17|91|or thou have a garden of palm-trees and vines, and thou cause rivers to spring forth from the midst thereof in abundance
17|92|or thou cause the heaven to fall down upon us, as thou hast given out, in pieces; or thou bring down God and the angels to vouch for thee
17|93|or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend by a ladder to heaven: Neither will we believe thy ascending thither alone, until thou cause a book to descend unto us, bearing witness of thee, which we may read. Answer, my Lord be praised! Am I other than a man, sent as an apostle
17|94|And nothing hindreth men from believing, when a direction is come unto them, except that they say, hath God sent a man for his apostle
17|95|Answer, if the angels had walked on earth as familiar inhabitants thereof, We had surely sent down unto them from heaven an angel for our apostle
17|96|Say, God is a sufficient witness between me and you: For He knoweth and regardeth his servants
17|97|Whom God shall direct, he shall be the rightly directed; and whom He shall cause to err, thou shalt find none to assist, besides him. And We will gather them together on the day of resurrection, creeping on their faces, blind, and dumb, and deaf: Their abode shall be hell; so often as the fire thereof shall be extinguished, We will rekindle a burning flame to torment them
17|98|This shall be their reward, because they disbelieve in our signs, and say, when we shall have been reduced to bones and dust, shall we surely be raised new creatures
17|99|Do they not perceive that God, who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create other bodies, like their present? And He hath appointed them a limited term; there is no doubt thereof: But the ungodly reject the truth, merely out of unbelief
17|100|Say, if ye possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, ye would surely refrain from using them, for fear of spending them; for man is covetous
17|101|We heretofore gave unto Moses the power of working nine evident signs. And do thou ask the children of Israel as to the story of Moses; when he came unto them, and Pharaoh said unto him, verily I esteem thee, O Moses, to be deluded by sorcery
17|102|Moses answered, thou well knowest that none hath sent down these evident signs except the Lord of heaven and earth; and I surely esteem thee, O Pharaoh, a lost man
17|103|Wherefore Pharaoh sought to drive them out of the land; but We drowned him, and all those who were with him
17|104|And We said unto the children of Israel, after his destruction, dwell ye in the land: And when the promise of the next life shall come to be fulfilled, We will bring you both promiscuously to judgment
17|105|We have sent down the Koran with truth, and it hath descended with truth: And we have not sent thee otherwise than to be a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats
17|106|And We have divided the Koran, revealing it by parcels, that thou mightest read it unto men with deliberation; and We have sent it down, causing it to descend as occasion required
17|107|Say, whether ye believe therein, or do not believe, verily those who have been favoured with the knowledge of the scriptures which were revealed before it, when the same is rehearsed unto them, fall down on their faces, worshipping
17|108|and say, our Lord be praised, for that the promise of our Lord is surely fulfilled
17|109|And they fall down on their faces, weeping; and the hearing thereof increaseth their humility
17|110|Say, call upon God, or call on the Merciful: By which soever of the two names ye invoke Him, it is equal; for He hath most excellent names. Pronounce not thy prayer aloud, neither pronounce it with too low a voice, but follow a middle way between these
17|111|And say, praise be unto God, Who hath not begotten any child; Who hath no partner in the kingdom, nor hath any to protect him from contempt: And magnify Him by proclaiming his greatness
18|1|Praise be unto God, who hath sent down unto his servant the book of the Koran, and hath not inserted any crookedness, but hath made it a strait rule
18|2|That He should threaten a grievous punishment unto the unbelievers, from his presence; and should bear good tidings unto the faithful, who work righteousness, that they shall receive an excellent reward, namely, paradise
18|3|wherein they shall remain for ever
18|4|And that He should warn those who say, God hath begotten issue
18|5|of which matter they have no knowledge, neither had their fathers. A grievous saying it is, which proceedeth from their mouths: They speak no other than a lie
18|6|Peradventure thou wilt kill thy self with grief after them, out of thy earnest zeal for their conversion, if they believe not in this new revelation of the Koran
18|7|Verily we have ordained whatsoever is on the earth for the ornament thereof, that we might make trial of men, and see which of them excelleth in works
18|8|And we will surely reduce whatever is thereon, to dry dust
18|9|Dost thou consider that the companions of the cave, and Al Rakim, were one of our signs, and a great miracle
18|10|When the young men took refuge in the cave, they said, O Lord, grant us mercy from before thee, and dispose our business for us to a right issue
18|11|Wherefore We struck their ears with deafness, so that they slept without disturbance in the cave for a great number of years
18|12|Then We awaked them, that We might know which of the two parties was more exact in computing the space which they had remainded there
18|13|We will relate unto thee their history with truth. Verily they were young men who had believed in their Lord; and We had abundantly directed them
18|14|And We fortified their hearts with constancy when they stood before the tyrant; and they said, our Lord is the Lord of heaven and earth: We will by no means call on any god besides Him; for then should we surely utter an extravagance
18|15|These our fellow people have taken other gods, besides Him; although they bring no demonstrative argument for them: And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie concerning God
18|16|And they said the one to the other, when ye shall separate yourselves from them, and from the deities which they worship, except God, fly into the cave: Your Lord will pour his mercy on you abundantly, and will dispose your business for you to advantage
18|17|And thou mightest have seen the sun, when it had risen, to decline from their cave towards the right hand; and when it went down, to leave them on the left hand: And they were in the spacious part of the cave. This was one of the signs of God. Whomsoever God shall direct, he shall be rightly directed; and whomsoever He shall cause to err, thou shalt not find any to defend or to direct
18|18|And thou wouldst have judged them to have been awake, while they were sleeping; and We caused them to turn themselves to the right hand, and to the left. And their dog stretched forth his fore-legs in the mouth of the cave: If thou hadst come suddenly upon them, verily thou wouldest have turned thy back and fled from them, and thou wouldest have been filled with fear at the sight of them
18|19|And so We awaked them from their sleep, that they might ask questions of one another. One of them spake and said, how long have ye tarried here? They answered, we have tarried a day, or part of a day. The others said, your Lord, best knoweth the time ye have tarried: And now send one of you with this your money into the city, and let him see which of its inhabitants hath the best and cheapest food, and let him bring you provision from him; and let him behave circumspectly, and not discover you to any one
18|20|Verily, if they come up against you, they will stone you, or force you to return to their religion; and then shall ye not prosper for ever
18|21|And so We made their people acquainted with what had happened to them; that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that there is no doubt of the last hour; when they disputed among themselves concerning their matter. And they said, erect a building over them: Their Lord best knoweth their condition. Those who prevailed in their affair answered, we will surely build a chapel over them
18|22|Some say, the sleepers were three; and their dog was the fourth: And others say, they were five; and their dog was the sixth; guessing at a secret matter: And others say, they were seven; and their dog was the eighth. Say, my Lord best knoweth their number: None shall know them, except a few. Wherefore dispute not concerning them, unless with a clear disputation, according to what hath been revealed unto thee: And ask not any of the Christians concerning them
18|23|Say not of any matter, I will surely do this to morrow
18|24|unless thou add, if God please. And remember thy Lord, when thou forgettest, and say, my Lord is able to direct me with ease, that I may draw near unto the truth of this matter rightly
18|25|And they remained in their cave three hundred years, and nine years over
18|26|Say, God best knoweth how long they continued there: Unto Him are the secrets of heaven and earth known; do thou make him to see and to hear. The inhabitants thereof have no protector besides Him; neither doth He suffer any one to have a share in the establishment or knowledge of his decree
18|27|Read that which hath been revealed unto thee, of the book of thy Lord, without presuming to make any change therein: There is none who hath power to change his words; and thou shalt not find any to fly to, besides Him, if thou attempt it
18|28|Behave thy self with constancy towards those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, and who seek his favour; and let not thine eyes be turned away from them, seeking the pomp of this life; neither obey him whose heart We have caused to neglect the remembrance of us, and who followeth his lusts, and leaveth the truth behind him
18|29|And say, the truth is from your Lord; wherefore let him who will, believe, and let him who will, be incredulous. We have surely prepared for the unjust hell fire, the flame and smoke whereof shall surround them like a pavilion: And if they beg relief, they shall be relieved with water like molten brass, which shall scald their faces; O how miserable a portion, and how unhappy a couch
18|30|As to those who believe, and do good works, we will not suffer the reward of him who shall work righteousness to perish
18|31|For them are prepared gardens of eternal abode, which shall be watered by rivers; they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and shall be clothed in green garments of fine silk and brocades; reposing themselves therein on thrones. O how happy a reward, and how easy a couch
18|32|And propound unto them as a parable two men: On the one of whom We had bestowed two vineyards, and had surrounded them with palm-trees, and had caused corn to grow between them
18|33|Each of the gardens brought forth its fruit every season, and failed not at all; and we caused a river to flow in the midst thereof
18|34|And he had great abundance. And he said unto his companion by way of debate, I am superior to thee in wealth, and have a more powerful family
18|35|And he went into his garden, being guilty of injustice against his own soul, and said, I do not think that this garden will decay for ever
18|36|neither do I think that the last hour will come: And although I should return unto my Lord, verily I shall find a better garden than this in exchange
18|37|And his companion said unto him, by way of debate, dost thou not believe in Him who created thee of the dust, and afterwards of seed; and then fashioned thee into a perfect man
18|38|But as for me, God is my Lord; and I will not associate any other deity with my Lord
18|39|And when thou enterest thy garden, wilt thou not say, what God pleaseth shall come to pass; there is no power but in God alone? Although thou seest me to be inferior to thee in wealth and number of children
18|40|my Lord is well able to bestow on me a better gift than thy garden, and to shoot his arrows against the same from heaven, so that it shall become barren dust
18|41|or its water may sink deep into the earth, that thou canst not draw thereof
18|42|And his possessions were encompassed with destruction, as his companion had forewarned him: Wherefore he began to turn down the palms of his hands out of sorrow and regret for that which he had expended thereon; for the vines thereof were fallen down on their trails: And he said, would to God that I had not associated any other deity with my Lord
18|43|And he had no party to assist him, besides God, neither was he able to defend himself against his vengeance
18|44|In such case protection belongeth of right unto God alone; He is the best rewarder, and the best giver of success
18|45|And propound to them a similitude of the present life. It is like water which We send down from heaven; and the herb of the earth is mixed therewith, and after it hath been green and flourishing, in the morning it becometh dry stubble, which the winds scatter abroad: And God is able to do all things
18|46|Wealth and children are the ornaments of this present life: But good works, which are permanent, are better in the sight of thy Lord, with respect to the reward, and better with respect to hope
18|47|On a certain day We will cause the mountains to pass away, and thou shalt see the earth appearing plain and even; and We will gather mankind together, and We will not leave any one of them behind
18|48|And they shall be set before thy Lord in distinct order, and He shall say unto them, now are ye come unto us naked, as We created you the first time: But ye thought that We should not perform our promise unto you
18|49|And the book wherein every one's actions are recorded shall be put into his hand; and thou shalt see the wicked in great terror, because of that which is written therein, and they shall say, Alas for us! What meaneth this book? It omitteth neither a small action nor a great one, but it compriseth the same; and they shall find that which they have wrought, present before their eyes: And thy Lord will not deal unjustly with any one
18|50|Remember when We said unto the angels, worship ye Adam: And they all worshipped him, except Eblis, who was one of the genii, and departed from the command of his Lord. Will ye therefore take him and his offspring for your patrons besides Me, notwithstanding they are your enemies? Miserable shall such a change be to the ungodly
18|51|I called not them to be present at the creation of the heavens and of the earth, nor at the creation of themselves, neither did I take those seducers for my assistants
18|52|On a certain day, God shall say unto the idolaters, call those whom ye imagined to be my companions, to protect you: And they shall call them, but they shall not answer them; and We will place a valley of destruction between them
18|53|And the wicked shall see hell fire; and they shall know that they shall be thrown into the same, and they shall find no way to avoid it
18|54|And now have We variously propounded unto men, in this Koran, a parable of every kind; but man cavilleth at most things therein
18|55|Yet nothing hindreth men from believing, now a direction is come unto them, and from asking pardon of their Lord, excepting that they wait until the punishment of their predecessors come to be inflicted on them, or that the chastisement of the next life come upon them publicly
18|56|We send not our messengers, but to bear good tidings, and to denounce threats. Those who believe not, dispute with vain arguments, that they may thereby render the truth of no effect: And they hold my signs, and the admonitions which have been made them, in derision
18|57|And who is more unjust than he who hath been acquainted with the signs of his Lord, and retireth afar off from the same, and forgetteth that which his hands have formerly committed? Verily We have cast veils over their hearts, lest they should understand the Koran, and into their ears thickness of hearing: If thou invite them to the true direction, yet will they not therefore be directed for ever
18|58|Thy Lord is gracious, indued with mercy; if He would have punished them for that which they have committed, He would doubtless have hastened their punishment: But a threat hath been denounced against them, and they shall find no refuge, besides Him
18|59|And those former cities did We destroy, when they acted unjustly; and We gave them previous warning of their destruction
18|60|And remember when Moses said unto his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, I will not cease to go forward, until I come to the place where the two seas meet; or I will travel for a long space of time
18|61|But when they were arrived at the meeting of the two seas, they forgot their fish, which they had taken with them; and the fish took its way freely in the sea
18|62|And when they had passed beyond that place, Moses said unto his servant, bring us our dinner; for now are we fatigued with this our journey
18|63|His servant answered, dost thou know what has befallen me? When we took up our lodging at the rock, verily I forgot the fish: And none made me to forget it, except Satan, that I should not remind thee of it. And the fish took its way in the sea, in a wonderful manner
18|64|Moses said, this is what we sought after. And they both went back, returning by the way they came
18|65|And coming to the rock they found one of our servants, unto whom We had granted mercy from us, and whom We had taught wisdom from before us
18|66|And Moses said unto him, shall I follow thee, that thou mayest teach me part of that which thou hast been taught, for a direction unto me
18|67|He answered, verily thou canst not bear with me
18|68|For how canst thou patiently suffer those things, the knowledge whereof thou dost not comprehend
18|69|Moses replied, thou shalt find me patient, if God please; neither will I be disobedient unto thee in any thing
18|70|He said, if thou follow me therefore, ask me not concerning any thing, until I shall declare the meaning thereof unto thee
18|71|So they both went on by the sea shore, until they went up into a ship; and he made a hole therein. And Moses said unto him, hast thou made a hole therein, that thou mightest drown those who are on board? Now hast thou done a strange thing
18|72|He answered, did I not tell thee that thou couldest not bear with me
18|73|Moses said, rebuke me not, because I did forget; and impose not on me a difficulty in what I am commanded
18|74|Wherefore they left the ship and proceeded, until they met with a youth; and he slew him. Moses said, hast thou slain an innocent person, without his having killed another? Now hast thou committed an unjust action
18|75|He answered, did I not tell thee that thou couldest not bear with me
18|76|Moses said, if I ask thee concerning any thing hereafter, suffer me not to accompany thee: Now hast thou received an excuse from me
18|77|They went forwards therefore, until they came to the inhabitants of a certain city: And they asked food of the inhabitants thereof; but they refused to receive them. And they found therein a wall, which was ready to fall down; and he set it upright. Whereupon Moses said unto him, if thou wouldest, thou mightest doubtless have received a reward for it
18|78|He answered, this shall be a separation between me and thee: But I will first declare unto thee the signification of that which thou couldest not bear with patience
18|79|The vessel belonged to certain poor men, who did their business in the sea: And I was minded to render it unserviceable, because there was a king behind them, who took every sound ship by force
18|80|As to the youth, his parents were true believers; and we feared lest he, being an unbeliever, should oblige them to suffer his perverseness and ingratitude
18|81|Wherefore we desired that their Lord might give them a more righteous child in exchange for him, and one more affectionate towards them
18|82|And the wall belonged to two orphan youths in the city, and under it was a treasure hidden which belonged to them; and their father was a righteous man: And thy Lord was pleased that they should attain their full age, and take forth their treasure, through the mercy of thy Lord. And I did not what thou hast seen of mine own will, but by God's direction. This is the interpretation of that which thou couldest not bear with patience
18|83|The Jews will ask thee concerning Dhu'lkarnein. Answer, I will rehearse unto you an account of him
18|84|We made him powerful in the earth, and We gave him means to accomplish every thing he pleased
18|85|And he followed his way
18|86|until he came to the place where the sun setteth; and he found it to set in a spring of black mud; and he found near the same a certain people. And we said, O Dhu'lkarnein, either punish this people, or use gentleness towards them
18|87|He answered, whosoever of them shall commit injustice, we will surely punish him in this world; afterwards shall he return unto his Lord, and He shall punish him with a severe punishment
18|88|But whosoever believeth, and doth that which is right, shall receive the most excellent reward, and We will give him in command that which is easy
18|89|Then he continued his way
18|90|until he came to the place where the sun riseth; and he found it to rise on certain people, unto whom We had not given any thing wherewith to shelter themselves therefrom
18|91|Thus it was; and we comprehended with our knowledge the forces which were with him
18|92|And he prosecuted his journey from south to north
18|93|until he came between the two mountains; beneath which he found certain people, who could scarce understand what was said
18|94|And they said, O Dhu'lkarnein, verily Gog and Magog waste the land; shall we therefore pay thee tribute, on condition that thou build a rampart between us and them
18|95|He answered, the power wherewith my Lord hath strengthened me, is better than your tribute: But assist me strenuously, and I will set a strong wall between you and them
18|96|Bring me iron in large pieces, until it fill up the space between the two sides of these mountains. And he said to the workmen, blow with your bellows, until it make the iron red hot as fire. And he said further, bring me molten brass, that I may pour upon it
18|97|Wherefore, when this wall was finished, Gog and Magog could not scale it, neither could they dig through it
18|98|And Dhu'lkarnein said, this is a mercy from my Lord: But when the prediction of my Lord shall come to be fulfilled, he shall reduce the wall to dust; and the prediction of my Lord is true
18|99|On that day We will suffer some of them to press tumultuously like waves on others; and the trumpet shall be sounded, and We will gather them in a body together
18|100|And We will set hell, on that day, before the unbelievers
18|101|whose eyes have been veiled from my remembrance, and who could not hear my words
18|102|Do the unbelievers think that I will not punish them, for that they take my servants for their protectors besides me? Verily We have prepared hell for the abode of the infidels
18|103|Say, shall We declare unto you those whose works are vain
18|104|whose endeavour in the present life hath been wrongly directed, and who think they do the work which is right
18|105|These are they who believe not in the signs of their Lord, or that they shall be assembled before Him; wherefore their works are vain, and We will not allow them any weight on the day of resurrection
18|106|This shall be their reward, namely, hell; for that they have disbelieved, and have held my signs and my apostles in derision
18|107|But as for those who believe and do good works, they shall have the gardens of paradise for their abode
18|108|they shall remain therein for ever; they shall wish for no change therein
18|109|Say, if the sea were ink to write the words of my Lord, verily the sea would fail, before the words of my Lord would fail; although We added another sea like unto it as a farther supply
18|110|Say, verily I am only a man as ye are. It is revealed unto me that your God is one only God: Let him therefore who hopeth to meet his Lord, work a righteous work; and let him not make any other to partake in the worship of his Lord
19|1|S
19|2|A commemoration of the mercy of thy Lord towards his servant Zacharias when he called upon his Lord, invoking him in secret
19|3|When he called upon his LORD, invoking him in secret
19|4|and said, O Lord, verily my bones are weakened, and my head is become white with hoariness and I have never been unsuccessful in my prayers to thee, O Lord
19|5|But now I fear my nephews, who are to succeed after me, for my wife is barren: Wherefore give me a successor of my own body from before thee
19|6|who may be my heir, and may be an heir of the family of Jacob; and grant, O Lord, that he may be acceptable unto thee
19|7|And the angel answered him, O Zacharias, verily We bring thee tidings of a son, whose name shall be John; We have not caused any to bear the same name before him
19|8|Zacharias said, Lord, how shall I have a son, seeing my wife is barren, and I am now arrived at a great age, and am decrepit
19|9|The angel said so shall it be: Thy Lord saith, this is easy with Me; since I created thee heretofore, when thou wast nothing
19|10|Zacharias answered, O Lord, give me a sign. The angel replied, thy sign shall be, that thou shalt not speak to men for three nights, although thou be in perfect health
19|11|And he went forth unto his people, from the chamber, and he made signs unto them, as if he should say, praise ye God in the morning and in the evening
19|12|And We said unto his son, O John, receive the book of the law, with a resolution to study and observe it. And We bestowed on him wisdom, when he was yet a child
19|13|and mercy from us, and purity of life; and he was a devout person
19|14|and dutiful towards his partents, and was not proud or rebellious
19|15|Peace be on him the day whereon he was born, and the day whereon he shall die, and the day whereon he shall be raised to life
19|16|And remember in the book of the Koran the story of Mary; when she retired from her family to a place towards the east
19|17|and took a veil to conceal herself from them; and We sent our spirit Gabriel unto her, and he appeared unto her in the shape of a perfect man
19|18|She said, I fly for refuge unto the merciful God, that He may defend me from thee: If thou fearest Him, thou wilt not approach me
19|19|He answered, verily I am the messenger of thy Lord, and am sent to give thee a holy son
19|20|She said, how shall I have a son, seeing a man hath not touched me, and I am no harlot
19|21|Gabriel replied, so shall it be: Thy Lord saith, this is easy with Me; and We will perform it, that We may ordain him for a sign unto men, and a mercy from Us: For it is a thing which is decreed
19|22|Wherefore she conceived him: And she retired aside with him in her womb to a distant place
19|23|and the pains of childbirth came upon her near the trunk of a palm-tree. She said, would to God I had died before this, and had become a thing forgotten, and lost in oblivion
19|24|And He who was beneath her called to her, saying, be not grieved: Now hath God provided a rivulet under thee
19|25|and do thou shake the body of the palm-tree, and it shall let fall ripe dates upon thee, ready gathered
19|26|And eat, and drink, and calm thy mind. Moreover if thou see any man, and he question thee, say, verily I have vowed a fast unto the merciful; wherefore I will by no means speak to a man this day
19|27|So she brought the child to her people, carrying him in her arms. And they said unto her, O Mary, now hast thou done a strange thing
19|28|O sister of Aaron, thy father was not a bad man, neither was thy mother a harlot
19|29|But she made signs unto the child to answer them; and they said, how shall we speak to him, who is an infant in the cradle
19|30|Whereupon the child said, verily I am the servant of God; He hath given me the book of the gospel, and hath appointed me a prophet
19|31|And He hath made me blessed, wheresoever I shall be; and hath commanded me to observe prayer, and to give alms, so long as I shall live
19|32|and he hath made me dutiful towards my mother, and hath not made me proud, or unhappy
19|33|And peace be on me the day whereon I was born, and the day whereon I shall die, and the day whereon I shall be raised to life
19|34|This was Jesus the son of Mary; the word of truth, concerning whom they doubt
19|35|It is not meet for God, that He should have any son: God forbid! When He decreeth a thing, He only saith unto it, be; and it is
19|36|And verily God is my Lord, and your Lord; wherefore serve Him: This is the right way
19|37|Yet the sectaries differ among themselves concerning Jesus; but woe be unto those who are unbelievers, because of their appearance at the great day
19|38|Do Thou cause them to hear, and do Thou cause them to see, on the day whereon they shall come unto Us to be judged: But the ungodly are this day in a manifest error
19|39|And do thou forewarn them of the day of sighing, when the matter shall be determined, while they are now sunk in negligence and do not believe
19|40|Verily We will inherit the earth, and whatever creatures are therein; and unto Us shall they all return
19|41|And remember Abraham in the book of the Koran; for he was one of great veracity, and a prophet
19|42|When he said unto his father, O my father, why dost thou worship that which heareth not, neither seeth, nor profiteth thee at all
19|43|O my father, verily a degree of knowledge hath been bestowed on me, which hath not been bestowed on thee: Wherefore follow me; I will lead thee into an even way
19|44|O my father, serve not Satan; for Satan was rebellious unto the Merciful
19|45|O my father, verily I fear lest a punishment be inflicted on thee from the Merciful, and thou become a companion of Satan
19|46|His father answered, dost thou reject my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will surely stone thee: Wherefore leave me for a long time
19|47|Abraham replied, peace be on thee: I will ask pardon for thee of my Lord; for He is gracious unto me
19|48|And I will separate my self from you, and from the idols which ye invoke besides God; and I will call upon my Lord: It may be that I shall not be unsuccessful in calling on my Lord, as ye are in calling upon them
19|49|And when he had separated himself from them, and from the idols which they worshipped besides God, We gave him Isaac and Jacob; and We made each of them a prophet
19|50|and We bestowed on them, through our mercy, the gift of prophecy, and children, and wealth; and We caused them to deserve the highest commendations
19|51|And remember Moses in the book of the Koran: For he was sincerely upright, and was an apostle and a prophet
19|52|And We called unto him from the right side of mount Sinai, and caused him to draw near, and to discourse privately with Us
19|53|And We gave him, through our mercy, his brother Aaron, a prophet, for his assistant
19|54|Remember also Ismael in the same book: For he was true to his promise; and was an apostle, and a prophet
19|55|And he commanded his family to observe prayer, and to give alms; and he was acceptable unto his Lord
19|56|And remember Edris in the same book; for he was a just person, and a prophet
19|57|And we exalted him to a high place
19|58|These are they unto whom God hath been bounteous, of the prophets of the posterity of Adam, and of those whom We carried in the ark with Noah; and of the posterity of Abraham, and of Israel, and of those whom We have directed and chosen. When the signs of the Merciful were read unto them, they fell down, worshipping, and wept
19|59|But a succeeding generation have come after them, who neglect prayer, and follow their lusts; and they shall surely fall into evil
19|60|Except him who repenteth, and believeth, and doth that which is right; these shall enter paradise, and they shall not in the least be wronged
19|61|Gardens of perpetual abode shall be their reward, which the Merciful hath promised unto his servants, as an object of faith; for his promise will surely come to be fulfilled
19|62|Therein shall they hear no vain discourse, but peace; and their provision shall be prepared for them therein morning and evening
19|63|This is paradise, which We will give for an inheritance unto such of our servants as shall be pious
19|64|We descend not from heaven, unless by the command of thy Lord: Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is before us, and whatsoever is behind us, and whatsoever is in the intermediate space; neither is thy Lord forgetful of thee
19|65|He is the Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatsoever is between them: Wherefore worship Him, and be constant in his worship. Dost thou know any named like Him
19|66|Man saith, after I shall have been dead, shall I really be brought forth alive from the grave
19|67|Doth not man remember that We created him heretofore, when he was nothing
19|68|But by thy Lord We will surely assemble them and the devils to judgment; then will We set them round about hell on their knees
19|69|Afterwards We will draw forth from every sect such of them as shall have been a more obstinate rebel against the Merciful
19|70|and We best know which of them are more worthy to be burned therein
19|71|There shall be none of you but shall descend into the same hell: This is an established decree upon thy Lord
19|72|Afterwards We will deliver those who shall have been pious, but We will leave the ungodly therein on their knees
19|73|When our manifest signs are read unto them, the infidels say unto the true believers, which of the two parties is in the more eligible condition, and formeth the more excellent assembly
19|74|But how many generations have We destroyed before them, which excelled them in wealth, and in outward appearance
19|75|Say, whosoever is in error, the Merciful will grant him a long and prosperous life; until they see that with which they are threatened, whether it be the punishment of this life, or that of the last hour; and hereafter they shall know who is in the worse condition, and the weaker in forces
19|76|God shall more fully direct those who receive direction; and the good works which remain for ever, are better in the sight of thy Lord than worldly possessions, in respect to the reward, and more eligible in respect to the future recompence
19|77|Hast thou seen him who believeth not in our signs, and saith, I shall surely have riches and children bestowed on me
19|78|Is he acquainted with the secrets of futurity; or hath he received a covenant from the Merciful that it shall be so
19|79|By no means. We will surely write down that which he saith; and increasing We will increase his punishment
19|80|And We will be his heir as to that which he speaketh of, and on the last day he shall appear before Us alone and naked
19|81|They have taken other gods, besides God, that they may be a glory unto them
19|82|By no means. Hereafter shall they deny their worship; and they shall become adversaries unto them
19|83|Dost thou not see that we send the devils against the infidels, to incite them to sin by their instigations
19|84|Wherefore be not in hast to call down destruction upon them; for we number unto them a determined number of days of respite
19|85|On a certain day we will assemble the pious before the Merciful in an honourable manner, as ambassadors come into the presence of a prince
19|86|but we will drive the wicked into hell, as cattle are driven to water
19|87|They shall obtain no intercession, except he only who hath received a covenant from the Merciful
19|88|They say, the Merciful hath begotten issue
19|89|Now have ye uttered an impious thing
19|90|It wanteth little but that on occasion thereof the heavens be rent, and the earth cleave in sunder, and the mountains be overthrown and fall
19|91|for that they attribute children unto the Merciful
19|92|whereas it becometh not God to beget children
19|93|Verily there is none in heaven or on earth, but shall approach the Merciful as his servant
19|94|He encompasseth them by his knowledge and power, and numbereth them with an exact computation
19|95|And they shall all come unto him on the day of resurrection, destitute both of helpers and followers
19|96|But as for those who believe and do good works, the Merciful will bestow on them love
19|97|Verily we have rendered the Koran easy for thy tongue, that thou mayest thereby declare our promises unto the pious, and mayest thereby denounce threats unto contentious people
19|98|And how many generations have we destroyed before them? Dost thou find one of them remaining? Or dost thou hear so much as a whisper concerning them
20|1|H
20|2|We have not sent down the Koran unto thee, that thou shouldest be unhappy
20|3|but for an admonition unto him who feareth God
20|4|Being sent down from Him who created the earth, and the lofty heavens
20|5|The Merciful sitteth on his throne
20|6|Unto him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever is under the earth
20|7|If thou pronounce thy prayers with a loud voice, know that it is not necessary in respect to God; for he knoweth that which is secret, and what is yet more hidden
20|8|God! There is no god but he: He hath most excellent names
20|9|Hast thou been informed of the history of Moses
20|10|When he saw fire, and said unto his family, tarry ye here; for I perceive fire: Peradventure I may bring you a brand thereout, or may find a direction in our way by the fire
20|11|And when he was come near unto it, a voice called unto him, saying, O Moses
20|12|Verily I am thy Lord: Wherefore put off thy shoes; for thou art in the sacred valley Towa
20|13|And I have chosen thee; therefore hearken with attention unto that which is revealed unto thee
20|14|Verily I am God; there is no god beside me: Wherefore worship me, and perform thy prayer in remembrance of me
20|15|Verily the hour cometh: I will surely manifest the same, that every soul may receive its reward for that which it hath deliberately done
20|16|Let not him who believeth not therein, and who followeth his lust, prevent thee from believing in the same, lest thou perish
20|17|Now what is that in thy right hand O Moses
20|18|He answered, it is my rod whereon I lean, and with which I beat down leaves for my flock; and I have other uses for it
20|19|God said unto him, cast it down, O Moses
20|20|And he cast it down, and behold, it became a serpent, which ran about
20|21|God said, take hold on it, and fear not: We will reduce it to its former condition
20|22|And put thy right hand under thy left arm: It shall come forth white, without any hurt. This shall be another sign
20|23|That we may shew thee some of our greatest signs
20|24|Go unto Pharaoh: For he is exceedingly impious
20|25|Moses answered, Lord, enlarge my breast
20|26|and make what thou hast commanded me easy unto me
20|27|And loose the knot of my tongue
20|28|that they may understand my speech
20|29|And give me a counsellor of my family
20|30|namely, Aaron my brother
20|31|Gird up my loins by him
20|32|and make him my collegue in the business
20|33|That we may praise thee greatly
20|34|and may remember thee often
20|35|for thou regardest us
20|36|God replied, now hast thou obtained thy request, O Moses
20|37|And we have heretofore been gracious unto thee
20|38|another time; when we revealed unto thy mother that which was revealed unto her, saying
20|39|put him into the ark, and cast him into the river, and the river shall throw him on the shore; and my enemy and his enemy shall take him and bring him up; and I bestow on thee love from me, that thou mightest be bred up under my eye
20|40|When thy sister went and said, shall I bring you unto one who will nurse the child? So we returned thee unto thy mother, that her mind might be set at ease, and that she might not be afflicted. And thou slewest a soul, and we delivered thee from trouble; and we proved thee by several trials: And afterwards thou didst dwell some years among the inhabitants of Madian. Then thou camest hither according to our decree, O Moses
20|41|and I have chosen thee for my self
20|42|Wherefore go thou and thy brother with my signs; and be not negligent in remembering me
20|43|Go ye unto Pharaoh, for he is excessively impious
20|44|And speak mildly unto him; peradventure he will consider, or will fear our threats
20|45|They answered, O Lord, verily we fear lest he be precipitately violent against us, or lest he transgress more exorbitantly
20|46|God replied, fear not; for I am with you: I will hear and will see
20|47|Go ye therefore unto him, and say, verily we are the messengers of thy Lord: Wherefore send the children of Israel with us, and do not afflict them. Now are we come unto thee with a sign from thy Lord: And peace be upon him who shall follow the true direction
20|48|Verily it hath been revealed unto us, that a punishment shall be inflicted on him who shall charge us with imposture, and shall turn back. And when they had delivered their message
20|49|Pharaoh said, who is your Lord, O Moses
20|50|He answered, our Lord is he who giveth all things: He hath created them, and directed them by his providence
20|51|Pharaoh said, what therefore is the condition of the former generations
20|52|Moses answered, the knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in the book of his decrees: My Lord erreth not, neither doth he forget
20|53|It is he who hath spread the earth as a bed for you, and hath made you paths therein; and who sendeth down rain from heaven, whereby we cause various kinds of vegetables to spring forth
20|54|saying, eat of part, and feed your cattle with other part thereof. Verily herein are signs unto those who are indued with understanding
20|55|Out of the ground have we created you; and to the same will we cause you to return, and we will bring you forth from thence another time
20|56|And we shewed Pharaoh all our signs which we had empowered Moses to perform: But he accused him of imposture, and refused to believe
20|57|and he said, art thou come unto us that thou mayest dispossess us of our land by thy enchantments, O Moses
20|58|Verily we will meet thee with the like enchantments: Wherefore fix an appointment between us and thee; we will not fail it, neither shalt thou, in an equal place
20|59|Moses answered, let your appointment be on the day of your solemn feast; and let the people be assembled in open day
20|60|And Pharaoh turned away from Moses, and gathered together the most expert magicians, to execute his stratagem; and then came to the appointment
20|61|Moses said unto them, woe be unto you! Do not devise a lie against God, lest he utterly destroy you by some judgment: For he shall not prosper who deviseth lies
20|62|And the magicians disputed concerning their affair among themselves, and discoursed in private
20|63|And they said, these two are certainly magicians: They seek to dispossess you of your land by their sorcery, and to lead away with them your chiefest and most considerable men
20|64|Wherefore collect all your cunning, and then come in order: For he shall prosper this day, who shall be superior
20|65|They said, O Moses, whether wilt thou cast down thy rod first, or shall we be the first who cast down our rods
20|66|He answered, do ye cast down your rods first. And behold, their cords and their rods appeared unto him, by their enchantment, to run about like serpents
20|67|Wherefore Moses conceived fear in his heart
20|68|But we said unto him, fear not; for thou shalt be superior
20|69|Therefore cast down the rod which is in thy right hand; and it shall swallow up the seeming serpents which they have made: For what they have made is only the deceipt of an enchanter; and an enchanter shall not prosper, whithersoever he cometh
20|70|And the magicians, when they saw the miracle which Moses performed, fell down and worshipped, saying, we believe in the Lord of Aaron and of Moses
20|71|Pharaoh said unto them, do ye believe in him before I give you permission? Verily this is your master, who hath taught you magic. But I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on the opposite sides; and I will crucify you on trunks of palm-trees: And ye shall know which of us is more severe in punishing, and can longer protract your pains
20|72|They answered, we will by no means have greater regard unto thee, than unto those evident miracles which have been shewn us, or than unto him who hath created us. Pronounce therefore that sentence against us which thou art about to pronounce: For thou canst only give sentence as to this present life
20|73|Verily we believe on our Lord, that he may forgive us our sins, and the sorcery which thou hast forced us to exercise: For God is better to reward, and more able to prolong punishment than thou
20|74|Verily whosoever shall appear before his Lord on the day of judgment, polluted with crimes, shall have hell for his reward; he shall not die therein, neither shall he live
20|75|But whoever shall appear before him, having been a true believer, and shall have worked righteousness, for these are prepared the highest degrees of happiness
20|76|namely, gardens of perpetual abode, which shall be watered by rivers; they shall remain therein for ever: And this shall be the reward of him who shall be pure
20|77|And we spake by revelation unto Moses, saying, go forth with my servants out of Egypt by night; and smite the waters with thy rod, and make them a dry path through the sea: Be not apprehensive of Pharaoh's overtaking thee; neither be thou afraid
20|78|And when Moses had done so, Pharaoh followed them with his forces; and the waters of the sea which overwhelmed them, overwhelmed them
20|79|And Pharaoh caused his people to err, neither did he direct them aright
20|80|Thus, O children of Israel, we delivered you from your enemy; and we appointed you the right side of mount Sinai to discourse with Moses and to give him the law; and we caused manna and quails to descend upon you
20|81|saying, eat of the good things which we have given you for food; and transgress not therein, lest my indignation fall on you: And on whomsoever my indignation shall fall, he shall go down headlong into perdition
20|82|But I will be gracious unto him who shall repent and believe, and shall do that which is right; and who shall be rightly directed
20|83|What hath caused thee to hasten from thy people, O Moses, to receive the law
20|84|He answered, these follow close on my footsteps; but I have hastened unto thee, O Lord, that thou mightest be well pleased with me
20|85|God said, we have already made a trial of thy people, since thy departure; and al Sameri hath seduced them to idolatry
20|86|Wherefore Moses returned unto his people in great wrath, and exceedingly afflicted. And he said, O my people, had not your Lord promised you a most excellent promise? Did the time of my absence seem long unto you? Or did ye desire that indignation from your Lord should fall on you, and therefore failed to keep the promise which ye made me
20|87|They answered, we have not failed in what we promised thee of our own authority; but we were made to carry in several loads of gold and silver, of the ornaments of the people, and we cast them into the fire; and in like manner al Sameri also cast in what he had collected
20|88|and he produced unto them a corporeal calf, which lowed. And al Sameri and his companions said, this is your god, and the god of Moses; but he hath forgotten him, and is gone to seek some other
20|89|Did they not therefore see that their idol returned them no answer, and was not able to cause them either hurt or profit
20|90|And Aaron had said unto them before, O my people, verily ye are only proved by this calf; for your Lord is the Merciful: Wherefore follow me, and obey my command
20|91|They answered, we will by no means cease to be devoted to its worship, until Moses return unto us
20|92|And when Moses was returned, he said, O Aaron, what hindered thee, when thou sawest that they went astray
20|93|that thou didst not follow me? Hast thou therefore been disobedient to my command
20|94|Aaron answered, O son of my mother, drag me not by my beard, nor by the hair of my head. Verily I feared lest thou shouldest say, thou hast made a division among the children of Israel, and thou hast not observed my saying
20|95|Moses said unto al Sameri, what was thy design, O Sameri
20|96|He answered, I saw that which they saw not; wherefore I took a handful of dust from the footsteps of the messenger of God, and I cast it into the molten calf; for so did my mind direct me
20|97|Moses said, get thee gone; for thy punishment in this life shall be, that thou shalt say unto those who shall meet thee, touch me not; and a threat is denounced against thee of more terrible pains, in the life to come, which thou shalt by no means escape. And behold now thy god, to whose worship thou hast continued assiduously devoted: Verily we will burn it; and we will reduce it to powder, and scatter it in the sea
20|98|Your God is the true God, besides whom there is no other god: He comprehendeth all things by his knowledge
20|99|Thus do we recite unto thee, O Mohammed, relations of what hath passed heretofore; and we have given thee an admonition from us
20|100|He who shall turn aside from it, shall surely carry a load of guilt on the day of resurrection
20|101|They shall continue thereunder for ever; and a grievous burden shall it be unto them on the day of resurrection
20|102|On that day the trumpet shall be sounded; and we will gather the wicked together on that day, having grey eyes
20|103|They shall speak with a low voice to one another, saying, ye have not tarried above ten days
20|104|We well know what they will say; when the most conspicuous among them for behaviour shall say, ye have not tarried above one day
20|105|They will ask thee concerning the mountains: Answer, my Lord will reduce them to dust, and scatter them abroad
20|106|and he will leave them a plain equally extended
20|107|Thou shalt see no part of them higher or lower than another
20|108|On that day mankind shall follow the angel who will call them to judgment, none shall have power to turn aside from him; and their voices shall be low before the Merciful, neither shalt thou hear any more than the hollow sound of their feet
20|109|On that day the intercession of none shall be of advantage unto another, except the intercession of him to whom the Merciful shall grant permission, and who shall be acceptable unto him in what he saith
20|110|God knoweth that which is before them, and that which is behind them; but they comprehend not the same by their knowledge
20|111|And their faces shall be humbled before the living, the self-subsisting God; and he shall be wretched who shall bear his iniquity
20|112|But whosoever shall do good works, being a true believer, shall not fear any injustice, or any diminution of his reward from God
20|113|And thus have we sent down this book, being a Koran in the Arabic tongue; and we have inserted various threats and promises therein, that men may fear God, or that it may awaken some consideration in them
20|114|Wherefore let God be highly exalted, the king, the truth! Be not overhasty in receiving or repeating the Koran, before the revelation thereof be completed unto thee; and say, Lord, increase my knowledge
20|115|We heretofore gave a command unto Adam; but he forgot the same, and ate of the forbidden fruit; and we found not in him a firm resolution
20|116|And remember when we said unto the angels, worship ye Adam; and they worshipped him: But Eblis refused
20|117|And we said, O Adam, verily this is an enemy unto thee, and thy wife: Wherefore beware lest he turn you out of paradise; for then shalt thou be miserable
20|118|Verily we have made a provision for thee, that thou shalt not hunger therein, neither shalt thou be naked
20|119|And there is also a provision made for thee, that thou shalt not thirst therein, neither shalt thou be incommoded by heat
20|120|But Satan whispered evil suggestions unto him, saying, O Adam, shall I guide thee to the tree of eternity, and a kingdom which faileth not
20|121|And they both ate thereof: And their nakedness appeared unto them; and they began to sew together the leaves of paradise, to cover themselves. And thus Adam became disobedient unto his Lord, and was seduced
20|122|Afterwards his Lord accepted him, on his repentance, and was turned unto him, and directed him
20|123|And God said, get ye down hence, all of you: The one of you shall be an enemy unto the other. But hereafter shall a direction come unto you from me: And whosoever shall follow my direction, shall not err, neither shall he be unhappy
20|124|but whosoever shall turn aside from my admonition, verily he shall lead a miserable life, and we will cause him to appear before us on the day of resurrection, blind
20|125|And he shall say, O Lord, why hast thou brought me before thee blind, whereas before I saw clearly
20|126|God shall answer, thus have we done, because our signs came unto thee, and thou didst forget them; and in the same manner shalt thou be forgotten this day
20|127|And thus will we reward him who shall be negligent, and shall not believe in the signs of his Lord: And the punishment of the life to come shall be more severe, and more lasting, than the punishment of this life
20|128|Are not the Meccans therefore acquainted how many generations we have destroyed before them; in whose dwellings they walk? Verily herein are signs unto those who are indued with understanding
20|129|And unless a decree had previously gone forth from thy Lord for their respite, verily their destruction had necessarily followed: But there is a certain time determined by God for their punishment
20|130|Wherefore do thou, O Mohammed, patiently bear that which they say; and celebrate the praise of thy Lord before the rising of the sun, and before the setting thereof, and praise him in the hours of the night, and in the extremities of the day, that thou mayest be well pleased with the prospect of receiving favour from God
20|131|And cast not thine eyes on that which we have granted divers of the unbelievers to enjoy, namely, the splendor of this present life, that we may prove them thereby: For the provision of thy Lord is better, and more permanent
20|132|Command thy family to observe prayer; and do thou persevere therein. We require not of thee that thou labour to gain necessary provisions for thyself and family: We will provide for thee; for the prosperous issue shall attend on piety
20|133|The unbelievers say, unless he come unto us with a sign from his Lord, we will not believe on him. Hath not a plain declaration come unto them, of that which is contained in the former volumes of scripture, by the revelation of the Koran
20|134|If we had destroyed them by a judgment before the same had been revealed, they would have said, at the resurrection, O Lord, how could we believe since thou didst not send unto us an apostle, that we might follow thy signs, before we were humbled and covered with shame
20|135|Say, each of us wait the issue: Wait therefore; for ye shall surely know hereafter who have been the followers of the even way, and who hath been rightly directed
21|1|The time of giving up their account draweth nigh unto the people of Mecca; while they are sunk in negligence, turning aside from the consideration thereof
21|2|No admonition cometh unto them from their Lord, being lately revealed in the Koran, but when they hear it, they turn it to sport
21|3|Their hearts are taken up with delights. And they who act unjustly discourse privately together, saying, is this Mohammed any more than a man like yourselves? Will ye therefore come to hear a piece of sorcery, when ye plainly perceive it to be so
21|4|Say, my Lord knoweth whatever is spoken in heaven and on earth: It is He who heareth and knoweth
21|5|But they say, the Koran is a confused heap of dreams: Nay, he hath forged it; nay, he is a poet: Let him come unto us therefore with some miracle, in like manner as the former prophets were sent
21|6|None of the cities which We have destroyed, believed the miracles which they saw performed, before them: Will these therefore believe, if they see a miracle
21|7|We sent none as our apostles before thee, other than men, unto whom We revealed our will. Ask those who are acquainted with the scripture, if ye know not this
21|8|We gave them not a body which could be supported without their eating food; neither were they immortal
21|9|But We made good our promise unto them: Wherefore We delivered them, and those whom We pleased; but We destroyed the exorbitant transgressors
21|10|Now have We sent down unto you, O Koreish, the book of the Koran; wherein there is honourable mention of you: Will ye not therefore understand
21|11|And how many cities have We overthrown, which were ungodly; and caused other nations to rise up after them
21|12|And when they felt our severe vengeance, behold, they fled swiftly from those cities
21|13|And the angels said, scoffingly, unto them, do not fly; but return to that wherein ye delighted, and to your habitations: Peradventure ye will be asked
21|14|They answered, alas for us! Verily we have been unjust
21|15|And this their lamentation ceased not, until we had rendered them like corn which is mowen down, and utterly extinct
21|16|We created not the heavens and the earth, and that which is between them, by way of sport
21|17|If We had pleased to take diversion, verily We had taken it with that which beseemeth Us; if We had resolved to have done this
21|18|But We will oppose truth to vanity, and it shall confound the same; and behold, it shall vanish away. Woe be unto you, for that which ye impiously utter concerning God
21|19|Since whoever is in heaven and on earth is subject unto Him; and the angels who are in his presence do not insolently disdain his service, neither are they tired therewith
21|20|They praise Him night and day: They faint not
21|21|Have they taken gods from the earth? Shall they raise the dead to life
21|22|If there were either in heaven or on earth gods besides God, verily both would be corrupted. But far be that which they utter, from God, the Lord of the throne
21|23|No account shall be demanded of Him for what He shall do; but an account shall be demanded of them
21|24|Have they taken other gods besides Him? Say, produce your proof thereof. This is the admonition of those who are contemporary with me, and the admonition of those who have been before me: But the greater part of them know not the truth, and turn aside from the same
21|25|We have sent no apostle before thee, but We revealed unto him that there is no god besides myself: Wherefore serve Me
21|26|They say, the Merciful hath begotten issue; and the angels are his daughters. God forbid! They are his honoured servants
21|27|They prevent Him not in any thing which they say; and they execute his command
21|28|He knoweth that which is before them, and that which is behind them: They shall not intercede for any, except for whom it shall please Him; and they tremble for fear of Him
21|29|Whoever of them shall say, I am a god besides Him; that angel will We reward with hell: For so will We reward the unjust
21|30|Do not the unbelievers therefore know, that the heavens and the earth were solid, and We clave the same in sunder; and made every living thing of water? Will they not therefore believe
21|31|And We placed stable mountains on the earth, lest it should move with them; and We made broad passages between them for paths, that they might be directed in their journeys
21|32|And We made the heaven a roof well supported. Yet they turn aside from the signs thereof, not considering that they are the workmanship of God
21|33|It is He who hath created the night, and the day, and the sun, and the moon; all the celestial bodies move swiftly, each in its respective orb
21|34|We have not granted unto any man before thee, eternal permanency in this world; if thou die therefore, will they be immortal
21|35|Every soul shall taste of death: And We will prove you with evil, and with good, for a trial of you; and unto Us shall ye return
21|36|When the unbelievers see thee, they receive thee only with scoffing, saying, is this he who mentioneth your gods with contempt? Yet themselves believe not what is mentioned to them of the Merciful
21|37|Man is created of precipitation. Hereafter will I shew you my signs, so that ye shall not wish them to be hastened
21|38|They say, when will this threat be accomplished, if ye speak truth
21|39|If they who believe not, knew that the time will surely come, then they shall not be able to drive back the fire of hell from their faces, nor from their backs, neither shall they be helped, they would not hasten it
21|40|But the day of vengeance shall come upon them suddenly, and shall strike them with astonishment: They shall not be able to avert it; neither shall they be respited
21|41|Other apostles have been mocked before thee: But the punishment which they scoffed at, fell upon such of them as mocked
21|42|Say unto the scoffers, who shall save you by night and by day from the Merciful? Yet they utterly neglect the remembrance of their Lord
21|43|Have they gods who will defend them, besides us? They are not able to help themselves; neither shall they be assisted against us by their companions
21|44|But We have permitted these men and their fathers to enjoy worldly prosperity, so long as life was continued unto them. Do they not perceive that We come unto the land of the unbelievers, and straiten the borders thereof? Shall they therefore be the conquerors
21|45|Say, I only preach unto you the revelation of God: But the deaf will not hear thy call, whenever they are preached unto
21|46|Yet if the least breath of the punishment of thy Lord touch them, they will surely say, alas for us! Verily we have been unjust
21|47|We will appoint just balances for the day of resurrection; neither shall any soul be injured at all: Although the merit or guilt of an action be of the weight of a grain of mustard-seed only, We will produce it publicly; and there will be sufficient accountants with Us
21|48|We formerly gave unto Moses and Aaron the law, being a distinction between good and evil, and a light and admonition unto the pious
21|49|who fear their Lord in secret, and who dread the hour of judgment
21|50|And this book also is a blessed admonition; which We have sent down from heaven: Will ye therefore deny it
21|51|And We gave unto Abraham his direction heretofore, and We knew him to be worthy of the revelations wherewith he was favoured
21|52|Remember when he said unto his father, and his people, what are these images, to which ye are so entirely devoted
21|53|They answered, we found our fathers worshipping them
21|54|He said, verily both ye and your fathers have been in a manifest error
21|55|They said, dost thou seriously tell us the truth, or art thou one who jestest with us
21|56|He replied, verily your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; it is He who hath created them: And I am one of those who bear witness thereof
21|57|By God, I will surely devise a plot against your idols, after ye shall have retired from them, and shall have turned your backs
21|58|And in the peoples absence he went into the temple where the idols stood, and he brake them all in pieces, except the biggest of them; that they might lay the blame upon that. And when they were returned
21|59|and saw the havock which had been made, they said, who hath done this to our gods? He is certainly an impious person
21|60|And certain of them answered, we heard a young man speak reproachfully of them: He is named Abraham
21|61|They said, bring him therefore before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness against him
21|62|And when he was brought before the assembly, they said unto him, hast thou done this unto our gods, O Abraham
21|63|He answered, nay, that biggest of them hath done it: But ask them, if they can speak
21|64|And they returned unto themselves, and said the one to the other, verily ye are the impious persons
21|65|Afterwards they relapsed into their former obstinacy, and said, verily thou knowest that these speak not
21|66|Abraham answered, do ye therefore worship, besides God, that which cannot profit you at all, neither can it hurt you
21|67|Fie on you; and upon that which ye worship besides God! Do ye not understand
21|68|They said, burn him, and avenge your gods: If ye do this it will be well
21|69|And when Abraham was cast into the burning pile, We said, O fire, be thou cold, and a preservation unto Abraham
21|70|And they sought to lay a plot against him: But We caused them to be the sufferers
21|71|And We delivered him, and Lot, by bringing them into the land wherein We have blessed all creatures
21|72|And We bestowed on him Isaac, and Jacob, as an additional gift: And We made all of them rightous persons
21|73|We also made them models of religion, that they might direct others by our command: And We inspired into them the doing of good works, and the observance of prayer, and the giving of alms; and they served us
21|74|And unto Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and We delivered him out of the city which committed filthy crimes; for they were a wicked and insolent people
21|75|And We led him into our mercy; for he was an upright person
21|76|And remember Noah, when he called for destruction on his people, before the prophets abovementioned; and We heard him, and delivered him and his family from a great strait
21|77|And We protected him from the people who accused our signs of falsehood; for they were a wicked people, wherefore We drowned them all
21|78|And remember David, and Solomon, when they pronounced judgment concerning a field, when the sheep of certain people had fed therein by night, having no shepherd; and We were witnesses of their judgment
21|79|And We gave the understanding thereof unto Solomon. And on all of them We bestowed wisdom, and knowledge. And We compelled the mountains to praise Us with David; and the birds also: And We did this
21|80|And We taught him the art of making coats of mail for you, that they may defend you in your wars: Will ye therefore be thankful
21|81|And unto Solomon We subjected a strong wind; it ran at his command to the land whereon We had bestowed our blessing: And We knew all things
21|82|And We also subjected unto his command divers of the devils, who might dive to get pearls for him, and perform other work besides this; and We watched over them
21|83|And remember Job; when he cried unto his Lord, saying, verily evil hath afflicted me: But thou art the most merciful of those who shew mercy
21|84|Wherefore We heard him, and relieved him from the evil which was upon him: And We restored unto him his family, and as many more with them, through our mercy, and for an admonition unto those who serve God
21|85|And remember Ismael, and Edris, and Dhu'lkefl. All these were patient persons
21|86|Wherefore We led them into our mercy; for they were righteous doers
21|87|And remember Dhu'lnun, when he departed in wrath, and thought that We could not exercise our power over him. And he cried out in the darkness, saying, there is no God, besides Thee: Praise be unto Thee! Verily I have been one of the unjust
21|88|Wherefore We heard him, and delivered him from affliction: For so do We deliver the true believers
21|89|And remember Zacharias, when he called upon his Lord, saying, O Lord, leave me not childless: Yet thou art the best heir
21|90|Wherefore We heard him, and We gave him John; and We rendered his wife fit for bearing a child unto him. These strove to excel in good works, and called upon us with love, and with fear; and humbled themselves before us
21|91|And remember her who preserved her virginity, and into whom We breathed of our spirit; ordaining her and her son for a sign unto all creatures
21|92|Verily this your religion is one religion; and I am your Lord; wherefore serve Me
21|93|But the Jews and Christians have made schisms in the affair of their religion among themselves: But all of them shall appear before us
21|94|Whosoever shall do good works, being a true believer, there shall be no denial of the reward due to his endeavours; and We will surely write it down unto him
21|95|An inviolable prohibition is laid on every city which We shall have destroyed
21|96|for that they shall not return any more into the world; until Gog and Magog shall have a passage opened for them, and they shall hasten from every high hill
21|97|and the certain promise shall draw near to be fulfilled: And behold, the eyes of the infidels shall be fixed with astonishment, and they shall say, alas for us! We were formerly regardless of this day; yea, we were wicked doers
21|98|Verily both ye, O men of Mecca, and the idols which ye worship besides God, shall be cast as fuel into hell fire: Ye shall go down into the same
21|99|If these were really gods, they would not go down into the same: And all of them shall remain therein for ever
21|100|In that place shall they groan for anguish; and they shall not hear ought therein
21|101|As for those unto whom the most excellent reward of paradise hath been predestinated by us, they shall be transported far off from the same
21|102|they shall not hear the least sound thereof: And they shall continue for ever in the felicity which their souls desire
21|103|The greatest terror shall not trouble them, and the angels shall meet them to congratulate them, saying, this is your day which ye were promised
21|104|On that day We will roll up the heavens, as the angel al Sijil rolleth up the book wherein every man's actions are recorded. As We made the first creature out of nothing, so We will also reproduce it at the resurrection. This is a promise which it lieth on Us to fulfil: We will surely perform it
21|105|And now have We written in the psalms, after the promulgation of the law, that my servants the righteous shall inherit the earth
21|106|Verily in this book are contained sufficient means of salvation, unto people who serve God
21|107|We have not sent thee, O Mohammed, but as a mercy unto all creatures
21|108|Say, no other hath been revealed unto me, than that your God is one God: Will ye therefore be resigned unto Him
21|109|But if they turn their backs to the confession of God's unity, say, I proclaim war against you all equally: But I know not whether that which ye are theatened with be nigh, or whether it be far distant
21|110|Verily God knoweth the discourse which is spoken in public; and He also knoweth that which ye hold in private
21|111|I know not but peradventure the respite granted you is for a trial of you; and that ye may enjoy the prosperity of this world for a time
21|112|Say, Lord, judge between me and my adversaries with truth. Our Lord is the Merciful; whose assistance is to be implored against the blasphemies and calumnies which ye utter
22|1|O men of Mecca, fear your Lord. Verily the shock of the last hour will be a terrible thing
22|2|On the day whereon ye shall see it, every woman who giveth suck shall forget the infant which she suckleth, and every female that is with young shall cast her burden; and thou shalt see men seemingly drunk, yet they shall not be really drunk: But the punishment of God will be severe
22|3|There is a man who disputeth concerning God without knowledge, and followeth every rebellious devil
22|4|Against whom it is written, that whoever shall take him for his patron, he shall surely seduce him, and shall lead him into the torment of hell
22|5|O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that We first created you of the dust of the ground; afterwards, of seed; afterwards, of a little coagulated blood; afterwards, of a piece of flesh, perfectly formed in part, and in part imperfectly formed; that We might make our power manifest unto you: And We cause that which We please to rest in the wombs, until the appointed time of delivery. Then We bring you forth infants; and afterwards We permit you to attain your age of full strength: And one of you dieth in his youth, and another of you is postponed to a decrepit age, so that he forgetteth whatever he knew. Thou seest the earth sometimes dried up and barren: But when We send down rain thereon, it is put in motion, and swelleth, and produceth every kind of luxuriant vegetables
22|6|This sheweth that God is the truth, and that He raiseth the dead to life, and that He is almighty
22|7|and that the hour of judgment will surely come, (there is no doubt thereof), and that God will raise again those who are in the graves
22|8|There is a man who disputeth concerning God without either knowledge, or a direction, or an enlightening book
22|9|proudly turning his side, that he may seduce men from the way of God. Ignominy shall attend him in this world; and on the day of resurrection We will make him taste the torment of burning
22|10|when it shall be said unto him, this thou sufferest because of that which thy hands have formerly committed; for God is not unjust towards mankind
22|11|There are some men who serve God in a wavering manner, standing, as it were, on the verge of the true religion. If good befall one of them, he resteth satisfied therein; but if any tribulation befall him, he turneth himself round, with the loss both of this world, and of the life to come. This is manifest perdition
22|12|He will call upon that, besides God, which can neither hurt him, nor profit him. This is an error remote from truth
22|13|He will invoke him who will sooner be of hurt to his worshipper than of advantage. Such is surely a miserable patron, and a miserable companion
22|14|But God will introduce those who shall believe, and do righteous works, into gardens through which rivers flow; for God doth that which He pleaseth
22|15|Whoso thinketh that God will not assist his apostle in this world, and in the world to come, let him strain a rope towards heaven, then let him put an end to his life, and see whether his devices can render that ineffectual, for which he was angry
22|16|Thus do We send down the Koran, being evident signs; for God directeth whom He pleaseth
22|17|As to the true believers, and those who judaize, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and Magians, and the idolaters; verily God shall judge between them on the day of resurrection; for God is witness of all things
22|18|Dost thou not perceive that all creatures both in heaven and on earth adore God; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the beasts, and many men? But many are worthy of chastisement: And whomsoever God shall render despicable, there shall be none to honour; for God doth that which He pleaseth
22|19|These are two opposite parties, who dispute concerning their Lord. And they who believe not, shall have garments of fire fitted unto them: boiling water shall be poured on their heads
22|20|their bowels shall be dissolved thereby, and also their skins
22|21|and they shall be beaten with maces of iron
22|22|So often as they shall endeavour to get out of hell, because of the anguish of their torments, they shall be dragged back into the same; and their tormentors shall say unto them, taste ye the pain of burning
22|23|God will introduce those who shall believe, and act righteously, into gardens through which rivers flow: They shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and pearls; and their vestures therein shall be silk
22|24|They are directed unto a good saying; and are directed into the honourable way
22|25|But they who shall disbelieve, and obstruct the way of God, and hinder men from visiting the holy temple of Mecca, which We have appointed for a place of worship unto all men: The inhabitant thereof, and the stranger have an equal right to visit it: And whosoever shall seek impiously to profane it, We will cause him to taste a grievous torment
22|26|Call to mind when We gave the site of the house of the Caaba for an abode unto Abraham, saying, do not associate any thing with Me; and cleanse my house for those who compass it, and who stand up, and who bow down to worship
22|27|And proclaim unto the people a solemn pilgrimage; let them come unto thee on foot, and on every lean camel, arriving from every distant road
22|28|that they may be witnesses of the advantages which accrew to them from the visiting this holy place, and may commemorate the name of God on the appointed days, in gratitude for the brute cattle which He hath bestowed on them. Wherefore eat thereof, and feed the needy, and the poor
22|29|Afterwards let them put an end to the neglect of their persons; and let them pay their vows, and compass the ancient house
22|30|This let them do. And whoever shall regard the sacred ordinances of God; this will be better for him in the sight of his Lord. All sorts of cattle are allowed you to eat, except what hath been read unto you, in former passages of the Koran, to be forbidden. But depart from the abomination of idols, and avoid speaking that which is false: Being orthodox in respect to God
22|31|associating no other god with Him; for whoever associateth any other with God, is like that which falleth from heaven, and which the birds snatch away, or the wind bloweth to a far distant place
22|32|This is so. And whoso maketh valuable offerings unto God; verily they proceed from the piety of men's hearts
22|33|Ye receive various advantages from the cattle designed for sacrifices, until a determined time for slaying them: Then the place of sacrificing them is at the ancient house
22|34|Unto the professors of every religion have We appointed certain rites, that they may commemorate the name of God on slaying the brute cattle which He hath provided for them. Your God is one God: Wherefore resign your selves wholly unto Him. And do thou bear good tidings unto those who humble themselves
22|35|whose hearts, when mention is made of God, are struck with fear; and unto those who patiently endure that which befalleth them; and who duely perform their prayers, and give alms out of what We have bestowed on them
22|36|The camels slain for sacrifice have We appointed for you as symbols of your obedience unto God: Ye also receive other advantages from them. Wherefore commemorate the name of God over them, when ye slay them, standing on their feet disposed in right order: And when they are fallen down dead, eat of them; and give to eat thereof both unto him who is content with what is given him, without asking, and unto him who asketh. Thus have We given you dominion over them, that ye might return Us thanks
22|37|Their flesh is not accepted of God, neither their blood; but your piety is accepted of Him. Thus have We given you dominion over them, that ye might magnify God, for the revelations whereby He hath directed you. And bear good tidings unto the righteous
22|38|that God will repel the ill designs of the infidels from the true believers; for God loveth not every perfidious unbeliever
22|39|Permission is granted unto those who take arms against the unbelievers, for that they have been unjustly persecuted by them: -- (and God is certainly able to assist them)
22|40|Who have been turned out of their habitations injuriously, and for no other reason than because they say, our Lord is God. And if God did not repel the violence of some men by others, verily monasteries, and churches, and synagogues, and the temples of the Moslems, wherein the name of God is frequently commemorated, would be utterly demolished. And God will certainly assist him who shall be on his side: For God is strong and mighty
22|41|And He will assist those who, if We establish them in the earth, will observe prayer, and give alms, and command that which is just, and forbid that which is unjust. And unto God shall be the end of all things
22|42|If they accuse thee, O Mohammed, of imposture; consider that, before them, the people of Noah, and the tribes of Ad and Thamud
22|43|and the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot
22|44|and the inhabitants of Madian, accused their prophets of imposture: And Moses was also charged with falsehood. And I granted a long respite unto the unbelievers: But afterwards I chastised them; and how different was the change I made in their condition
22|45|How many cities have We destroyed, which were ungodly, and which are now fallen to ruin on their roofs? And how many wells have been abandoned, and lofty castles
22|46|Do they not therefore journey through the land? And have they not hearts to understand with, or ears to hear with? Surely as to these things their eyes are not blind, but the hearts are blind which are in their breasts
22|47|They will urge thee to hasten the threatened punishment; but God will not fail to perform what He hath threatened: And verily one day with thy Lord is as a thousand years, of those which ye compute
22|48|Unto how many cities have I granted respite, though they were wicked? Yet afterwards I chastised them: And unto Me shall they come to be judged, at the last day
22|49|Say, O men, verily I am only a public preacher unto you
22|50|And they who believe, and do good works, shall obtain forgiveness and an honourable provision
22|51|But those who endeavour to make our signs of none effect, shall be the inhabitants, of hell
22|52|We have sent no apostle, or prophet, before thee, but, when he read, Satan suggested some error in his reading. But God shall make void that which Satan hath suggested: Then shall God confirm his signs; for God is knowing and wise
22|53|But this He permitteth, that He may make that which Satan hath suggested, a temptation unto those in whose hearts there is an infirmity, and whose hearts are hardened: -- for the ungodly are certainly in a wide disagreement from the truth
22|54|And that they on whom knowledge hath been bestowed, may know that this book is the truth from thy Lord, and may believe therein; and that their hearts may acquiesce in the same: For God is surely the director of those who believe, into the right way
22|55|But the infidels will not cease to doubt concerning it, until the hour of judgment cometh suddenly upon them; or until the punishment of a grievous day overtake them
22|56|On that day the kingdom shall be God's: He shall judge between them. And they who shall have believed, and shall have wrought righteousness, shall be in gardens of pleasure
22|57|But they who shall have disbelieved, and shall have charged our signs with falsehood, those shall suffer a shameful punishment
22|58|And as to those who shall have fled their country for the sake of God's true religion, and afterwards shall have been slain, or shall have died; on them will God bestow an excellent provision; and God is the best provider
22|59|He will surely introduce them with an introduction with which they shall be well-pleased: For God is knowing and gracious
22|60|This is so. Whoever shall take a vengeance equal to the injury which hath been done him, and shall afterwards be unjustly treated; verily God will assist him: For God is merciful, and ready to forgive
22|61|This shall be done, for that God causeth the night to succeed the day, and He causeth the day to succeed the night; and for that God both heareth and seeth
22|62|This, because God is truth, and because what they invoke besides Him, is vanity; and for that God is the high, the mighty
22|63|Dost thou not see that God sendeth down water from heaven, and the earth becometh green? For God is gracious and wise
22|64|Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth: And God is self-sufficient, worthy to be praised
22|65|Dost thou not see that God hath subjected whatever is in the earth to your service, and also the ships which sail in the sea, by his command? And He with-holdeth the heaven that it fall not on the earth, unless by his permission: For God is gracious unto mankind, and merciful
22|66|It is He who hath given you life, and will hereafter cause you to die; afterwards He will again raise you to life, at the resurrection: But man is surely ungrateful
22|67|Unto the professors of every religion have We appointed certain rites, which they observe. Let them not therefore dispute with thee concerning this matter; but invite them unto thy Lord: For thou followest the right direction
22|68|But if they enter into debate with thee, answer, God well knoweth that which ye do
22|69|God will judge between you, on the day of resurrection, concerning that wherein ye now disagree
22|70|Dost thou not know that God knoweth whatever is in heaven and on earth? Verily this is written in the book of his decrees: This is easy with God
22|71|They worship, besides God, that concerning which He hath sent down no convincing proof, and concerning which they have no knowledge: But the unjust doers shall have none to assist them
22|72|And when our evident signs are rehearsed unto them, thou mayest perceive, in the countenances of the unbelievers, a disdain thereof: It wanteth little but that they rush with violence on those who rehearse our signs unto them. Say, shall I declare unto you a worse thing than this? The fire of hell, which God hath threatened unto those who believe not, is worse; and an unhappy journey shall it be thither
22|73|O men, a parable is propounded unto you; wherefore hearken unto it. Verily the idols which ye invoke, besides God, can never create a single fly, although they were all assembled for that purpose: And if the fly snatch any thing from them, they cannot recover the same from it. Weak is the petitioner, and the petitioned
22|74|They judge not of God according to his due estimation: For God is powerful and mighty
22|75|God chooseth messengers from among the angels, and from among men: For God is He who heareth and seeth
22|76|He knoweth that which is before them, and that which is behind them: And unto God shall all things return
22|77|O true believers, bow down, and prostrate your selves, and worship your Lord; and work righteousness, that ye may be happy
22|78|And fight in defence of God's true religion, as it behoveth you to fight for the same. He hath chosen you, and hath not imposed on you any difficulty in the religion which He hath given you, the religion of your father Abraham: He hath named you Moslems heretofore, and in this book; that our apostle may be a witness against you at the day of judgment, and that ye may be witnesses against the rest of mankind. Wherefore be ye constant at prayer; and give alms: And adhere firmly unto God. He is your master; and He is the best master, and the best protector
23|1|Now are the true believers happy
23|2|Who humble themselves in their prayer
23|3|and who eschew all vain discourse
23|4|and who are doers of alms-deeds
23|5|and who keep themselves from carnal knowledge of any women
23|6|except their wives, or the captives which their right hands possess; -- for as to them they shall be blameless
23|7|But whoever coveteth any woman beyond these, they are transgressors
23|8|And who acquit themselves faithfully of their trust, and justly perform their covenant
23|9|and who observe their appointed times of prayer
23|10|These shall be the heirs
23|11|who shall inherit paradise; they shall continue therein for ever
23|12|We formerly created man of a finer sort of clay
23|13|afterwards We placed him in the form of seed in a sure receptacle
23|14|Afterwards We made the seed coagulated blood; and We formed the coagulated blood into a piece of flesh: Then We formed the piece of flesh into bones; and We cloathed those bones with flesh: Then We produced the same by another creation. Wherefore blessed be God, the most excellent creator
23|15|After this shall ye die
23|16|And afterwards shall ye be restored to life, on the day of resurrection
23|17|And We have created over you seven heavens: And We are not negligent of what We have created
23|18|And We send down rain from heaven, by measure; and We cause it to remain on the earth: We are also certainly able to deprive you of the same
23|19|And We cause gardens of palm-trees, and vineyards, to spring forth for you by means thereof; wherein ye have many fruits, and whereof ye eat
23|20|And We also raise for you a tree springing from mount Sinai; which produceth oil, and a sauce for those who eat
23|21|Ye have likewise an instruction in the cattle: We give you to drink of the milk which is in their bellies, and ye receive many advantages from them; and of them do ye eat
23|22|And on them, and on ships, are ye carried
23|23|We sent Noah heretofore unto his people, and he said, O my people, serve God: Ye have no God besides Him; will ye not therefore fear the consequence of your worshipping other gods
23|24|And the chiefs of his people, who believed not, said, this is no other than a man, as ye are: He seeketh to raise himself to a superiority over you. If God had pleased to have sent a messenger unto you, He would surely have sent angels: We have not heard this of our forefathers
23|25|Verily he is no other than a man disturbed with frenzy: Wherefore wait concerning him for a time
23|26|Noah said, O Lord, do thou protect me; for that they accuse me of falsehood
23|27|And We revealed our orders unto him, saying, make the ark in our sight; and according to our revelation. And when our decree cometh to be executed, and the oven shall boil and pour forth water, carry into it of every species of animals one pair; and also thy family, except such of them on whom a previous sentence of destruction hath passed: And speak not unto Me in behalf of those who have been unjust; for they shall be drowned
23|28|And when thou and they who shall be with thee, shall go up into the ark, say, praise be unto God, who hath delivered us from the ungodly people
23|29|And say, O Lord, cause me to come down from this ark with a blessed descent; for thou art best able to bring me down from the same with safety
23|30|Verily herein were signs of our omnipotence; and We proved mankind thereby
23|31|Afterwards We raised up another generation after them
23|32|and We sent unto them an apostle from among them, who said, worship God: Ye have no God besides Him; will ye not therefore fear his vengeance
23|33|And the chiefs of his people, who believed not, and who denied the meeting of the life to come, and on whom We had bestowed affluence in this present life, said, this is not other than a man, as ye are; he eateth of that whereof ye eat, and he drinketh of that whereof ye drink
23|34|And if ye obey a man like unto your selves, ye will surely be sufferers
23|35|Doth he threaten you that after ye shall be dead, and shall become dust and bones, ye shall be brought forth alive from your graves
23|36|Away, away with that ye are threatened with
23|37|There is no other life besides our present life: We die, and we live; and we shall not be raised again
23|38|This is no other than a man, who deviseth a lie concerning God: But we will not believe him
23|39|Their apostle said, O Lord, defend me; for that they have accused me of imposture
23|40|God answered, after a little while they shall surely repent their obstinacy
23|41|Wherefore a severe punishment was justly inflicted on them, and We rendered them like the refuse which is carried down by a stream. Away therefore with the ungodly people
23|42|Afterwards We raised up other generations after them
23|43|No nation shall be punished before their determined time; neither shall they be respited after
23|44|Afterwards We sent our apostles, one after another. So often as their apostle came unto any nation, they charged him with imposture: And We caused them successively to follow one another to destruction; and We made them only subjects of traditional stories. Away therefore with the unbelieving nations
23|45|Afterwards We sent Moses, and Aaron his brother, with our signs and manifest power
23|46|unto Pharaoh and his princes: But they proudly refused to believe on him; for they were a haughty people
23|47|And they said, shall we believe on two men like unto our selves; whose people are our servants
23|48|And they accused them of imposture: Wherefore they became of the number of those who were destroyed
23|49|And We heretofore gave the book of the law unto Moses, that the children of Israel might be directed thereby
23|50|And We appointed the son of Mary, and his mother, for a sign: And We prepared an abode for them in an elevated part of the earth, being a place of quiet and security, and watered with running springs
23|51|O apostles eat of those things which are good; and work righteousness: for I well know that which ye do
23|52|This your religion is one religion; and I am your Lord: Wherefore fear Me
23|53|But men have rent the affair of their religion into various sects: Every party rejoiceth in that which they follow
23|54|Wherefore leave them in their confusion, until a certain time
23|55|Do they think that We hasten unto them the wealth and children, which We have abundantly bestowed on them
23|56|for their good? But they do not understand
23|57|Verily they who stand in awe, for fear of their Lord
23|58|and who believe in the signs of their Lord
23|59|and who attribute not companions unto their Lord
23|60|and who give that which they give in alms, their hearts being struck with dread, for that they must return unto their Lord
23|61|These hasten unto good, and are foremost to obtain the same
23|62|We will not impose any difficulty on a soul, except according to its ability; with us is a book, which speaketh the truth; and they shall not be injured
23|63|But their hearts are drowned in negligence, as to this matter; and they have works different from those We have mentioned; which they will continue to do, until
23|64|when We chastise such of them as enjoy an affluence of fortune, by a severe punishment, behold, they cry aloud for help
23|65|But it shall be answered them, cry not for help to day: For ye shall not be assisted by Us
23|66|My signs were read unto you, but ye turned back on your heels
23|67|Proudly elating your selves because of your possessing the holy temple; discoursing together by night, and talking foolishly
23|68|Do they not therefore attentively consider that which is spoken unto them; whether a revelation is come unto them which came not unto their forefathers
23|69|Or do they not know their apostle; and therefore reject him
23|70|Or do they say, he is a madman? Nay, he hath come unto them with the truth; but the greater part of them detest the truth
23|71|If the truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth, and whoever therein is, had been corrupted. But We have brought them their admonition; and they turn aside from their admonition
23|72|Dost thou ask of them any maintenance for thy preaching? Since the maintenance of thy Lord is better; for He is the most bounteous provider
23|73|Thou certainly invitest them to the right way
23|74|And they who believe not in the life to come, do surely deviate from that way
23|75|If we had had compassion on them, and had taken off from them the calamity which had befallen them, they would surely have more obstinately persisted in their error, wandering in confusion
23|76|We formerly chastised them with a punishment: Yet they did not humble themselves before their Lord, neither did they make supplications unto Him
23|77|until, when We have opened upon them a door, from which a severe punishment hath issued, behold, they are driven to despair thereat
23|78|It is God who hath created in you the senses of hearing and of sight, that ye may perceive our judgments, and hearts, that ye may seriously consider them: Yet how few of you give thanks
23|79|It is He who hath produced you in the earth; and before Him shall ye be assembled
23|80|It is He who giveth life, and putteth to death; and to Him is to be attributed the vicissitude of night and day: Do ye not therefore understand
23|81|But the unbelieving Meccans say as their predecessors said
23|82|They say, when we shall be dead, and shall have become dust and bones, shall we really be raised to life
23|83|We have already been threatened with this, and our fathers also heretofore: This is nothing but fables of the ancients
23|84|Say, whose is the earth, and whoever therein is; if ye know
23|85|They will answer, God's. Say, will ye not therefore consider
23|86|Say, who is the Lord, of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the magnificent throne
23|87|They will answer, they are God's. Say, will ye not therefore fear Him
23|88|Say, in whose hand is the kingdom of all things; who protecteth whom He pleaseth, but is himself protected of none; if ye know
23|89|They will answer, in God's. Say, how therefore are ye bewitched
23|90|Yea, we have brought them the truth; and they are certainly liars in denying the same
23|91|God hath not begotten issue; neither is there any other god with Him: Otherwise every god had surely taken away that which He had created; and some of them had exalted themselves above the others. Far be that from God, which they affirm of Him
23|92|He knoweth that which is concealed, and that which is made public: Wherefore far be it from Him to have those sharers in his honour, which they attribute to Him
23|93|Say, O Lord, if thou wilt surely cause me to see the vengeance with which they have been threatened
23|94|O Lord, set me not among the ungodly people
23|95|For We are surely able to make thee to see that with which We have threatened them
23|96|Turn aside evil with that which is better: We well know the calumnies which they utter against thee
23|97|And say, O Lord, I fly unto thee for refuge, against the suggestions of the devils
23|98|And I have recourse unto Thee, O Lord, to drive them away, that they be not present with me
23|99|The gainsaying of the unbelievers ceaseth not until, when death overtaketh any of them, he saith, O Lord, suffer me to return to life
23|100|that I may do that which is right; in professing the true faith which I have neglected. By no means. Verily these are the words which he shall speak: But behind them there shall be a bar, until the day of resurrection
23|101|When therefore the trumpet shall be sounded, there shall be no relation between them which shall be regarded on that day; neither shall they ask assistance of each other
23|102|They whose balances shall be heavy with good works shall be happy
23|103|but they whose balances shall be light are those who shall lose their souls, and shall remain in hell for ever
23|104|The fire shall scorch their faces, and they shall writhe their mouths therein for anguish
23|105|and it shall be said unto them, Were not my signs rehearsed unto you; and did ye not charge them with falsehood
23|106|They shall answer, O LORD, our unhappiness prevailed over us, and we were people who sent astray
23|107|O LORD, take us forth from this fire: if we return to our former wickedness, we shall surely be unjust
23|108|God will say unto them, Be ye driven away with ignominy thereinto: and speak not unto me to deliver you
23|109|Verily there were a party of my servants, who said, O LORD, we believe: wherefore forgive us, and be merciful unto us; for thou art the best of those who show mercy
23|110|But ye received them with scoffs, so that they suffered you to forget my admonition, and ye laughed them to scorn
23|111|I have this day rewarded them, for that they suffered the injuries ye offered them with patience: verily they enjoy great felicity
23|112|God will say, What number of years have ye continued on earth
23|113|They will answer, We have continued there a day, or part of a day: but ask those who keep account
23|114|God will say, Ye have tarried but a while, if ye knew it
23|115|Did ye think that we had created you in sport, and that ye should not be brought again before us
23|116|Wherefore let GOD be exalted, the King, the Truth! There is no GOD besides him, the LORD of the honourable throne
23|117|Whoever together with the true GOD shall invoke another god, concerning whom he hath no demonstrative proof, shall surely be brought to an account for the same before his LORD. Verily the infidels shall not prosper
23|118|Say, O LORD, pardon, and show mercy; for thou art the best of those who show mercy
24|1|This sura have We sent down from heaven; and have ratified the same: And We have revealed therein evident signs, that ye may be warned
24|2|The whore, and the whoremonger, shall ye scourge with an hundred stripes. And let not compassion towards them prevent you from executing the judgment of God; if ye believe in God and the last day: And let some of the true believers be witnesses of their punishment
24|3|The whoremonger shall not marry any other than a harlot, or an idolatress. And a harlot shall no man take in marriage, except a whoremonger, or an idolater. And this kind of marriage is forbidden the true believers
24|4|But as to those who accuse women of reputation of whoredom, and produce not four witnesses of the fact, scourge them with fourscore stripes, and receive not their testimony for ever; for such are infamous prevaricators
24|5|Excepting those who shall afterwards repent, and amend; for unto such will God be gracious and merciful
24|6|They who shall accuse their wives of adultery, and shall have no witnesses thereof besides themselves; the testimony which shall be required of one of them shall be, that he swear four times by God that he speaketh the truth
24|7|And the fifth time that he imprecate the curse of God on him, if he be a liar
24|8|And it shall avert the punishment from the wife, if she swear four times by God that he is a liar
24|9|and if the fifth time she imprecate the wrath of God on her, if he speaketh the truth
24|10|If it were not for the indulgence of God towards you, and his mercy, and that God is easy to be reconciled, and wise; He would immediately discover your crimes
24|11|As to the party among you who have published the falsehood concerning Ayesha, think it not to be an evil unto you: On the contrary, it is better for you. Every man of them shall be punished according to the injustice of which he hath been guilty; and he among them who hath undertaken to aggravate the same, shall suffer a grievous punishment
24|12|Did not the faithful men, and the faithful women, when ye heard this, judge in their own minds for the best; and say, this is a manifest falsehood
24|13|Have they produced four witnesses thereof? Wherefore since they have not produced the witnesses, they are surely liars in the sight of God
24|14|Had it not been for the indulgence of God towards you, and his mercy, in this world and in that which is to come, verily a grievous punishment had been inflicted on you, for the calumny which ye have spread
24|15|When ye published that with your tongues, and spoke that with your mouths, of which ye had no knowledge; and esteemed it to be light, whereas it was a matter of importance in the sight of God
24|16|When ye heard it, did ye say, it belongeth not unto us, that we should talk of this matter: God forbid! This is a grievous calumny
24|17|God warneth you, that ye return not to the like crime for ever; if ye be true believers
24|18|And God declareth unto you his signs; for God is knowing and wise
24|19|Verily they who love that scandal be published of those who believe, shall receive a severe punishment both in this world, and in the next. God knoweth, but ye know not
24|20|Had it not been for the indulgence of God towards you, and his mercy, and that God is gracious and merciful, ye had felt his vengeance
24|21|O true believers, follow not the steps of the devil: For whosoever shall follow the steps of the devil, he will command him filthy crimes, and that which is unlawful. If it were not for the indulgence of God, and his mercy towards you, there had not been so much as one of you cleansed from his guilt for ever: But God cleanseth whom he pleaseth; for God both heareth and knoweth
24|22|Let not those among you who possess abundance of wealth, and have ability, swear that they will not give unto their kindred, and the poor, and those who have fled their country for the sake of God's true religion: But let them forgive, and act with benevolence towards them. Do ye not desire that God should pardon you? And God is gracious and merciful
24|23|Moreover they who falsely accuse modest women, who behave in a negligent manner, and are true believers, shall be cursed in this world, and in the world to come; and they shall suffer a severe punishment
24|24|One day their own tongues shall bear witness against them, and their hands, and their feet, concerning that which they have done
24|25|On that day shall God render unto them their just due; and they shall know that God is the evident truth
24|26|The wicked women should be joined to the wicked men, and the wicked men to the wicked women; but the good women should be married to the good men, and the good men to the good women. These shall be cleared from the calumnies which slanderers speak of them: They shall obtain pardon, and an honourable provision
24|27|O true believers, enter not any houses, besides your own houses, until ye have asked leave, and have saluted the family thereof: This is better for you; peradventure ye will be admonished
24|28|And if ye shall find no person in the houses, yet do not enter them, until leave be granted you: And if it be said unto you, return back; do ye return back. This will be more decent for you; and God knoweth that which ye do
24|29|It shall be no crime in you, that ye enter uninhabited houses, wherein ye may meet with a convenience. God knoweth that which ye discover, and that which ye conceal
24|30|Speak unto the true believers, that they restrain their eyes, and keep themselves from immodest actions: This will be more pure for them; for God is well acquainted with that which they do
24|31|And speak unto the believing women, that they restrain their eyes, and preserve their modesty, and discover not their ornaments, except what necessarily appeareth thereof: And let them throw their veils over their bosoms, and not shew their ornaments, unless to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands fathers, or their sons, or their husbands sons, or their brothers, or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their women, or the captives which their right-hands shall possess, or unto such men as attend them, and have no need of women, or unto children, who distinguish not the nakedness of women. And let them not make a noise with their feet, that their ornaments which they hide may thereby be discovered. And be ye all turned unto God, O true believers, that ye may be happy
24|32|Marry those who are single among you, and such as are honest of your men-servants, and your maid-servants: If they be poor, God will enrich them of his abundance; for God is bounteous and wise
24|33|And let those who find not a match, keep themselves from fornication, until God shall enrich them of his abundance. And unto such of your slaves as desire a written instrument allowing them to redeem themselves on paying a certain sum, write one, if ye know good in them; and give them of the riches of God, which He hath given you. And compel not your maid-servants to prostitute themselves, if they be willing to live chastly; that ye may seek the casual advantage of this present life: But whoever shall compel them thereto, verily God will be gracious and merciful unto such women after their compulsion
24|34|And now have We revealed unto you evident signs, and a history like unto some of the histories of those who have gone before you, and an admonition unto the pious
24|35|God is the light of heaven and earth: The similitude of his light is as a niche in a wall, wherein a lamp is placed, and the lamp inclosed in a case of glass; the glass appears as it were a shining star. It is lighted with the oil of a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east, nor of the west: It wanteth little but that the oil thereof would give light, although no fire touched it. This is light added unto light: God will direct unto his light whom He pleaseth. God propoundeth parables unto men; for God knoweth all things
24|36|In the houses which God hath permitted to be raised, and that his name be commemorated therein: Men celebrate his praise in the same morning and evening
24|37|whom neither merchandizing, nor selling diverteth from the remembering of God, and the observance of prayer, and the giving of alms; fearing the day whereon men's hearts and eyes shall be troubled
24|38|that God may recompense them according to the utmost merit of what they shall have wrought, and may add unto them of his abundance a more excellent reward; for God bestoweth on whom he pleaseth without measure
24|39|But as to the unbelievers, their works are like the vapour in a plain, which the thirsty traveller thinketh to be water, until, when he cometh thereto, he findeth it to be nothing; but he findeth God with him, and he will fully pay him his account; and God is swift in taking an account
24|40|Or, as the darkness in a deep sea, covered by waves riding on waves, above which are clouds, being additions of darkness one over the other; when one stretcheth forth his hand, he is far from seeing it. And unto whomsoever God shall not grant his light, he shall enjoy no light at all
24|41|Dost thou not perceive that all creatures both in heaven and earth praise God; and the birds also, extending their wings? Every one knoweth his prayer, and his praise: And God knoweth that which they do
24|42|Unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth; and unto God shall be the return at the last day
24|43|Dost thou not see that God gently driveth forward the clouds, and gathereth them together, and then layeth them on heaps? Thou also seest the rain, which falleth from the midst thereof; and God sendeth down from heaven as it were mountains, wherein there is hail; He striketh therewith whom He pleaseth, and turneth the same away from whom He pleaseth: The brightness of his lightning wanteth but little of taking away the sight
24|44|God shifteth the night, and the day: Verily herein is an instruction unto those who have sight
24|45|And God hath created every animal of water; one of them goeth on his belly, and another of them walketh upon two feet, and another of them walketh upon four feet: God createth that which he pleaseth; for God is almighty
24|46|Now have We sent down evident signs: And God directeth whom He pleaseth into the right way
24|47|The hypocrites say, we believe in God, and on his apostle; and we obey them: Yet a part of them turneth back, after this; but these are not really believers
24|48|And when they are summoned before God and his apostle, that He may judge between them; behold, a part of them retire
24|49|But if the right had been on their side, they would have come and submitted themselves unto Him
24|50|Is there an infirmity in their hearts? Do they doubt? Or do they fear lest God and his apostle act unjustly towards them? But themselves are the unjust doers
24|51|The saying of the true believers, when they are summoned before God and his apostle, that He may judge between them, is no other than that they say, we have heard, and do obey: And these are they who shall prosper
24|52|Whoever shall obey God and his apostle, and shall fear God, and shall be devout towards Him; these shall enjoy great felicity
24|53|They swear by God, with a most solemn oath, that if thou commandest them, they will go forth from their houses and possessions. Say, swear not to a falsehood: Obedience is more requisite: And God is well acquainted with that which ye do
24|54|Say, obey God, and obey the apostle: But if ye turn back, verily it is expected of him that he perform his duty, and of you that ye perform your duty; and if ye obey him, ye shall be directed: But the duty of our apostle is only public preaching
24|55|God promiseth unto such of you as believe, and do good works, that he will cause them to succeed the unbelievers in the earth, as he caused those who were before you to succeed the infidels of their time; and that he will establish for them their religion which pleaseth them, and will change their fear into security. They shall worship Me; and shall not associate any other with Me. But whoever shall disbelieve after this; they will be the wicked doers
24|56|Observe prayer, and give alms, and obey the apostle; that ye may obtain mercy
24|57|Think not that the unbelievers shall frustrate the designs of God on earth: And their abode hereafter shall be hell fire; a miserable journey shall it be thither
24|58|O true believers, let your slaves and those among you who shall not have attained the age of puberty, ask leave of you, before they come into your presence, three times in the day; namely, before the morning prayer, and when ye lay aside your garments at noon, and after the evening prayer. These are the three times for you to be private: It shall be no crime in you, or in them, if they go into you without asking permission after these times, while ye are in frequent attendance, the one of you on the other. Thus God declareth his signs unto you; for God is knowing and wise
24|59|And when your children attain the age of puberty, let them ask leave to come into your presence at all times, in the same manner as those who have attained that age before them, ask leave. Thus God declareth his signs unto you; and God is knowing and wise
24|60|As to such women as are past child-bearing, who hope not to marry again, because of their advanced age; it shall be no crime in them, if they lay aside their outer garments, not shewing their ornaments; but if they abstain from this, it will be better for them. God both heareth and knoweth
24|61|It shall be no crime in the blind, nor shall it be any crime in the lame, neither shall it be any crime in the sick, or in your selves, that ye eat in your houses, or in the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or in the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your uncles on the father's side, or the houses of your aunts on the father's side, or the houses of your uncles on the mother's side, or the houses of your aunts on the mother's side, or in those houses the keys whereof ye have in your possession, or in the house of your friend. It shall not be any crime in you whether ye eat together, or separately. And when ye enter any houses, salute one another on the part of God, with a blessed and a welcome salutation. Thus God declareth his signs unto you, that ye may understand
24|62|Verily they only are true believers, who believe in God and his apostle, and when they are assembled with him on any affair, depart not, until they have obtained leave of him. Verily they who ask leave of thee, are those who believe in God and his apostle. When therefore they ask leave of thee to depart, on account of any business of their own, grant leave unto such of them as thou shalt think fit, and ask pardon for them of God; for God is gracious and merciful
24|63|Let not the calling of the apostle be esteemed among you, as your calling the one to the other. God knoweth such of you as privately withdraw themselves from the assembly, taking shelter behind one another. But let those who withstand his command, take heed; lest some calamity befall them in this world, or a grievous punishment be inflicted on them in the life to come
24|64|Doth not whatever is in heaven and on earth belong unto God? He well knoweth what ye are about: And on a certain day they shall be assembled before Him; and He shall declare unto them that which they have done; for God knoweth all things
25|1|Blessed be he who hath revealed the Forkan unto his servant, that he may be a preacher unto all creatures
25|2|Unto whom belongeth the kingdom of heaven and of earth: Who hath begotten no issue; and hath no partner in his kingdom: Who hath created all things; and disposed the same according to his determinate will
25|3|Yet have they taken other gods besides Him; which have created nothing, but are themselves created: And are able neither to avert evil from, nor to procure good unto themselves; and have not the power of death, or of life, or of raising the dead
25|4|And the unbelievers say, this Koran is no other than a forgery which he hath contrived; and other people have assisted him therein: But they utter an unjust thing, and a falsehood
25|5|They also say, these are fables of the ancients, which he hath caused to be written down; and they are dictated unto him morning and evening
25|6|Say, He hath revealed it, who knoweth the secrets in heaven and earth: Verily He is gracious and merciful
25|7|And they say, what kind of apostle is this? He eateth food, and walketh in the streets, as we do: Unless an angel be sent down unto him, and become a fellow preacher with him
25|8|or unless a treasure be cast down unto him; or he have a garden, of the fruit whereof he may eat; we will not believe. The ungodly also say, ye follow no other than a man who is distracted
25|9|Behold, what they liken thee unto. But they are deceived; neither can they find a just occasion to reproach thee
25|10|Blessed be He, who, if He pleaseth, will make for thee a better provision than this which they speak of, namely, gardens through which rivers flow: And He will provide thee palaces
25|11|But they reject the belief of the hour of judgment, as a falsehood: And We have prepared for him, who shall reject the belief of that hour, burning fire
25|12|when it shall see them from a distant place, they shall hear it furiously raging, and roaring
25|13|And when they shall be cast bound together into a strait place thereof, they shall there call for death
25|14|But it shall be answered them, call not this day for one death, but call for many deaths
25|15|Say, is this better, or a garden of eternal duration, which is promised unto the pious? It shall be given unto them for a reward, and a retreat
25|16|Therein shall they have whatever they please; continuing in the same for ever. This is a promise to be demanded at the hands of thy Lord
25|17|On a certain day He shall assemble them, and whatever they worship, besides God; and shall say unto the worshipped, Did ye seduce these my servants; or did they wander of themselves from the right way
25|18|They shall answer, God forbid! It was not fitting for us, that we should take any protectors besides Thee: But Thou didst permit them and their fathers to enjoy abundance; so that they forgot thy admonition, and became lost people
25|19|And God shall say unto their worshippers, now have these convinced you of falsehood, in that which ye say: They can neither avert your punishment, nor give you any assistance. And whoever of you shall be guilty of injustice, him will We cause to taste a grievous torment
25|20|We have sent no messengers before thee, but they ate food, and walked through the streets: And We make some of you an occasion of trial unto others. Will ye persevere with patience? since your Lord regardeth your perseverance
25|21|They who hope not to meet Us at the resurrection say, unless the angels be sent down unto us, or we see our Lord Himself, we will not believe. Verily they behave themselves arrogantly; and have transgressed with an enormous transgression
25|22|The day whereon they shall see the angels, there shall be no glad tidings on that day for the wicked; and they shall say, be this removed far from us
25|23|And We will come unto the work which they shall have wrought, and We will make it as dust scattered abroad
25|24|On that day shall they who are destined to paradise be more happy in an abode, and have a preferable place of repose at noon
25|25|On that day the heaven shall be cloven in sunder by the clouds, and the angels shall be sent down, descending visibly therein
25|26|On that day the kingdom shall of right belong wholly unto the Merciful; and that day shall be grievous for the unbelievers
25|27|On that day, the unjust person shall bite his hands for anguish and despair, and shall say, O that I had taken the way of truth with the apostle
25|28|Alas for me! O that I had not taken such a one for my friend
25|29|He seduced me from the admonition of God, after it had come unto me: For the devil is the betrayer of man
25|30|And the apostle shall say, O Lord, verily my people esteemed this Koran to be a vain composition
25|31|In like manner did We ordain unto every prophet an enemy from among the wicked: But thy Lord is a sufficient director, and defender
25|32|The unbelievers say, unless the Koran be sent down unto him entire at once, we will not believe. But in this manner have We revealed it, that We might confirm thy heart thereby, and We have dictated it gradually, by distinct parcels
25|33|They shall not come unto thee with any strange question; but We will bring thee the truth in answer, and a most excellent interpretation
25|34|They who shall be dragged on their faces into hell, shall be in the worst condition, and shall stray most widely from the way of salvation
25|35|We heretofore delivered unto Moses the book of the law; and We appointed him Aaron his brother for a counsellor
25|36|And We said unto them, go ye to the people who charge our signs with falsehood. And We destroyed them with a signal destruction
25|37|And remember the people of Noah, when they accused our apostles of imposture: We drowned them, and made them a sign unto mankind. And We have prepared for the unjust a painful torment
25|38|Remember also Ad, and Thamud, and those who dwelt at al Rass; and many other generations, within this period
25|39|Unto each of them did We propound examples for their admonition; and each of them did We destroy with an utter destruction
25|40|The Koreish have passed frequently near the city which was rained on by a fatal rain: Have they not seen where it once stood? Yet have they not dreaded the resurrection
25|41|When they see thee, they will receive thee only with scoffing, saying, is this he, whom God hath sent as his apostle
25|42|Verily he had almost drawn us aside from the worship of our gods; if we had not firmly persevered in our devotion towards them. But they shall know hereafter, when they shall see the punishment prepared for them, who hath strayed more widely from the right path
25|43|What thinkest thou? He who taketh his lust for his god; canst thou be his guardian
25|44|Dost thou imagine that the greater part of them hear, or understand? They are no other than like the brute cattle; yea, they stray more widely from the true path
25|45|Dost thou not consider the works of thy Lord, how He stretcheth forth the shadow before sun-rise? If he had pleased, he would have made it immovable for ever. Then We cause the sun to rise, and to shew the same
25|46|and afterwards We contract it by an easy and gradual contraction
25|47|It is He who hath ordained the night to cover you as a garment; and sleep to give you rest; and hath ordained the day for waking
25|48|It is He who sendeth the winds, driving abroad the pregnant clouds, as the forerunners of his mercy: And We send down pure water from heaven
25|49|that We may thereby revive a dead country, and give to drink thereof unto what We have created, both of cattle and men, in great numbers
25|50|and We distribute the same among them at various times, that they may consider: But the greater part of men refuse to consider, only out of ingratitude
25|51|If We had pleased, We had sent a preacher unto every city
25|52|Wherefore do not thou obey the unbelievers; but oppose them herewith, with a strong opposition
25|53|It is He who hath let loose the two seas; this fresh and sweet, and that salt and bitter: And hath placed between them a bar, and a bound which cannot be passed
25|54|It is He who hath created man of water; and hath made him to bear the double relation of consanguinity and affinity; for thy Lord is powerful
25|55|They worship, besides God, that which can neither profit them nor hurt them: And the unbeliever is an assistant of the devil against his Lord
25|56|We have sent thee to be no other than a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats
25|57|Say, I ask not of you any reward for this my preaching; besides the conversion of him who shall desire to take the way unto his Lord
25|58|And do thou trust in Him who liveth, and dieth not; and celebrate his praise: -- He is sufficiently acquainted with the faults of his servants
25|59|Who hath created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, in six days; and then ascended his throne; the Merciful. Ask now the knowing concerning Him
25|60|When it is said unto the unbelievers, adore the Merciful; they reply, and who is the Merciful? Shall we adore that which thou commandest us? And this precept causeth them to fly the faster from the faith
25|61|Blessed be He who hath placed the twelve signs in the heavens; and hath placed therein a lamp by day, and the moon which shineth by night
25|62|It is He who hath ordained the night and the day to succeed each other, for the observation of him who will consider, or desireth to shew his gratitude
25|63|The servants of the Merciful are those who walk meekly on the earth, and, when the ignorant speak unto them, answer, peace
25|64|And who pass the night adoring their Lord, and standing up to pray unto Him
25|65|and who say, O Lord, avert from us the torment of hell, for the torment thereof is perpetual
25|66|verily the same is a miserable abode, and a wretched station
25|67|And who, when they bestow, are neither profuse, nor niggardly; but observe a just medium between these
25|68|and who invoke not another god together with the true God; neither slay the soul, which God hath forbidden to be slain, unless for a just cause
25|69|And who are not guilty of fornication. His punishment shall be doubled unto him on the day of resurrection; and he shall remain therein, covered with ignominy, for ever
25|70|Except him who shall repent, and believe, and shall work a righteous work; unto them will God change their former evils into good; for God is ready to forgive, and merciful
25|71|And whoever repenteth, and doth that which is right; verily he turneth unto God with an acceptable conversion
25|72|And they who do not bear false witness; and when they pass by vain discourse, pass by the same with decency
25|73|And who, when they are admonished by the signs of their Lord, fall not down as if they were deaf and blind, but stand up and are attentive thereto
25|74|And who say, O Lord, grant us of our wives and our offspring such as may be the satisfaction of our eyes; and make us patterns unto those who fear thee
25|75|These shall be rewarded with the highest apartments in paradise, because they have persevered with constancy; and they shall meet therein with greeting and salutation
25|76|they shall remain in the same for ever: It shall be an excellent abode, and a delightful station
25|77|Say, my Lord is not solicitous on your account, if ye do not invoke Him: Ye have already charged his apostle with imposture; but hereafter shall there be a lasting punishment inflicted on you
26|1|M
26|2|These are the signs of the perspicuous book
26|3|Peradventure thou afflictest thy self unto death, lest the Meccans become not true believers
26|4|If We pleased, We could send down unto them a convincing sign from heaven, unto which their necks would humbly submit
26|5|But where cometh unto them no admonition from the Merciful, being newly revealed as occasions require, but they turn aside from the same
26|6|and they have charged it with falsehood: But a message shall come unto them, which they shall not laugh to scorn
26|7|Do they not behold the earth, how many vegetables We cause to spring up therein, of every noble species
26|8|Verily herein is a sign: But the greater part of them do not believe
26|9|Verily thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful God
26|10|Remember when thy Lord called Moses, saying, go to the unjust people
26|11|the people of Pharaoh; will they not dread Me
26|12|Moses answered, O Lord, verily I fear lest they accuse me of falsehood
26|13|and lest my breast become straitened, and my tongue be not ready in speaking: Send therefore unto Aaron, to be my assistant
26|14|Also they have a crime to object against me; and I fear they will put me to death
26|15|God said, they shall by no means put thee to death: Wherefore go ye with our signs; for We will be with you, and will hear what passes between you and them
26|16|Go ye therefore unto Pharaoh, and say, verily we are the apostle of the Lord of all creatures
26|17|Send away with us the children of Israel
26|18|And when they had delivered their message, Pharaoh answered, have we not brought thee up among us, when a child; and hast thou not dwelt among us for several years of thy life
26|19|Yet hast thou done thy deed which thou hast done: And thou art an ungrateful person
26|20|Moses replied, I did it indeed, and I was one of those who erred
26|21|wherefore I fled from you, because I feared you: But my Lord hath bestowed on me wisdom, and hath appointed me one of his apostles
26|22|And this is the favour which thou hast bestowed on me, that thou hast enslaved the children of Israel
26|23|Pharaoh said, and who is the Lord of all creatures
26|24|Moses answered, the Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them: If ye are men of sagacity
26|25|Pharaoh said unto those who were about him, do ye not hear
26|26|Moses said, your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers
26|27|Pharaoh said unto those who were present, your apostle, who is sent unto you, is certainly distracted
26|28|Moses said, the Lord of the east, and of the west, and of whatever is between them; if ye are men of understanding
26|29|Pharaoh said unto him, verily if thou take any god besides me, I will make thee one of those who are imprisoned
26|30|Moses answered, what, although I come unto you with a convincing miracle
26|31|Pharaoh replied, produce it therefore, if thou speakest truth
26|32|And he cast down his rod, and behold, it became a visible serpent
26|33|And he drew forth his hand out of his bosom; and behold, it appeared, white unto the spectators
26|34|Pharahoh said unto the princes who were about him, verily this man is a skilful magician
26|35|He seeketh to dispossess you of your land by his sorcery; what therefore do ye direct
26|36|They answered, delay him, and his brother by good words for a time; and send through the cities men to assemble
26|37|and bring unto thee every skilful magician
26|38|So the magicians were assembled at an appointed time, on a solemn day
26|39|And it was said unto the people, are ye assembled together
26|40|Perhaps we may follow the magicians, if they do get the victory
26|41|And when the magicians were come, they said unto Pharaoh, shall we certainly receive a reward, if we do get the victory
26|42|He answered, yea; and ye shall surely be of those who approach my person
26|43|Moses said unto them, cast down what ye are about to cast down
26|44|Wherefore they cast down their ropes and their rods, and said, by the might of Pharaoh, verily we shall be the conquerors
26|45|And Moses cast down his rod, and behold, it swallowed up that which they had caused falsely to appear changed into serpents
26|46|Whereupon the magicians prostrated themselves, worshipping
26|47|and said, we believe in the Lord of all creatures
26|48|the Lord of Moses and of Aaron
26|49|Pharaoh said unto them, have ye believed on him, before I have given you permission? Verily he is your chief, who hath taught you magic: But hereafter ye shall surely know my power. I will cut off your hands and your feet, on the opposite sides, and I will crucify you all
26|50|They answered, it will be no harm unto us; for we shall return unto our Lord
26|51|We hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, since we are the first who have believed
26|52|And we spake by revelation unto Moses, saying, march forth with my servants by night; for ye will be pursued
26|53|And Pharaoh sent officers through the cities to assemble forces, saying
26|54|verily these are a small company
26|55|and they are enraged against us
26|56|But we are a multitude well provided
26|57|So we caused them to quit their gardens, and fountains
26|58|and treasures, and fair dwellings
26|59|Thus did We do; and We made the children of Israel to inherit the same
26|60|And they pursued them at sun-rise
26|61|And when the two armies were come in sight of each other, the companions of Moses said, we shall surely be overtaken
26|62|Moses answered, by no means: For my Lord is with me, Who will surely direct me
26|63|And We commanded Moses by revelation, saying, smite the sea with thy rod. And when he had smitten it, it became divided into twelve parts, between which were as many paths, and every part was like a vast mountain
26|64|And We drew thither the others
26|65|and We delivered Moses and all those who were with him
26|66|Then We drowned the others
26|67|Verily herein was a sign; but the greater part of them did not believe
26|68|Verily thy Lord is the mighty, and the merciful
26|69|And rehearse unto them the story of Abraham
26|70|When he said unto his father, and his people, what do ye worship
26|71|They answered, we worship idols; and we constantly serve them all the day long
26|72|Abraham said, do they hear you, when ye invoke them
26|73|Or do they either profit you, or hurt you
26|74|They answered, but we found our fathers do the same
26|75|He said, what think ye? The gods which ye worship
26|76|and your forefathers worshipped
26|77|are my enemy: Except only the Lord of all creatures
26|78|who hath created me, and directeth me
26|79|and who giveth me to eat, and to drink
26|80|and when I am sick, healeth me
26|81|and Who will cause me to die, and will afterwards restore me to life
26|82|and Who, I hope, will forgive my sins on the day of judgment
26|83|O Lord, grant me wisdom; and join me with the righteous
26|84|And grant that I may be spoken of with honour among the latest posterity
26|85|and make me an heir of the garden of delight
26|86|And forgive my father, for that he hath been one of those who go astray
26|87|And cover me not with shame on the day of resurrection
26|88|on the day in which neither riches nor children shall avail
26|89|unless unto him who shall come unto God with a sincere heart
26|90|When paradise shall be brought near to the view of the pious
26|91|and hell shall appear plainly to those who shall have erred
26|92|and it shall be said unto them, where are your deities which ye served
26|93|besides God? Will they deliver you from punishment, or will they deliver themselves
26|94|And they shall be cast into the same, both they, and those who have been seduced to their worship
26|95|and all the host of Eblis
26|96|The seduced shall dispute therein with their false gods, saying
26|97|by God, we were in a manifest error
26|98|when we equalled you with the Lord of all creatures
26|99|And none seduced us but the wicked
26|100|We have now no intercessors
26|101|nor any friend who careth for us
26|102|If we were allowed to return once more into the world, we would certainly become true believers
26|103|Verily herein was a sign: But the greater part of them believed not
26|104|Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
26|105|The people of Noah accused God's messengers of imposture
26|106|When their brother Noah said unto them, will ye not fear God
26|107|Verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
26|108|wherefore fear God, and obey me
26|109|I ask no reward of you for my preaching unto you; I expect my reward from no other than the Lord of all creatures
26|110|Wherefore fear God, and obey me
26|111|They answered, shall we believe on thee, when only the most abject persons have followed thee
26|112|Noah said, I have no knowledge of that which they did
26|113|it appertaineth unto my Lord alone to bring them to account, if ye understand
26|114|wherefore I will not drive away the believers
26|115|I am no more than a public preacher
26|116|They replied, assuredly, unless thou desist, O Noah, thou shalt be stoned
26|117|He said, O Lord, verily my people take me for a liar
26|118|Wherefore judge publicly between me and them; and deliver me and the true believers who are with me
26|119|Wherefore We delivered him, and those who were with him, in the ark filled with men and animals
26|120|and afterwards We drowned the rest
26|121|Verily herein was a sign: But the greater part of them believed not
26|122|Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
26|123|The tribe of Ad charged God's messengers with falsehood
26|124|When their brother Hud said unto them, will ye not fear God
26|125|Verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
26|126|wherefore fear God, and obey me
26|127|I demand not of you any reward for my preaching unto you: I expect my reward from no other than the Lord of all creatures
26|128|Do ye build a land-mark on every high place, to divert yourselves
26|129|And do ye erect maginificent works, hoping that ye may continue in their possession for ever
26|130|And when ye exercise your power, do ye exercise it with cruelty and rigour
26|131|Fear God, by leaving these things; and obey Me
26|132|And fear Him who hath bestowed on you that which ye know
26|133|He hath bestowed on you cattle, and children
26|134|and gardens, and springs of water
26|135|Verily I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day
26|136|They answered, it is equal unto us whether thou admonish us, or dost not admonish us
26|137|This which thou preachest is only a device of the ancients
26|138|neither shall we be punished for what we have done
26|139|And they accused him of imposture: Wherefore We destroyed them. Verily herein was a sign: But the greater part of them believed not
26|140|Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
26|141|The tribe of Thamud also charged the messengers of God with falsehood
26|142|When their brother Saleh said unto them, will ye not fear God
26|143|Verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
26|144|Wherefore fear God, and obey me
26|145|I demand no reward of you for my preaching unto you; I expect my reward from no other than the Lord of all creatures
26|146|Shall ye be left for ever secure in the possession of the things which are here
26|147|among gardens, and fountains
26|148|and corn, and palm-trees, whose branches sheathe their flowers
26|149|And will ye continue to cut habitations for your selves out of the mountains, behaving with insolence
26|150|Fear God, and obey me
26|151|and obey not the command of the transgressors
26|152|who act corruptly in the earth, and reform not the same
26|153|They answered, verily thou art distracted
26|154|Thou art no other than a man like unto us: Produce now some sign, if thou speakest truth
26|155|Saleh said, this she-camel shall be a sign unto you: She shall have her portion of water, and ye shall have your portion of water alternately, on a several day appointed for you
26|156|and do her no hurt, lest the punishment of a terrible day be inflicted on you
26|157|But they slew her; and were made to repent of their impiety
26|158|For the punishment which had been threatened overtook them. Verily herein was a sign; but the greater part of them did not believe
26|159|Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
26|160|The people of Lot likewise accused God's messengers of imposture
26|161|When their brother Lot said unto them, will ye not fear God
26|162|Verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
26|163|Wherefore fear God, and obey me
26|164|I demand no reward of you for my preaching: I expect my reward from no other than the Lord of all creatures
26|165|Do ye approach unto the males among mankind
26|166|and leave your wives which your Lord hath created for you? Surely ye are people who transgress
26|167|They answered, unless thou desist, O Lot, thou shalt certainly be expelled our city
26|168|He said, verily I am one of those who abhor your doings
26|169|O Lord, deliver me, and my family, from that which they act
26|170|Wherefore We delivered him, and all his family
26|171|except an old woman, his wife, who perished among those who remained behind
26|172|Then We destroyed the rest
26|173|and We rained on them a shower of stones; and terrible was the shower which fell on those who had been warned in vain
26|174|Verily herein was a sign; but the greater part of them did not believe
26|175|Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
26|176|The inhabitants of the wood also accused God's messengers of imposture
26|177|When Shoaib said unto them, will ye not fear God
26|178|Verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
26|179|Wherefore fear God, and obey me
26|180|I ask no reward of you for my preaching: I expect my reward from no other than the Lord of all creatures
26|181|Give just measure, and be not defrauders
26|182|and weigh with an equal balance
26|183|and diminish not unto men ought of their matters; neither commit violence in the earth, acting corruptly
26|184|And fear him who hath created you, and also the former generations
26|185|They answered, certainly thou art distracted
26|186|Thou art no more than a man, like unto us; and we do surely esteem thee to be a liar
26|187|Cause now a part of the heaven to fall upon us, if thou speakest truth
26|188|Shoaib said, my Lord best knoweth that which ye do
26|189|And they charged him with falsehood: Wherefore the punishment of the day of the shadowing cloud overtook them; and this was the punishment of a grievous day
26|190|Verily herein was a sign; but the greater part of them did not believe
26|191|Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
26|192|This book is certainly a revelation from the Lord of all creatures
26|193|which the faithful spirit hath caused to descend
26|194|upon thy heart, that thou mightest be a preacher to thy prople
26|195|in the perspicuous Arabic tongue
26|196|And it is born witness to in the scriptures of former ages
26|197|Was it not a sign unto them, that the wise men among the children of Israel knew it
26|198|Had We revealed it unto any of the foreigners
26|199|and he had read the same unto them, yet they would not have believed therein
26|200|Thus have We caused obstinate infidelity to enter the hearts of the wicked
26|201|They shall not believe therein, until they see a painful punishment
26|202|It shall come suddenly upon them, and they shall not foresee it
26|203|And they shall say, shall we be respited
26|204|Do they therefore desire our punishment to be hastened
26|205|What thinkest thou? If We suffer them to enjoy the advantage of this life for several years
26|206|and afterwards that with which they are threatened come upon them
26|207|what will that which they have enjoyed profit them
26|208|We have destroyed no city, but preachers were first sent unto it
26|209|to admonish the inhabitants thereof; neither did We treat them unjustly
26|210|The devils did not descend with the Koran, as the infidels give out
26|211|It is not for their purpose, neither are they able to produce such a book
26|212|for they are far removed from hearing the discourse of the angels in heaven
26|213|Invoke no other god with the true God, lest thou become one of those who are doomed to punishment
26|214|And admonish thy more near relations
26|215|And behave thy self with meekness towards the true believers who follow thee
26|216|And if they be disobedient unto thee, say, verily I am clear of that which ye do
26|217|And trust in the most mighty, the merciful God
26|218|who seeth thee when thou risest up
26|219|and thy behaviour among those who worship
26|220|for He both heareth and knoweth
26|221|Shall I declare unto you upon whom the devils descend
26|222|They descend upon every lying and wiched person
26|223|They learn what is heard; but the greater part of them are liars
26|224|And those who err follow the steps of the poets
26|225|Dost thou not see that they rove as bereft of their senses through every valley
26|226|and that they say that which they do not
26|227|Except those who believe, and do good works, and remember God frequently; and who defend themselves, after they have been unjustly treated. And they who act unjustly shall know hereafter, with what treatment they shall be treated
27|1|These are the signs of the Koran, and of the perspicuous book
27|2|A direction, and good tidings unto the true believers
27|3|who regularly perform their prayer, and give alms, and firmly believe in the life to come
27|4|As to those who believe not in the life to come, We have prepared their works for them; and they shall be struck with astonishment at their disappointment, when they shall be raised again
27|5|These are they whom an evil punishment awaiteth in this life; and in that which is to come they shall be the greatest losers
27|6|Thou hast certainly received the Koran from the presence of a wise, a knowing God
27|7|Remember when Moses said unto his family, verily I perceive fire: I will bring you tidings thereof, or I will bring you a lighted brand, that ye may be warmed
27|8|And when he was come near unto it, a voice cried unto him, saying, blessed be He who is in the fire, and whoever is about it; and praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
27|9|O Moses, verily I am God, the mighty, the wise
27|10|Cast down now thy rod. And when he saw it, that it moved, as though it had been a serpent, he retreated and fled, and returned not. And God said, O Moses, fear not; for my messengers are not disturbed with fear in my sight
27|11|Except he who shall have done amiss, and shall have afterwards substituted good in lieu of evil; for I am gracious and merciful
27|12|Moreover put thy hand into thy bosom; it shall come forth white, without hurt: This shall be one among the nine signs unto Pharaoh and his people; for they are a wicked people
27|13|And when our visible signs had come unto them, they said, this is manifest sorcery
27|14|And they denied them, although their souls certainly knew them to be from God, out of iniquity and pride: But behold what was the end of the corrupt doers
27|15|We heretofore bestowed knowledge on David and Solomon; and they said, praise be unto God, who hath made us more excellent than many of his faithful servants
27|16|And Solomon was David's heir; and he said, O men, we have been taught the speech of birds, and have had all things bestowed on us; this is manifest excellence
27|17|And his armies were gathered together unto Solomon, consisting of genii, and men, and birds; and they were led in distinct bands
27|18|until they came unto the valley of ants. And an ant, seeing the hosts approaching, said, O ants, enter ye into your habitations, lest Solomon and his army tread you under foot, and perceive it not
27|19|And Solomon smiled, laughing at her words, and said, O Lord, excite me that I may be thankful for thy favour, wherewith thou hast favoured me, and my parents; and that I may do that which is right, and well-pleasing unto thee: And introduce me, through thy mercy, into paradise, among thy servants the righteous
27|20|And he viewed the birds, and said, what is the reason that I see not the lapwing? Is she absent
27|21|Verily I will chastise her with a severe chastisement, or I will put her to death; unless she bring me a just excuse
27|22|And she tarried not long before she presented herself unto Solomon, and said, I have viewed a country which thou hast not viewed; and I come unto thee from Saba, with a certain piece of news
27|23|I found a woman to reign over them, who is provided with every thing requisite for a prince, and hath a magnificent throne
27|24|I found her and her people to worship the sun, besides God: And Satan hath prepared their works for them, and hath turned them aside from the way of truth, -- wherefore they are not rightly directed
27|25|lest they should worship God, who bringeth to light that which is hidden in heaven and earth, and knoweth whatever they conceal, and whatever they discover
27|26|God! There is no God but He; the Lord of the magnificent throne
27|27|Solomon said, we shall see whether thou hast spoken the truth, or whether thou art a liar
27|28|Go with this my letter, and cast it down unto them; then turn aside from them, and wait to know what answer they will return
27|29|And when the queen of Saba had received the letter, she said, O nobles, verily an honourable letter hath been delivered unto me
27|30|it is from Solomon, and this is the tenor thereof: In the name of the most merciful God
27|31|rise not up against me: But come, and surrender yourselves unto me
27|32|She said, O nobles, advise me in my business: I will not resolve on any thing, until ye be witnesses and approve thereof
27|33|The nobles answered, we are indued with strength, and are indued with great prowess in war; but the command appertaineth unto thee: See therefore what thou wilt command
27|34|She said, verily kings, when they enter a city by force, waste the same, and abase the most powerful of the inhabitants hereof: And so will these do with us
27|35|But I will send gifts unto them; and will wait for what farther information those who shall be sent, shall bring back
27|36|And when the queen's ambassador came unto Solomon, that prince said, will ye present me with riches? Verily that which God hath given me, is better than what he hath given you: But ye do glory in your gifts
27|37|Return unto the people of Saba. We will surely come unto them with forces, which they shall not be able to withstand; and we will drive them out from their city, humbled; and they shall become contemptible
27|38|And Solomon said, O nobles, which of you will bring unto me her throne, before they come and surrender themselves unto me
27|39|A terrible genius answered, I will bring it unto thee, before thou arise from thy place: For I am able to perform it, and may be trusted
27|40|And one with whom was the knowledge of the scriptures said, I will bring it unto thee, in the twinkling of an eye. And when Solomon saw the throne placed before him, he said, this is a favour of my Lord, that he may make trial of me, whether I will be grateful, or whether I will be ungrateful: And he who is grateful, is grateful to his own advantage, but if any shall be ungrateful, verily my Lord is self-sufficient and munificent
27|41|And Solomon said unto his servants, alter her throne, that she may not know it, to the end we may see whether she be rightly directed, or whether she be one of those who are not rightly directed
27|42|And when she was come unto Solomon, it was said unto her, is thy throne like this? She answered, as though it were the same. And we have had knowledge bestowed on us before this, and have been resigned unto God
27|43|But that which she worshipped, besides God, had turned her aside from the truth; for she was of an unbelieving people
27|44|It was said unto her, enter the palace. And when she saw it, she imagined it to be a great water; and she discovered her legs, by lifting up her robe to pass through it. Whereupon Solomon said unto her, verily this is a palace evenly floored with glass. Then said the queen, O Lord, verily I have dealt unjustly with my own soul; and I resign my self, together with Solomon, unto God, the Lord of all creatures
27|45|Also We heretofore sent unto the tribe of Thamud their brother Saleh; who said unto them, Serve ye God. And behold, they were divided into two parties, who disputed among themselves
27|46|Saleh said, O my people, why do ye hasten evil rather than good? Unless ye ask pardon of God, that ye may obtain mercy, ye are lost
27|47|They answered, we presage evil from thee, and from those who are with thee. Saleh replied, the evil which ye presage is with God: But ye are a people who are proved by a vicissitude of prosperity and adversity
27|48|And there were nine men in the city, who acted corruptly in the earth, and behaved not with integrity
27|49|And they said unto one another, swear ye reciprocally by God, that we will fall upon Saleh and his family by night: And afterwards we will say unto him who hath right to avenge his blood, we were not so much as present at the destruction of his family; and we certainly speak the truth
27|50|And they devised a plot against him: But We devised a plot against them; and they perceived it not
27|51|And see what was the issue of their plot: We utterly destroyed them and their whole people
27|52|and these their habitations remain empty, because of the injustice which they committed. Verily herein is a sign, unto people who understand
27|53|And We delivered those who believed, and feared God
27|54|And remember Lot; when he said unto his people, do ye commit a wickedness, though ye see the hainousness thereof
27|55|Do ye approach lustfully unto men, leaving the women? Ye are surely an ignorant people
27|56|But the answer of his people was no other than that they said, cast the family of Lot out of your city: For they are men who preserve themselves pure from the crimes of which ye are guilty
27|57|Wherefore We delivered him and his family, except his wife, whom We decreed to be one of those who remained behind to be destroyed
27|58|And We rained on them a shower of stones: And dreadful was the shower which fell on those who had been warned in vain
27|59|Say, praise be unto God; and peace be upon his servants whom He hath chosen! Is God more worthy, or the false gods which they associate with him
27|60|Is not He to be preferred, who hath created the heavens and the earth, and sendeth down rain for you from heaven, whereby We cause delicious groves to spring up? It is not in your power to cause the trees thereof to shoot forth. Is there any other god partner with the true God? Verily these are a people who deviate from the truth
27|61|Is not He more worthy to be adored, who hath established the earth, and hath caused rivers to flow through the midst thereof, and placed thereon immovable mountains, and set a bar between the two seas? Is there any other god equal with the true God? Yet the greater part of them know it not
27|62|Is not He more worthy who heareth the afflicted, when he calleth upon Him, and taketh off the evil which distressed him; and who hath made you the successors of your forefathers in the earth? Is there any other god who can be equalled with the true God? How few consider these things
27|63|Is not He more worthy Who directeth you in the dark paths of the land and of the sea; and Who sendeth the winds driving abroad the clouds, as the forerunners of this mercy? Is there any other god who can be equalled with the true God? Far be God from having those partners in his power, which ye associate with Him
27|64|Is not He more worthy, Who produceth a creature, and after it hath been dead restoreth it to life; and Who giveth you food from heaven and earth? Is there any other god with the true God, who doth this? Say, produce your proof thereof, if ye speak truth
27|65|Say, none either in heaven or earth knoweth that which is hidden, besides God: Neither do they understand when they shall be raised
27|66|However their knowledge attaineth some notion of the life to come: Yet they are in an uncertainty concerning the same; yea, they are blind as to the real curcumstances thereof
27|67|And the unblievers say, when we and our fathers shall have been reduced to dust, shall we be taken forth from the grave
27|68|Verily we have been threatened with this, both we and our fathers, heretofore. This is no other than fables of the ancients
27|69|Say unto them, pass through the earth, and see what hath been the end of the wicked
27|70|And be not thou grieved for them; neither be thou in any concern on account of the plots which they are contriving against thee
27|71|And they say, when will this threat be accomplished, if ye speak true
27|72|Answer, peradventure some part of that punishment, which ye desire to be hastened, may follow close behind you
27|73|Verily thy Lord is endued with indulgence towards mankind; but the greater part of them are not thankful
27|74|Verily thy Lord knoweth what their breasts conceal, and what they discover
27|75|And there is nothing hidden in heaven or on earth, but it is written in a clear book
27|76|Verily this Koran declareth unto the children of Israel most of those points concerning which they disagree
27|77|And it is certainly a direction, and a mercy unto the true believers
27|78|Thy Lord will decide the controversy between them, by his definitive sentence: And he is the mighty, the wise
27|79|Therefore put thy trust in God; for thou art in the manifest truth
27|80|Verily thou shalt not make the dead to hear, neither shalt thou make the deaf to hear thy call to the true faith, when they retire and turn their backs
27|81|Neither shalt thou direct the blind to extricate themselves out of their error. Thou shalt make none to hear thee, except him who shall believe in our signs: And they are wholly resigned unto Us
27|82|When the sentence shall be ready to fall upon them, We will cause a beast to come forth unto them from out of the earth, which shall speak unto them: Verily men do not firmly believe in our signs
27|83|On the day of resurrection We will assemble, out of every nation, a company of those who shall have charged our signs with falsehood; and they shall be prevented from mixing together
27|84|until they shall arrive at the place of judgment. And God shall say unto them, have ye charged my signs with falsehood, although ye comprehended them not with your knowledge? Or what is it that ye were doing
27|85|And the sentence of damnation shall fall on them, for that they have acted unjustly: And they shall not speak in their own excuse
27|86|Do they not see that We have ordained the night, that they may rest therein, and the day giving open light? Verily herein are signs unto people who believe
27|87|On that day the trumpet shall be sounded; and whoever are in heaven and on earth shall be struck with terror, except those whom God shall please to exempt therefrom: And all shall come before him, in humble guise
27|88|And thou shalt see the mountains, and shalt think them firmly fixed; but they shall pass away, even as the clouds pass away. This will be the work of God, who hath rightly disposed all things: And He is well acquainted with that which ye do
27|89|Whoever shall have wrought righteousness, shall receive a reward beyond the desert thereof; and they shall be secure from the terror of that day
27|90|But whoever shall have wrought evil, shall be thrown on their faces into hell fire. Shall ye receive the reward of any other than of that which ye shall have wrought
27|91|Verily I am commanded to worship the Lord of this territory of Mecca, Who hath sanctified the same: Unto Him belong all things. And I am commanded to be a Moslem
27|92|and to rehearse the Koran: He who shall be directed thereby, will be directed to his own advantage; and to him who shall go astray, say, verily I am a warner only
27|93|And say, praise be unto God! He will shew you his signs, and ye shall know them: And thy Lord is not regardless of that which they do
28|1|M
28|2|These are the signs of the perspicuous book
28|3|We will dictate unto thee, O Mohammed, some parts of the history of Moses and Pharaoh, with truth; for the sake of people who believe
28|4|Now Pharaoh lifted himself up in the land of Egypt; and he caused his subjects to be divided into parties: He weakened one party of them, by slaying their male-children, and preserving their females alive; for he was an oppressor
28|5|And We were minded to be gracious unto those who were weakened in the land, and to make them models of religion; and to make them the heirs of the wealth of Pharaoh and his people
28|6|and to establish a place for them in the earth; and to shew Pharaoh, and Haman, and their forces, that destruction of their kingdom and nation by them, which they sought to avoid
28|7|And We directed the mother of Moses by revelation, saying, give him suck: And if thou fearest for him, cast him into the river; and fear not, neither be afflicted; for We will restore him unto thee, and will appoint him one of our apostles
28|8|And when she had put the child in the ark, and had cast it into the river, the family of Pharaoh took him up; providence designing that he should become an enemy, and a sorrow unto them. Verily Pharaoh, and Haman, and their forces were sinners
28|9|And the wife of Pharaoh said, this child is a delight of the eye to me, and to thee: Kill him not; peradventure it may happen that he may be serviceable unto us; or we may adopt him for our son. And they perceived not the consequence of what they were doing
28|10|And the heart of the mother of Moses became oppressed with fear; and she had almost discovered him, had We not armed her heart with constancy, that she might be one of those who believe the promises of God
28|11|And she said unto his sister, follow him. And she watched him at a distance; and they perceived it not
28|12|And We suffered him not to take the breasts of the nurses who were provided before his sister came up: And she said, shall I direct you unto some of his nation, who may nurse him for you, and will be careful of him
28|13|And, at their desire, she brought his mother to them. So We restored him to his mother, that her mind might be set at ease, and that she might not be afflicted; and that she might know that the promise of God was true: But the greater part of mankind know not the truth
28|14|And when Moses had attained his age of full strength, and was become a perfect man, We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge: And thus do We reward the upright
28|15|And he went into the city, at a time when the inhabitants thereof observed not what passed in the streets: And he found therein two men fighting; the one being of his own party, and the other of his enemies. And he who was of his party, begged his assistance against him who was of the contrary party; and Moses struck him with his fist, and slew him: But being sorry for what had happened, he said, this is of the work of the devil; for he is a seducing and an open enemy
28|16|And he said, O Lord, verily I have injured my own soul: Wherefore forgive me. So God forgave him; for He is ready to forgive, and merciful
28|17|He said, O Lord, by the favours with which thou hast favoured me, I will not be an assistant to the wicked for the future
28|18|And the next morning he was afraid in the city, and looked about him, as one apprehensive of danger: And behold, he whom he had assisted the day before, cried out unto him for help a secong time. But Moses said unto him, thou art plainly a quarrelsome fellow
28|19|And when he sought to lay hold on him who was an enemy unto them both, he said, O Moses, dost thou intend to kill me, as thou killedst a man yesterday? Thou seekest only to be an oppressor in the earth, and seekest not to be a reconciler of quarrels
28|20|And a certain man came from the farther part of the city, running hastily, and said, O Moses, verily the magistrates are deliberating concerning thee, to put thee to death: Depart therefore; I certainly advise thee well
28|21|Wherefore he departed out of the city in great fear, looking this way and that, lest he should be pursued. And he said, O Lord, deliver me from the unjust people
28|22|And when he was journeying towards Madian, he said, peradventure my Lord will direct me in the right way
28|23|And when he arrived at the water of Madian, he found about the well a company of men, who were watering their flocks. And he found, besides them, two women, who kept off their sheep at a distance. And he said unto them, what is the matter with you? They answered, we shall not water our flock, until the shepherds shall have driven away theirs; for our father is an old man, stricken in years
28|24|So Moses watered their sheep for them; and afterwards retired to the shade, saying, O Lord, verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down unto me
28|25|And one of the damsels came unto him, walking bashfully, and said, my father calleth thee, that he may recompence thee for the trouble which thou hast taken in watering our sheep for us. And when he was come unto Shoaib, and had told him the story of his adventures, he said unto him, fear not; thou hast escaped from unjust people
28|26|And one of the damsels said, my father, hire him for certain wages: The best servant thou canst hire, is an able and trusty person
28|27|And Shoaib said unto Moses, verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight years: And if thou fulfill ten years, it is in thine own breast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee: And thou shalt find me, if God please, a man of probity
28|28|Moses answered, let this be the covenant between me and thee: Whichsoever of the two terms I shall fulfil, let it be no crime in me if I then quit thy service; and God is witness of that which we say
28|29|And when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was journeying with his family towards Egypt, he saw fire on the side of mount Sinai. And he said unto his family, tarry ye here; for I see fire: Peradventure I may bring you thence some tidings of the way, or at least a brand out of the fire, that ye may be warmed
28|30|And when he was come thereto, a voice cried unto him from the right side of the valley, in the sacred bottom, from the tree, saying, O Moses, verily I am God, the Lord of all creatures
28|31|Cast down now thy rod. And when he saw it that it moved, as though it had been a serpent, he retreated and fled, and returned not. And God said unto him, O Moses, draw near, and fear not; for thou art safe
28|32|Put thy hand into thy bosom, and it shall come forth white, without any hurt: And draw back thy hand unto thee which thou stretchest forth for fear. These shall be two evident signs from thy Lord, unto Pharaoh and his princes; for they are a wicked people
28|33|Moses said, O Lord, verily I have slain one of them; and I fear they will put me to death
28|34|But my brother Aaron is of a more eloquent tongue than I am; wherefore send him with me for an assistant, that he may gain me credit; for I fear lest they accuse me of imposture
28|35|God said, We will strengthen thine arm by thy brother, and We will give each of you extraordinary power, so that they shall not come up to you, in our signs. Ye two, and whoever shall follow you, shall be the conquerors
28|36|And when Moses came unto them with our evident signs, they said, this is no other than a deceitful piece of sorcery: Neither have we heard of any thing like this among our fore-fathers
28|37|And Moses said, My Lord best knoweth who cometh with a direction from Him; and who shall have success in this life, as well as the next: But the unjust shall not prosper
28|38|And Pharaoh said, O princes, I did not know that ye had any other god besides me. Wherefore do thou, O Haman, burn me clay into bricks; and build me a high tower, that I may ascend unto the God of Moses: For I verily believe him to be a liar
28|39|And both he and his forces behaved themselves insolently and unjustly in the earth; and imagined that they should not be brought before Us to be judged
28|40|Wherefore We took him and his forces, and cast them into the sea. Behold, therefore, what was the end of the unjust
28|41|And We made them deceitful guides, inviting their followers to hell fire; and on the day of resurrection they shall not be screened from punishment
28|42|We pursued them with a curse in this life; and on the day of resurrection they shall be shamefully rejected
28|43|And We gave the book of the law unto Moses, after We had destroyed the former generations, to enlighten the minds of men, and for a direction, and a mercy; that peradventure they might consider
28|44|Thou, O prophet, wast not on the west side of mount Sinai, when We delivered Moses his commission: Neither wast thou one of those who were present at his receiving it
28|45|But we raised up several generations after Moses; and life was prolonged unto them. Neither didst thou dwell among the inhabitants of Madian, rehearsing unto them our signs; but We have sent thee fully instructed in every particular
28|46|Nor wast thou present on the side of the mount, when We called unto Moses: But thou art sent as a mercy from they Lord; that thou mightest preach unto a people to whom no preacher hath come before thee, that peradventure they may be warned
28|47|and lest, if a calamity had befallen them, for that which their hands had previously committed, they should have said, O Lord, since thou hast not sent an apostle unto us, that we might follow thy signs, and become true believers, are we not excusable
28|48|Yet when the truth is come unto them from before us, they say, unless he receive the same power to work miracles as Moses received, we will not believe. Have they not likewise rejected the revelation which was heretofore given unto Moses? They say, two cunning impostures have mutually assisted one another: And they say, verily we reject them both
28|49|Say, produce therefore a book from God, which is more right than these two, that I may follow it; if ye speak truth
28|50|But if they return thee no answer, know that they only follow their own desires: And who erreth more widely from the truth than he who followeth his own desire, without a direction from God? Verily God directeth not the unjust people
28|51|And now have We caused our word to come unto them, that they may be admonished
28|52|They unto whom We have given the scriptures which were revealed before it, believe in the same
28|53|and when it is read unto them, say, we believe therein; it is certainly the truth from our Lord: Verily we were Moslems before this
28|54|These shall receive their reward twice, because they have persevered, and repel evil by good, and distribute alms out of that which We have bestowed on them
28|55|and when they hear vain discourse, avoid the same, saying, we have our works, and ye have your works: Peace be on you; we covet not the acquaintance of the ignorant
28|56|Verily thou canst not direct whom thou wilt: But God directeth whom He pleaseth, and He best knoweth those who will submit to be directed
28|57|The Meccans say, if we follow the same direction with thee, we shall be forcibly expelled our land. Have We not established for them a secure asylum; to which fruits of every sort are brought, as a provision of our bounty? But the greater part of them do not understand
28|58|How many cities have We destroyed, whose inhabitants lived in ease and plenty? And these their dwellings are not inhabited after them, unless for a little while; and We were the inheritors of their wealth
28|59|But thy Lord did not destroy those cities, until He had sent unto their capital an apostle, to rehearse our signs unto them: Neither did We destroy those cities, unless their inhabitants were injurious to their apostle
28|60|The things which are given you, are the provisions of this present life, and the pomp thereof; but that which is with God, is better and more durable: Will ye not therefore understand
28|61|Shall he then, unto whom We have promised an excellent promise of future happiness, and who shall attain the same, be as he on whom we have bestowed the provision of this present life, and who, on the day of resurrection, shall be one of those who are delivered up to eternal punishment
28|62|On that day God shall call unto them, and shall say, where are my partners, which ye imagined to be so
28|63|And they upon whom the sentence of damnation shall be justly pronounced, shall answer, these, O Lord, are those whom we seduced; we seduced them as we also had been seduced: But now we clearly quit them, and turn unto Thee. They did not worship Us, but their own lusts
28|64|And it shall be said unto the idolaters, call now upon those whom ye associated with God: And they shall call upon them, but they shall not answer them; and they shall see the punishment prepared for them, and shall wish that they had submitted to be directed
28|65|On that day God shall call unto them, and shall say, what answer did ye return to our messengers
28|66|But they shall not be able to give an account thereof on that day; neither shall they ask one another for information
28|67|Howbeit whoso shall repent and believe, and shall do that which is right, may expect to be happy
28|68|Thy Lord createth what He pleaseth; and chooseth freely: But they have no free choice. Praise be unto God; and far be He removed from the idols which they associate with Him
28|69|Thy Lord knoweth both the secret malice which their breasts conceal, and the open hatred which they discover
28|70|He is God; there is no God but He. Unto Him is the praise due, both in this life and in that which is to come: Unto Him doth judgment belong; and before Him shall ye be assembled at the last day
28|71|Say, what think ye? If God should cover you with perpetual night, until the day of resurrection; what god, besides God, would bring you light? Will ye not therefore hearken
28|72|Say, what think ye? If God should give you continual day, until the day of resurrection; what god, besides God, would bring you night, that ye might rest therein? Will ye not therefore consider
28|73|Of his mercy He hath made for you the night and the day, that ye may rest in the one, and may seek to obtain provision for your selves of his abundance, by your industry, in the other; and that ye may give thanks
28|74|On a certain day God shall call unto them, and shall say, where are my partners, which ye imagined to share the divine power with Me
28|75|And We will produce a witness out of every nation, and will say, bring hither your proof of what ye have asserted. And they shall know that the right is God's alone; and the deities which they have devised shall abandon them
28|76|Karun was of the people of Moses; but he behaved insolently towards them: For We had given him so much treasure, that his keys would have loaded several strong men. When his people said unto Him, rejoice not immoderately; for God loveth not those who rejoice in their riches immoderately
28|77|But seek to attain, by means of the wealth which God hath given thee, the future mansion of paradise. And forget not thy portion in this world; but be thou bounteous unto others, as God hath been bounteous unto thee: And seek not to act corruptly in the earth; for God loveth not the corrupt doers
28|78|He answered, I have received these riches, only because of the knowledge which is with me. Did he not know that God had already destroyed, before him, several generations, who were mightier than he in strength, and had amassed more abundance of riches? And the wicked shall not be asked to discover their crimes
28|79|And Karun went forth unto his people, in his pomp. And they who loved this present life, said, oh that we had the like wealth, as hath been given unto Karun! Verily he is master of a great fortune
28|80|But those on whom knowledge had been bestowed, answered, alas for you! The reward of God in the next life, will be better unto him who shall believe and do good works: But none shall attain the same, except those who persevere with constancy
28|81|And We caused the ground to cleave in sunder, and to swallow up him and his palace: And he had no forces to defend him, besides God; neither was he rescued from punishment
28|82|And the next morning, those who had coveted his condition the day before, said, aha! Verily God bestoweth abundant provision on such of his servants as He pleaseth; and He is sparing unto whom He pleaseth. Unless God had been gracious unto us, certainly the earth had swallowed us up also. Aha! The unbelievers shall not prosper
28|83|As to this future mansion of paradise, We will give it unto them who seek not to exalt themselves in the earth, or to do wrong; for the happy issue shall attend the pious
28|84|Whoso doth good, shall receive a reward which shall exceed the merit thereof: But as to him who doth evil, they who work evil shall be rewarded according to the merit only of that which they shall have wrought
28|85|Verily He who hath given thee the Koran for a rule of faith and practice, will certainly bring thee back home unto Mecca. Say, my Lord best knoweth who cometh with a true direction, and who is in a manifest error
28|86|Thou didst not expect that the book of the Koran should be delivered unto thee: But thou hast received it through the mercy of thy Lord. Be not therefore assisting to the unbelievers
28|87|neither let them turn thee aside from the signs of God, after they have been sent down unto thee: And invite men unto thy Lord. And be not thou an idolater
28|88|neither invoke any other god, together with the true God: There is no god but He. Every thing shall perish, except Himself: Unto Him belongeth judgment; and before Him shall ye be assembled at the last day
29|1|M
29|2|Do men imagine that it shall be sufficient for them to say, we believe; while they be not proved
29|3|We heretofore proved those who were before them; for God will surely know them who are sincere, and He will surely know the liars
29|4|Do they who work evil think that they shall prevent Us from taking vengeance on them? An ill judgment do they make
29|5|Whoso hopeth to meet God, verily God's appointed time will certainly come; and He both heareth and knoweth
29|6|Whoever striveth to promote the true religion, striveth for the advantage of his own soul; for God needeth not any of his creatures
29|7|And as to those who believe and work righteousness, We will expiate their evil deeds from them; and We will give them a reward according to the utmost merit of their actions
29|8|We have commanded man to shew kindness towards his parents: But if they endeavour to prevail with thee to associate with Me that concerning which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not. Unto Me shall ye return; and I will declare unto you what ye have done
29|9|Those who shall believe, and shall work righteousness, We will surely introduce into paradise, among the upright
29|10|There are some men who say, we believe in God: But when such a one is afflicted for God's sake, he esteemeth the persecution of men to be as grievous as the punishment of God. Yet if success cometh from thy Lord, they say, verily we are with you. Doth not God well know that which is in the breasts of his creatures
29|11|Verily God well knoweth the true believers, and He well knoweth the hypocrites
29|12|The unbelievers say unto those who believe, follow our way; and we will bear your sins. Howbeit they shall not bear any part of their sins; for they are liars
29|13|But they shall surely bear their own burdens, and other burdens besides their own burdens; and they shall be examined, on the day of resurrection, concerning that which they have falsely devised
29|14|We heretofore sent Noah unto his people; and he tarried among them one thousand years, save fifty years: And the deluge took them away, while they were acting unjustly
29|15|but We delivered him and those who were in the ark, and We made the same a sign unto all creatures
29|16|We also sent Abraham; when he said unto his people, serve God, and fear Him: This will be better for you; if ye understand
29|17|Ye only worship idols besides God, and forge a lie. Verily those which ye worship, besides God, are not able to make any provision for you: Seek therefore your provision from God; and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him; unto Him shall ye return
29|18|If ye charge me with imposture, verily sundry nations before you likewise charged their prophets with imposture: But public preaching only is incumbent on an apostle
29|19|Do they not see how God produceth creatures, and afterwards restoreth them? Verily this is easy with God
29|20|Say, go through the earth, and see how He originally produceth creatures: Afterwards will God reproduce another production; for God is almighty
29|21|He will punish whom He pleaseth, and He will have mercy on whom He pleaseth. Before Him shall ye be brought at the day of judgment
29|22|And ye shall not escape his reach, either in earth, or in heaven; neither shall ye have any patron or defender besides God
29|23|As for those who believe not in the signs of God, or that they shall meet Him at the resurrection, they shall despair of my mercy, and for them is a painful punishment prepared
29|24|And the answer of his people was no other than that they said, slay him, or burn him. But God saved him from the fire. Verily herein were signs unto people who believed
29|25|And Abraham said, ye have taken idols, besides God, to cement affection between you in this life: But on the day of resurrection, the one of you shall deny the other, and the one of you shall curse the other; and your abode shall be hell fire, and there shall be none to deliver you
29|26|And Lot believed on Him. And Abraham said, verily I fly from my people, unto the place which my Lord hath commanded me; for He is the mighty, the wise
29|27|And We gave him Isaac, and Jacob; and We placed among his descendants the gift of prophecy and the scriptures: And We gave him his reward in this world; and in the next he shall be one of the righteous
29|28|We also sent Lot; when he said unto his people, do ye commit filthiness which no creature hath committed before you
29|29|Do ye approach lustfully unto men, and lay wait in the highways, and commit wickedness in your assembly? And the answer of his people was no other than that they said, bring down the vengeance of God upon us, if thou speakest truth
29|30|Lot said, O Lord, defend me against the corrupt people
29|31|And when our messengers came unto Abraham with good tidings, they said, we will surely destroy the inhabitants of this city; for the inhabitants thereof are unjust doers
29|32|Abraham answered, verily Lot dwelleth there. They replied, we well know who dwelleth therein: we will surely deliver him and his family, except his wife; she shall be one of those who remain behind
29|33|And when our messengers came unto Lot, he was troubled for them, and his arm was straitened concerning them. But they said, fear not, neither be grieved; for we will deliver thee and thy family, except thy wife; for she shall be one of those who remain behind
29|34|We will surely bring down upon the inhabitants of this city vengeance from heaven, for that they have been wicked doers
29|35|And We have left thereof a manifest sign unto people who understand
29|36|And unto the inhabitants of Madian We sent their brother Shoaib; and he said unto them, O my people, serve God, and expect the last day; and transgress not, acting corruptly in the earth
29|37|But they accused him of imposture; wherefore a storm from heaven assailed them, and in the morning they were found in their dwellings dead and prostrate
29|38|And We also destroyed the tribes of Ad, and Thamud; and this is well known unto you from what yet remains of their dwellings. And Satan prepared their works for them, and turned them aside from the way of truth; although they were sagacious people
29|39|And We likewise destroyed Karun, and Pharaoh, and Haman. Moses came unto them with evident miracles; and they behaved themselves insolently in the earth: But they could not escape our vengeance
29|40|Every of them did We destroy in his sin. Against some of them We sent a violent wind: Some of them did a terrible noise from heaven destroy: Some of them did We cause the earth to swallow up: And some of them We drowned. Neither was God disposed to treat them unjustly; but they dealt unjustly with their own souls
29|41|The likness of those who take other patrons besides God, is as the likeness of the spider, which maketh herself a house: But the weakest of all houses surely is the house of the spider; if they knew this
29|42|Moreover God knoweth what things they invoke, besides Him; and He is the mighty, the wise
29|43|These similitudes do We propound unto men: But none understand them, except the wise
29|44|God hath created the heavens and the earth in truth: Verily herein is a sign unto the true believers
29|45|Rehearse that which hath been revealed unto thee of the book of the Koran: And be constant at prayer; for prayer preserveth a man from filthy crimes, and from that which is blamable; and the remembering of God is surely a most important duty. God knoweth that which ye do
29|46|Dispute not against those who have received the scriptures, unless in the mildest manner; except against such of them as behave injuriously towards you: And say, we believe in the revelation which hath been sent down unto us, and also in that which hath been sent down unto you; our God and your God is one, and unto Him are we resigned
29|47|Thus have We sent down the book of the Koran unto thee: And they unto whom We have given the former scriptures, believe therein; and of these Arabians also there is who believeth therein: And none reject our signs, except the obstinate infidels
29|48|Thou couldest not read any book before this; neither couldest thou write it with thy right hand: Then had the gainsayers justly doubted of the divine original thereof
29|49|But the same is evident signs in the breasts of those who have received understanding: For none reject our signs, except the unjust
29|50|They say, unless a sign be sent down unto him from his Lord, we will not believe. Answer, signs are in the power of God alone; and I am no more than a public preacher
29|51|Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down unto thee the book of the Koran, to be read unto them? Verily herein is a mercy, and an admonition unto people who believe
29|52|Say, God is a sufficient witness between me and you: He knoweth whatever is in heaven and earth; and those who believe in vain idols, and deny God, they shall perish
29|53|They will urge thee to hasten the punishment which they defy thee to bring down upon them: If there had not been a determined time for their respite, the punishment had come upon them before this; but it shall surely overtake them suddenly, and they shall not foresee it
29|54|They urge thee to bring down vengeance swiftly upon them: But hell shall surely encompass the unbelievers
29|55|On a certain day their punishment shall suddenly assail them, both from above them, and from under their feet; and God shall say, taste ye the reward of that which ye have wrought
29|56|O my servants who have believed, verily my earth is spacious; wherefore serve Me
29|57|Every soul shall taste death: Afterwards shall ye return unto Us
29|58|and as for those who shall have believed, and wrought righteousness, We will surely lodge them in the higher apartments of paradise; rivers shall flow beneath them, and they shall continue therein for ever. How excellent will be the reward of the workers of righteousness
29|59|who persevere with patience, and put their trust in their Lord
29|60|How many beasts are there, which provide not their food? It is God who provideth food for them, and for you; and He both heareth and knoweth
29|61|Verily, if thou ask the Meccans, who hath created the heavens and the earth, and hath obliged the sun and the moon to serve in their courses; they will answer, God. How therefore do they lie, in acknowledging of other gods
29|62|God maketh abundant provision for such of his servants as He pleaseth; and is sparing unto him, if he pleaseth: For God knoweth all things
29|63|Verily if thou ask them, who sendeth rain from heaven, and thereby quickeneth the earth, after it hath been dead; they will answer, God. Say, God be praised! But the greater part of them do not understand
29|64|This present life is no other than a toy, and a play-thing; but the future mansion of paradise is life indeed: If they knew this, they would not prefer the former to the latter
29|65|When they sail in a ship, they call upon God, sincerely exhibiting unto Him the true religion: But when He bringeth them safe to land, behold, they return to their idolatry
29|66|to shew themselves ungrateful for that which We have bestowed on them, and that they may enjoy the delights of this life; but they shall hereafter know the issue
29|67|Do they not see that We have made the territory of Mecca an inviolable and secure asylum, when men are spoiled in the countries round about them? Do they therefore believe in that which is vain, and acknowledge not the goodness of God
29|68|But who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie against God, or denieth the truth, when it hath come unto him? Is there not in hell an abode for the unbelievers
29|69|Whoever do their utmost endeavour to promote our true religion, We will direct them into our ways; for God is with the righteous
30|1|M
30|2|The Greeks have been overcome by the Persians
30|3|in the nearest part of the land; but after their defeat, they shall overcome the others in their turn
30|4|within a few years. Unto God belongeth the disposal of this matter, both for what is past, and for what is to come: And on that day shall the believers rejoice
30|5|in the success granted by God; for He granteth success unto whom He pleaseth, and He is the mighty, the merciful
30|6|This is the promise of God: God will not act contrary to his promise; but the greater part of men know not the veracity of God
30|7|They know the outward appearance of this present life; but they are careless as to the life to come
30|8|Do they not consider within themselves that God hath not created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, otherwise than in truth, and hath set them a determined period? Verily a great number of men reject the belief of their future meeting their Lord at the resurrection
30|9|Do they not pass through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who were before them? They excelled the Meccans in strength, and broke up the earth, and inhabited it in greater affluence and prosperity than they inhabit the same: And their apostles came unto them with evident miracles; and God was not disposed to treat them unjustly, but they injured their own souls by their obstinate infidelity
30|10|and the end of those who had done evil, was evil, because they charged the signs of God with falsehood, and laughed the same to scorn
30|11|God produceth creatures, and will hereafter restore them to life: Then shall ye return unto Him
30|12|And on the day whereon the hour shall come, the wicked shall be struck dumb for despair
30|13|And they shall have no intercessors from among the idols which they associated with God; and they shall deny the false gods which they associated with Him
30|14|On the day whereon the hour shall come, on that day shall the true believers and the infidels be separated
30|15|And they who shall have believed, and wrought righteousness, shall take their pleasure in a delightful meadow
30|16|but as for those who shall have disbelieved, and rejected our signs, and the meeting of the next life, they shall be delivered up to punishment
30|17|Wherefore glorify God, when the evening overtaketh you, and when ye rise in the morning
30|18|And unto Him be praise in heaven and earth; and at sun-set, and when ye rest at noon
30|19|He bringeth forth the living out of the dead, and He bringeth forth the dead out of the living; and He quickeneth the earth after it hath been dead: And in like manner shall ye be brought forth from your graves
30|20|Of his signs one is, that He hath created you of dust; and behold, ye are become men, spread over the face of the earth
30|21|And of his signs another is, that He hath created for you, out of your selves, wives, that ye may cohabit with them; and hath put love and compassion between you: Verily herein are signs unto people who consider
30|22|And of his signs are also the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variety of your languages, and of your complexions: Verily herein are signs unto men of understanding
30|23|And of his signs are your sleeping by night and by day, and your seeking to provide for yourselves of his abundance: Verily herein are signs unto people who hearken
30|24|Of his signs others are, that He sheweth you the lightening, to strike terror, and to give hope of rain, and that He sendeth down water from heaven, and quickeneth thereby the earth, after it hath been dead: Verily herein are signs unto people who understand
30|25|And of his signs this also is one, namely, that the heaven and the earth stand firm at his command: Hereafter, when He shall call you out of the earth at one summons, behold, ye shall come forth
30|26|Unto Him are subject whosoever are in the heavens and on earth: All are obedient unto Him
30|27|It is He who originally produceth a creature, and afterwards restoreth the same to life: And this is most easy with Him. He justly challengeth the most exalted comparison, in heaven and earth; and He is the mighty, the wise
30|28|He propoundeth unto you a comparison taken from yourselves. Have ye, among the slaves whom your right hands possess, any partner in the substance which We have bestowed on you, so that ye become equal sharers therein with them, or that ye fear them as ye fear one another? Thus do We distinctly explain our signs, unto people who understand
30|29|But those who act unjustly by attributing companions unto God, follow their own lusts, without knowledge: And who shall direct him whom God shall cause to err? They shall have none to help them
30|30|Wherefore be thou orthodox, and set thy face towards the true religion, the institution of God, to which He hath created mankind disposed: There is no change in what God hath created. This is the right religion; but the greater part of men know it not
30|31|And be ye turned unto Him, and fear Him, and be constant at prayer, and be not idolaters
30|32|Of those who have made a schism in their religion, and are divided into various sects; every sect rejoice in their own opinion
30|33|When adversity befalleth men, they call upon their Lord, turning unto Him: Afterwards, when He hath caused them to taste of his mercy, behold, a part of them associate other deities with their Lord
30|34|to shew themselves ungrateful for the favours which We have bestowed on them. Enjoy therefore the vain pleasures of this life; but hereafter shall ye know the consequence
30|35|Have We sent down unto them any authority, which speaketh of the false gods which they associate with Him
30|36|When We cause men to taste mercy, they rejoice therein; but if evil befalleth them, for that which their hands have before committed, behold, they despair
30|37|Do they not see that God bestoweth provision abundantly on whom He pleaseth, and is sparing unto whom He pleaseth? Verily herein are signs unto people who believe
30|38|Give unto Him who is of kin to thee his reasonable due; and also to the poor, and the stranger: This is better for those who seek the face of God; and they shall prosper
30|39|Whatever ye shall give in usury, to be an increase of men's substance, shall not be increased by the blessing of God: But whatever ye shall give in alms, for God's sake, they shall receive a twofold reward
30|40|It is God who hath created you, and hath provided food for you: Hereafter will He cause you to die; and after that will He raise you again to life. Is there any of your false gods, who is able to do the least of these things? Praise be unto Him; and far be He removed from what they associate with Him
30|41|Corruption hath appeared by land and by sea, for the crimes which men's hands have committed; that it might make them to taste a part of the fruits of that which they have wrought, that peradventure they might turn from their evil ways
30|42|Say, go through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who have been before you: The greater part of them were idolaters
30|43|Set thy face therefore towards the right religion, before the day cometh, which none can put back from God. On that day shall they be separated into two companies
30|44|Whoever shall have been an unbeliever, on Him shall his unbelief be charged; and whoever shall have done that which is right, shall spread themselves couches of repose in paradise
30|45|that He may reward those who shall believe, and work righteousness, of his abundant liberality; for He loveth not the unbelievers
30|46|Of his signs one is, that He sendeth the winds, bearing welcome tidings of rain, that He may cause you to taste of his mercy; and that ships may sail at his command, that ye may seek to enrich your selves of his abundance by commerce; and that ye may give thanks
30|47|We sent apostles, before thee, unto their respective people, and they came unto them with evident proofs: And We took vengeance on those who did wickedly; and it was incumbent on Us to assist the true believers
30|48|It is God who sendeth the winds, and raiseth the clouds, and spreadeth the same in the heaven, as He pleaseth; and afterwards disperseth the same: And thou mayest see the rain issuing from the midst thereof; and when He poureth the same down on such of his servants as He pleaseth, behold, they are filled with joy
30|49|although before it was sent down unto them, before such relief, they were despairing
30|50|Consider therefore the traces of God's mercy; how He quickeneth the earth, after its state of death: Verily the same will raise the dead; for He is almighty
30|51|Yet if We should send a blasting wind, and they should see their corn yellow and burnt up, they would surely become ungrateful, after our former favours
30|52|Thou canst not make the dead to hear, neither canst thou make the deaf to hear thy call, when they retire and turn their backs
30|53|neither canst thou direct the blind out of their error: Thou shalt make none to hear, except him who shall believe in our signs; for they are resigned unto Us
30|54|It is God who created you in weakness, and after weakness hath given you strength; and after strength, he will again reduce you to weakness, and grey hairs: He createth that which He pleaseth; and He is the wise, the powerful
30|55|On the day whereon the last hour shall come, the wicked will swear that they have not tarried above an hour: In like manner did they utter lies in their life-time
30|56|But those on whom knowledge hath been bestowed, and faith, will say, ye have tarried, according to the book of God, until the day of resurrection: For this is the day of resurrection; but ye knew it not
30|57|On that day their excuse shall not avail those who have acted unjustly; neither shall they be invited any more to make themselves acceptable unto God
30|58|And now have We propounded unto men, in this Koran, parables of every kind: Yet if thou bring them a verse thereof, the unbelievers will surely say, ye are no other than publishers of vain falsehoods
30|59|Thus hath God sealed up the hearts of those who believe not
30|60|But do thou, O Mohammed, persevere with constancy, for the promise of God is true; and let not those induce thee to waver, who have no certain knowledge
31|1|M
31|2|These are the signs of the wise book
31|3|a direction, and a mercy unto the righteous
31|4|who observe the appointed times of prayer, and give alms, and have firm assurance in the life to come
31|5|These are directed by their Lord, and they shall prosper
31|6|There is a man who purchaseth a ludicrous story, that he may seduce men from the way of God, without knowledge, and may laugh the same to scorn: These shall suffer a shameful punishment
31|7|And when our signs are rehearsed unto him, he disdainfully turneth his back, as though he heard them not, as though there were a deafness in his ears: Wherefore denounce unto him a grievous punishment
31|8|But they who shall believe, and work righteousness, shall enjoy gardens of pleasure
31|9|they shall continue therein for ever: This is the certain promise of God; and he is the mighty, the wise
31|10|He hath created the heavens without visible pillars to sustain them, and hath thrown on the earth mountains firmly rooted, lest it should move with you; and He hath replenished the same with all kinds of beasts: And We send down rain from heaven, and cause every kind of noble vegetable to spring forth therein
31|11|This is the creation of God: Shew Me now what they have created, who are worshipped besides Him? Verily the ungodly are in a manifest error
31|12|We heretofore bestowed wisdom on Lokman, and commanded him, saying, be thou thankful unto God: For whoever is thankful, shall be thankful to the advantage of his own soul; and if any shall be unthankful, verily God is self-sufficient, and worthy to be praised
31|13|And remember when Lokman said unto his son, as he admonished him, O my son, give not a partner unto God; for polytheism is a great impiety
31|14|We have commanded man concerning his parents, -- his mother carrieth him in her womb with weakness and faintness, and he is weaned in two years, -- saying, be grateful unto Me, and to thy parents. Unto Me shall all come to be judged
31|15|But if thy parents endeavour to prevail on thee to associate with Me that concerning which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not: Bear them company in this world in what shall be reasonable; but follow the way of him who sincerely turneth unto Me. Hereafter unto Me shall ye return, and then will I declare unto you that which ye have done
31|16|O my son, verily every matter, whether good or bad, though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and be hidden in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring the same to light; for God is clear-sighted and knowing
31|17|O my son, be constant at prayer, and command that which is just, and forbid that which is evil: And be patient under the afflictions which shall befall thee; for this is a duty absolutely incumbent on all men
31|18|Distort not thy face out of contempt to men, neither walk in the earth with insolence; for God loveth no arrogant, vain-glorious person
31|19|And be moderate in thy pace: And lower thy voice; for the most ungrateful of all voices surely is the voice of asses
31|20|Do ye not see that God hath subjected whatever is in heaven and on earth to your service, and hath abundantly poured on you his favours, both outwardly and inwardly? There are some men who dispute concerning God without knowledge, and without a direction, and without an enlightening book
31|21|And when it is said unto them, follow that which God hath revealed; they answer, nay, we will follow that which we found our fathers to practise. What, though the devil invite them to the torment of hell
31|22|Whoever resigneth himself unto God, being a worker of righteousness, taketh hold on a strong handle; and unto God belongeth the issue of all things
31|23|But whoever shall be an unbeliever, let not his unbelief grieve thee: Unto Us shall they return; then will We declare unto them that which they have done, for God knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
31|24|We will suffer them to enjoy this world for a little while: Afterwards We will drive them to a severe punishment
31|25|If thou ask them who hath created the heavens and the earth, they will surely answer, God. Say, God be praised! But the greater part of them do not understand
31|26|Unto God belongeth whatever is in heaven and earth: For God is the self-sufficient, the praise-worthy
31|27|If whatever trees are in the earth were pens, and he should after that swell the sea into seven seas of ink, the words of God would not be exhausted; for God is mighty, and wise
31|28|Your creation and your resuscitation are but as the creation and resuscitation of one soul: Verily God both heareth and seeth
31|29|Dost thou not see that God causeth the night to succeed the day, and causeth the day to succeed the night, and compelleth the sun and the moon to serve you? Each of those luminaries hasteneth in its course to a determined period: And God is well-acquainted with that which ye do
31|30|This is declared concerning the divine knowledge and power, for that God is the true being, and for that whatever ye invoke, besides him, is vanity; and for that God is the high, the great God
31|31|Dost thou not see that the ships run in the sea, through the favour of God, that he may shew you of his signs? Verily herein are signs, unto every patient, grateful person
31|32|When waves cover them, like overshadowing clouds, they call upon God, exhibiting the pure religion unto him; but when He bringeth them safe to land, there is of them who halteth between the true faith and idolatry
31|33|O men, fear your Lord, and dread the day whereon a father shall not make satisfaction for his son, neither shall a son make satisfaction for his father at all: The promise of God is assuredly true. Let not this present life, therefore, deceive you; neither let the deceiver deceive you concerning God
31|34|Verily the knowledge of the hour of judgment is with God: And He causeth the rain to descend, at his own appointed time; and He knoweth what is in the wombs of females. No soul knoweth what it shall gain on the morrow; neither doth any soul know in what land it shall die: But God is knowing and fully acquainted with all things
32|1|M
32|2|The revelation of this book, there is no doubt thereof, is from the Lord of all creatures
32|3|Will they say, Mohammed hath forged it? Nay, it is the truth from thy Lord, that thou mayest preach to a people, unto whom no preacher hath come before thee; peradventure they will be directed
32|4|It is God who hath created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, in six days; and then ascended his throne. Ye have no patron or intercessor besides Him. Will ye not therefore consider
32|5|He governeth all things from heaven even to the earth: Hereafter shall they return unto Him, on the day whose length shall be a thousand years, of those which ye compute
32|6|This is He who knoweth the future, and the present; the mighty, the merciful
32|7|It is He who hath made every thing which He hath created exceeding good; and first created man of clay
32|8|and afterwards made his posterity of an extract of despicable water
32|9|and then formed him into proper shape, and breathed of his spirit into him; and hath given you the senses of hearing and seeing, and hearts to understand. How small thanks do ye return
32|10|And they say, when we shall lie hidden in the earth, shall we be raised thence a new creature? Yea, they deny the meeting of their Lord at the resurrection
32|11|Say, the angel of death, who is set over you, shall cause you to die: Then shall ye be brought back unto your Lord
32|12|If thou couldest see, when the wicked shall bow down their heads before their Lord, saying, O Lord, we have seen, and have heard: Suffer us therefore to return into the world, and we will work that which is right; since we are now certain of the truth of what hath been preached to us: Thou wouldst see an amazing sight
32|13|If we had pleased, we had certainly given unto every soul its direction: But the word which hath proceeded from Me must necessarily be fulfilled, when I said, verily I will fill hell with genii and men, altogether
32|14|Taste therefore the torment prepared for you, because ye have forgotten the coming of this your day: We also have forgotten you; taste therefore a punishment of eternal duration, for that which ye have wrought
32|15|Verily they only believe in our signs, who, when they are warned thereby, fall down adoring, and celebrate the praise of their Lord, and are not elated with pride
32|16|Their sides are raised from their beds, calling on their Lord with fear and with hope; and they distribute alms out of what We have bestowed on them
32|17|No soul knoweth the complete satisfaction which is secretly prepared for them, as a reward for that which they have wrought
32|18|Shall he therefore, who is a true believer, be as he who is an impious transgressor? They shall not be held equal
32|19|As to those who believe, and do that which is right, they shall have gardens of perpetual abode, an ample recompense for that which they shall have wrought
32|20|But as for those who impiously transgress, their abode shall be hell fire; so often as they shall endeavour to get thereout, they shall be dragged back into the same, and it shall be said unto them, taste ye the torment of hell fire, which ye rejected as a falsehood
32|21|And we will cause them to taste the nearer punishment of this world, besides the more grievous punishment of the next; peradventure they will repent
32|22|Who is more unjust than he who is warned by the signs of his Lord, and then turneth aside from the same? We will surely take vengeance on the wicked
32|23|We heretofore delivered the book of the law unto Moses; wherefore be not thou in doubt as to the revelation thereof: And we ordained the same to be a direction unto the children of Israel
32|24|and we appointed teachers from among them, who should direct the people at our command, when they had persevered with patience, and had firmly believed in our signs
32|25|Verily thy Lord will judge between them, on the day of resurrection, concerning that wherein they have disagreed
32|26|Is it not known unto them how many generations we have destroyed before them, through whose dwellings they walk? Verily herein are signs: Will they not therefore hearken
32|27|Do they not see that We drive rain unto a land bare of grass and parched up, and thereby produce corn, of which their cattle eat, and themselves also? Will they not therefore regard
32|28|The infidels say to the true believers, when will this decision be made between us, if ye speak truth
32|29|Answer, on the day of that decision, the faith of those who shall have disbelieved shall not avail them; neither shall they be respited any longer
32|30|Wherefore avoid them, and expect the issue: Verily they expect to obtain some advantage over thee
33|1|O prophet, fear God, and obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites: Verily God is knowing and wise
33|2|But follow that which is revealed unto thee from thy Lord; for God is well-acquainted with that which ye do
33|3|And put thy trust in God; for God is a sufficient protector
33|4|God hath not given a man two hearts within him; neither hath he made your wives -- some of whom ye divorce, regarding them thereafters as your mothers -- your true mothers; nor hath he made your adopted sons your true sons. This is your saying in your mouths: But God speaketh the truth ; and he directeth the right way
33|5|Call such as are adopted, the sons of their natural fathers: This will be more just in the sight of God. And if ye know not their fathers, let them be as your brethren in religion, and your companions: And it shall be no crime in you, that ye err in this matter; but that shall be criminal which your hearts purposely design; for God is gracious and merciful
33|6|The prophet is nigher unto the true believers than their own souls; and his wives are their mothers. Those who are related by consanguinity are nigher of kin the one of them unto the others, according to the book of God, than the other true believers, and the Mohajerun: Unless that ye do what is fitting and reasonable to your relations in general. This is written in the book of God
33|7|Remember when we accepted their covenant from the prophets, and from thee, O Mohammed, and from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary, and received from them a firm covenant
33|8|that God may examine the speakers of truth concerning their veracity: And He hath prepared a painful torment for the unbelievers
33|9|O true believers, remember the favour of God towards you, when armies of infidels came against you, and We sent against them a wind, and hosts of angels which ye saw not: And God beheld that which ye did
33|10|When they came against you from above you, and from below you, and when your sight became troubled, and your hearts came even to your throats for fear, and ye imagined of God various imaginations
33|11|There were the faithful tried, and made to tremble with a violent trembling
33|12|And when the hypocrites, and those in whose heart was an infirmity, said, God and his apostle have made you no other than a fallacious promise
33|13|And when a party of them said, O inhabitants of Yathreb, there is no place of security for you here; wherefore return home. And a part of them asked leave of the prophet to depart, saying, verily our houses are defenceless and exposed to the enemy: But they were not defenceless; and their intention was no other than to fly
33|14|If the city had been entered upon them by the enemy from the parts adjacent, and they had been asked to desert the true believers, and to fight against them; they had surely consented thereto: But they had not, in such case, remained in the same, but a little while
33|15|They had before made a covenant with God, that they would not turn their backs: And the performance of their covenant with God shall be examined into hereafter
33|16|Say, flight shall not profit you, if ye fly from death or from slaughter: And if it would, yet shall ye not enjoy this world but a little
33|17|Say, who is he who shall defend you against God, if He is pleased to bring evil on you, or is pleased to shew mercy towards you? They shall find none to patronize or protect them, besides God
33|18|God already knoweth those among you who hinder others from following his apostle, and who say unto their brethren, come hither unto us; and who come not to battle, except a little
33|19|being covetous towards you: But when fear cometh on them, thou seest them look unto thee for assistance, their eyes rolling about, like the eyes of him who fainteth by reason of the agonies of death: Yet when their fear is past, they inveigh against you with sharp tongues; being covetous of the best and most valuable part of the spoils. These believe not sincerely; wherefore God hath rendered their works of no avail; and this is easy with God
33|20|They imagined that the confederates would not depart and raise the siege: And if the confederates should come another time, they would wish to live in the deserts among the Arabs who dwell in tents, and there to inquire after news concerning you; and although they were with you this time, yet they fought not, except a little
33|21|Ye have in the apostle of God an excellent example, unto him who hopeth in God, and the last day, and remembereth God frequently
33|22|When the true believers saw the confederates, they said, this is what God and his apostle have foretold us; and God and his apostle have spoken the truth: And it only increased their faith and resignation
33|23|Of the true believers some men justly performed what they had promised unto God; and some of them have finished their course, and some of them wait the same advantage; and they changed not their promise, by deviating therefrom in the least
33|24|That God may reward the just performers of their covenant for their fidelity; and may punish the hypocritical, if He pleaseth, or may be turned unto them; for God is ready to forgive, and merciful
33|25|God hath driven back the infidels in their wrath: They obtained no advantage; and God was a sufficient protector unto the faithful in battle; for God is strong and mighty
33|26|And He hath caused such of those who have received the scriptures, as assisted the confederates, to come down out of their fortresses, and He cast into their hearts terror and dismay: A part of them ye slew, and a part ye made captives
33|27|and God hath caused you to inherit their land, and their houses, and their wealth, and a land on which ye have not trodden; for God is almighty
33|28|O prophet, say unto thy wives, if ye seek this present life, and the pomp thereof, come, I will make a handsome provision for you, and I will dismiss you with an honourable dismission
33|29|But if ye seek God and his apostle, and the life to come, verily God hath prepared for such of you as work righteousness, a great reward
33|30|O wives of the prophet, whosoever of you shall commit a manifest wickedness, the punishment thereof shall be doubled unto her twofold; and this is easy with God
33|31|But whosoever of you shall be obedient unto God and his apostle, and shall do that which is right, We will give her reward twice, and We have prepared for her an honourable provision in paradise
33|32|O wives of the prophet, ye are not as other women: If ye fear God, be not too complaisant in speech, lest he should covet, in whose heart is a disease of incontinence; but speak the speech which is convenient
33|33|And sit still in your houses; and set not out your selves with the ostentation of the former time of ignorance: And observe the appointed times of prayer, and give alms; and obey God, and his apostle; for God desireth only to remove from you the abomination of vanity, since ye are the houshould of the prophet, and to purify you by a perfect purification
33|34|And remember that which is read in your houses, of the signs of God, and of the wisdom revealed in the Koran; for God is clear-sighted, and well-acquainted with your actions
33|35|Verily the Moslems of either sex, and the true believers of either sex, and the devout men, and the devout women, and the men of veracity, and the women of veracity, and the patient men, and the patient women, and the humble men and the humble women, and the alms-givers of either sex, and the men who fast, and the women who fast, and the chaste men, and the chaste women, and those of either sex who remember God frequently; for them hath God prepared forgiveness, and a great reward
33|36|It is not fit for a true believer of either sex, when God and his apostle have decreed a thing, that they should have the liberty of choosing a different matter of their own: And whoever is disobedient unto God and his apostle, surely erreth with a manifest error
33|37|And remember when thou saidst to him unto whom God had been gracious, and on whom thou also hadst conferred favours, keep thy wife to thy self, and fear God: And thou didst conceal that in thy mind which God had determined to discover, and didst fear men; whereas it was more just that thou shouldst fear God. But when Zeid had determined the matter concerning her, and had resolved to divorce her, we joined her in marriage unto thee; lest a crime should be charged on the true believers, in marrying the wives of their adopted sons, when they have determined the matter concerning them: And the command of God is to be performed
33|38|No crime is to be charged on the prophet, as to what God hath allowed him, conformable to the ordinance of God with regard to those who preceded him, -- for the command of God is a determinate decree
33|39|who brought the messages of God, and feared him, and feared none besides God: And God is a sufficient accountant
33|40|Mohammed is not the father of any man among you; but the apostle of God, and the seal of the prophets: And God knoweth all things
33|41|O true believers, remember God with a frequent remembrance
33|42|and celebrate his praise morning and evening
33|43|It is He who is gracious unto you, and his angels intercede for you, that He may lead you forth from darkness into light; and He is merciful towards the true believers
33|44|Their salutation, on the day whereon they shall meet Him, shall be, peace! And He hath prepared for them an honourable recompense
33|45|O prophet, verily We have sent thee to be a witness, and a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats
33|46|and an inviter unto God, through his good pleasure, and a shining light
33|47|Bear good tidings therefore unto the true believers, that they shall receive great abundance from God
33|48|And obey not the unbelievers, and the hypocrites, and mind not their evil treatment: But trust in God; and God is a sufficient protector
33|49|O true believers, when ye marry women who are believers, and afterwards put them away, before ye have touched them, there is no term prescribed you to fulfil towards them after their divorce: But make them a present, and dismiss them freely, with an honourable dismission
33|50|O prophet, We have allowed thee thy wives unto whom thou hast given their dower, and also the slaves which thy right hand possesseth, of the booty which God hath granted thee; and the daughters of thy uncle, and the daughters of thy aunts, both on thy father's side, and on thy mother's side, who have fled with thee from Mecca, and any other believing woman, if she give herself unto the prophet; in case the prophet desireth to take her to wife. This is a peculiar privilege granted unto thee, above the rest of the true believers. We know what we have ordained them concerning their wives, and the slaves whom their right hands possess: Lest it should be deemed a crime in thee to make use of the privilege granted thee; for God is gracious and merciful
33|51|Thou mayest postpone the turn of such of thy wives as thou shalt please, in being called to thy bed; and thou mayest take unto thee her whom thou shalt please, and her whom thou shalt desire of those whom thou shalt have before rejected: And it shall be no crime in thee. This will be more easy, that they may be entirely content, and may not be grieved, but may be well pleased with what thou shalt give every of them: God knoweth whatever is in your hearts; and God is knowing and gracious
33|52|It shall not be lawful for thee to take other women to wife hereafter, nor to exchange any of thy wives for them, although their beauty please thee; except the slaves whom thy right hand shall possess: And God observeth all things
33|53|O true believers, enter not the houses of the prophet, unless it be permitted you to eat meat with him, without waiting his convenient time: But when ye are invited, then enter. And when ye shall have eaten, disperse yourselves; and stay not to enter into familiar discourse: For this incommodeth the prophet. He is ashamed to bid you depart; but God is not ashamed of the truth. And when ye ask of the prophet's wives what ye may have occasion for, ask it of them from behind a curtain. This will be more pure for your hearts and their hearts. Neither is it fit for you to give any uneasiness to the apostle of God, or to marry his wives after him for ever: For this would be a grievous thing in the sight of God
33|54|Whether ye divulge a thing, or conceal it, verily God knoweth all things
33|55|It shall be no crime in them as to their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their women, or the slaves which their right hands possess, if they speak to them unveiled: and fear ye God; for God is witness of all things
33|56|Verily God and his angels bless the prophet: O true believers, do ye also bless him, and salute him with a respectful salutation
33|57|As to those who offend God and his apostle, God shall curse them in this world and in the next; and He hath prepared for them a shameful punishment
33|58|And they who shall injure the true believers of either sex, without their deserving it, shall surely bear the guilt of calumny and a manifest injustice
33|59|O prophet, speak unto thy wives, and thy daughters, and the wives of the true believers, that they cast their outer garments over them when they walk abroad; this will be more proper, that they may be known to be matrons of reputation, and may not be affronted by unseemly words or actions. God is gracious and merciful
33|60|Verily if the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is an infirmity, and they who raise disturbances in Medina, do not desist; we will surely stir thee up against them, to chastise them: Henceforth they shall not be suffered to dwell near thee therein, except for a little time
33|61|and being accursed; wherever they are found they shall be taken, and killed with a general slaughter
33|62|according to the sentence of God concerning those who have been before; and thou shalt not find any change in the sentence of God
33|63|Men will ask thee concerning the approach of the last hour: Answer, verily the knowledge thereof is with God alone; and he will not inform thee: Peradventure the hour is nigh at hand
33|64|Verily God hath cursed the infidels, and hath prepared for them a fierce fire
33|65|wherein they shall remain for ever: They shall find no patron or defender
33|66|On the day whereon their faces shall be rolled in hell fire, they shall say, O that we had obeyed God, and had obeyed his apostle
33|67|And they shall say, O Lord, verily we have obeyed our lords, and our great men; and they have seduced us from the right way
33|68|O Lord, give them the double of our punishment; and curse them with a heavy curse
33|69|O true believers, be not as those who injured Moses; but God cleared him from the scandal which they had spoken concerning him; and he was of great consideration in the sight of God
33|70|O true believers, fear God, and speak words well-directed
33|71|that God may correct your works for you, and may forgive you your sins: And whoever shall obey God and his apostle, shall enjoy great felicity
33|72|We proposed the faith unto the heavens, and the earth, and the mountains: And they refused to undertake the same, and were afraid thereof; but man undertook it: Verily he was unjust to himself, and foolish
33|73|That God may punish the hypocritical men, and the hypocritical women, and the idolaters, and the idolatresses; and that God may be turned unto the true believers, both men and women; for God is gracious and merciful
34|1|Praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth whatever is in the heavens and on earth: And unto Him be praise in the world to come; for He is wise and intelligent
34|2|He knoweth whatsoever entereth into the earth, and whatsoever cometh out of the same, and whatsoever descendeth from heaven, and whatsoever ascendeth thereto: And He is merciful and ready to forgive
34|3|The unbelievers say, the hour of judgment will not come unto us. Answer, yea, by my Lord, it will surely come unto you; it is He who knoweth the hidden secret: The weight of an ant, either in heaven or in earth, is not absent from Him, nor any thing lesser than this or greater, but the same is written in the perspicuous book of his decrees
34|4|that He may recompense those who shall have believed, and wrought righteousness: They shall receive pardon, and an honourable provision
34|5|But they who endeavour to render our signs of none effect, shall receive a punishment of painful torment
34|6|Those unto whom knowledge hath been given, see that the book which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth, and directeth into the glorious and laudable way
34|7|The unbelievers say to one another, shall we shew you a man who shall prophesy unto you, that when ye shall have been dispersed with a total dispersion, ye shall be raised a new creature
34|8|He hath forged a lie concerning God, or rather he is distracted. But they who believe not in the life to come, shall fall into punishment and a wide error
34|9|Have they not therefore considered what is before them, and what is behind them, of the heaven and the earth? If We please, We will cause the earth to open and swallow them up, or will cause a piece of the heaven to fall upon them: Verily herein is a sign unto every servant, who turneth unto God
34|10|We heretofore bestowed on David excellence from Us: And We said, O mountains, sing alternate praises with him; and We obliged the birds also to join therein. And We softened the iron for him
34|11|saying, make thereof complete coats of mail, and rightly dispose the small plates which compose the same: And work ye righteousness, O family of David; for I see that which ye do
34|12|And We made the wind subject unto Solomon: It blew in the morning for a month, and in the evening for a month. And We made a fountain of molten brass to flow for him. And some of the genii were obliged to work in his presence, by the will of his Lord; and whoever of them turned aside from our command, We will cause him to taste the pain of hell fire
34|13|They made for him whatever he pleased, of palaces, and statues, and large dishes like fishponds, and cauldrons standing firm on their trevets; and We said, work righteousness, O family of David, with thanksgiving; for few of my servants are thankful
34|14|And when We had decreed that Solomon should die, nothing discovered his death unto them, except the creeping thing of the earth, which gnawed his staff. And when his body fell down, the genii plainly perceived that if they had known that which is secret, they had not continued in a vile punishment
34|15|The descendants of Saba had heretofore a sign in their dwellings; namely, two gardens, on the right hand and on the left: And it was said unto them, eat ye of the provision of your Lord, and give thanks unto Him; ye have a good country, and a gracious Lord
34|16|But they turned aside from what We had commanded them; wherefore We sent against them the inundation of al Arem, and We changed their two gardens for them into two gardens producing bitter fruit, and tamarisks, and some little fruit of the lote-tree
34|17|This We gave them in reward, because they were ungrateful: Is any thus rewarded except the ungrateful
34|18|And We placed between them and the cities which We have blessed, cities situate near each other; and We made the journey easy between them, saying, travel through the same by night and by day, in security
34|19|But they said, O Lord, put a greater distance between our journeys: And they were unjust unto themselves; and We made them the subject of discourse, and dispersed them with a total dispersion. Verily herein are signs, unto every patient, grateful person
34|20|And Eblis found his opinion of them to be true: And they followed him, except a party of the true believers
34|21|And he had no power over them, unless to tempt them, that We might know him who believed in the life to come, from him who doubted thereof. Thy Lord observeth all things
34|22|Say unto the idolaters, call upon those whom ye imagine to be gods, besides God: They are not masters of the weight of an ant in heaven or on earth, neither have they any share in the creation or government of the same; nor is any of them assistant to him therein
34|23|No intercession will be of service in his presence, except the intercession of him to whom he shall grant permission to intercede for others: And they shall wait in suspense until, when the terror shall be taken off from their hearts, they shall say to one another, what doth your Lord say? They shall answer, that which is just: And He is the high, the great God
34|24|Say, who provideth food for you from heaven and earth? Answer, God: And either we, or ye, follow the true direction, or are in a manifest error
34|25|Say, Ye shall not be examined concerning what we shall have committed: Neither shall we be examined concerning what ye shall have done
34|26|Say, our Lord will assemble us together at the last day: Then will He judge between us with truth; and He is the judge, the knowing
34|27|Say, shew me those whom ye have joined as partners with Him? Nay; rather He is the mighty, the wise God
34|28|We have not sent thee otherwise than unto mankind in general, a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats: But the greater part of men do not understand
34|29|And they say, when will this threat be fulfilled, if ye speak truth
34|30|Answer, a threat is denounced unto you of a day which ye shall not retard one hour, neither shall ye hasten
34|31|The unbelievers say, we will by no means believe in this Koran, nor in that which hath been revealed before it. But if thou couldest see when the unjust doers shall be set before their Lord! They will iterate discourse with one another: Those who were esteemed weak shall say unto those who behaved themselves arrogantly, had it not been for you, verily we had been true believers
34|32|They who behaved themselves arrogantly shall say unto those who were esteemed weak, did we turn you aside from the true direction, after it had come unto you? On the contrary, ye acted wickedly of your own free choice
34|33|And they who were esteemed weak shall say unto those who behaved with arrogance, nay, but the crafty plot which ye devised by night and by day, occasioned our ruin; when ye commanded us that we should not believe in God, and that we should set up other gods as equals unto him. And they shall conceal their repentance, after they shall have seen the punishment prepared for them. And we will put yokes on the necks of those who shall have disbelieved: Shall they be rewarded any otherwise than according to what they shall have wrought
34|34|We have sent no warner unto any city, but the inhabitants thereof who lived in affluence said, verily we believe not that with which ye are sent
34|35|And those of Mecca also say, we abound in riches and children more than ye; and we shall not be punished hereafter
34|36|Answer, verily my Lord will bestow provision in abundance unto whom he pleaseth, and will be sparing unto whom he pleaseth: But the greater part of men know not this
34|37|Neither your riches nor your children are the things which shall cause you to draw nigh unto us with a near approach: Only whoever believeth, and worketh righteousness, they shall receive a double reward for that which they shall have wrought; and they shall dwell in security, in the upper apartments of paradise
34|38|But they who shall endeavour to render our signs of none effect, shall be delivered up to punishment
34|39|Say, verily my Lord will bestow provision in abundance unto whom he pleaseth of his servants, and will be sparing unto whom he pleaseth: And whatever thing ye shall give in alms, he will return it; and he is the best provider of food
34|40|On a certain day he shall gather them all together: Then shall he say unto the angels, did these worship you
34|41|And the angels shall answer, God forbid! Thou art our friend, and not these: But they worshipped devils; the greater part of them believed in them
34|42|On this day the one of you shall not be able either to profit or to hurt the other. And we will say unto those who have acted unjustly, taste ye the pain of hell fire, which ye rejected as a falsehood
34|43|When our evident signs are read unto them, they say of thee, O Mohammed, this is no other than a man, who seeketh to turn you aside from the gods which your fathers worshipped. And they say of the Koran, this is no other than a lie blasphemously forged. And the unbelievers say of the truth, when it is come unto them, this is no other than manifest sorcery
34|44|Yet we have given them no books of scripture wherein to exercise themselves, nor have we sent unto them any warner before thee
34|45|They who were before them in like manner accused their prophets of imposture: But these have not arrived unto the tenth part of the riches and strength which we had bestowed on the former: And they accused my apostles of imposture; and how severe was my vengeance
34|46|Say, verily I advise you unto one thing, namely, that ye stand before God by two and two, and singly; and then consider seriously, and you will find that there is no madness in your companion Mohammed: He is no other than a warner unto you, sent before a severe punishment
34|47|Say, I ask not of you any reward for my preaching; it is your own, either to give or not: My reward is to be expected from God alone; and he is witness over all things
34|48|Say, verily my Lord sendeth down the truth to his prophets: He is the knower of secrets
34|49|Say, truth is come, and falsehood is vanished, and shall not return any more
34|50|Say, if I err, verily I shall err only against my own soul; But if I be rightly directed, it will be by that which my Lord revealeth unto me; for he is ready to hear, and nigh unto those who call upon him
34|51|If thou couldst see, when the unbelievers shall tremble, and shall find no refuge, and shall be taken from a near place
34|52|and shall say, we believe in him! But how shall they receive the faith from a distant place
34|53|Since they had before denied him, and reviled the mysteries of faith, from a distant place
34|54|And a bar shall be placed between them and that which they shall desire; as it hath been done with those who behaved like them heretofore: Because they have been in a doubt which hath caused scandal
35|1|Praise be unto God, the creator of heaven and earth; who maketh the angels his messengers, furnished with two, and three, and four pair of wings: God maketh what addition He pleaseth unto his creatures; for God is almighty
35|2|The mercy which God shall freely bestow on mankind, there is none who can with-hold; and what He shall with-hold, there is none who can bestow, besides Him: And He is the mighty, the wise
35|3|O men, remember the favour of God towards you: Is there any creator, besides God, who provideth food for you from heaven and earth? There is no God but He: How therefore are ye turned aside from acknowledging his unity
35|4|If they accuse thee of imposture, apostles before thee have also been accused of imposture: And unto God shall all things return
35|5|O men, verily the promise of God is true: Let not therefore the present life deceive you, neither let the deceiver deceive you concerning God
35|6|For Satan is an enemy unto you; wherefore hold him for an enemy: He only inviteth his confederates to be the inhabitants of hell
35|7|For those who believe not there is prepared a severe torment: But for those who shall believe and do that which is right, is prepared mercy and a great reward
35|8|Shall he therefore for whom his evil work hath been prepared, and who imagineth it to be good, be as he who is rightly disposed, and discerneth the truth? Verily God will cause to err whom He pleaseth, and will direct whom He pleaseth. Let not thy soul therefore be spent in sighs for their sakes, on account of their obstinacy; for God well knoweth that which they do
35|9|It is God who sendeth the winds, and raiseth a cloud; and We drive the same unto a dead country, and thereby quicken the earth after it hath been dead: So shall the resurrection be
35|10|Whoever desireth excellence; unto God doth all excellence belong: Unto Him ascendeth the good speech; and the righteous work will He exalt. But as for them who devise wicked plots, they shall suffer a severe punishment; and the device of those men shall be rendered vain
35|11|God created you first of the dust, and afterwards of seed: And He hath made you man and wife. No female conceiveth, or bringeth forth, but with his knowledge. Nor is any thing added unto the age of him whose life is prolonged, neither is any thing diminished from his age, but the same is written in the book of God's decrees. Verily this is easy with God
35|12|The two seas are not to be held in comparison: This is fresh and sweet, pleasant to drink; but that is salt and bitter: Yet out of each of them ye eat fish, and take ornaments for you to wear. Thou seest the ships also plowing the waves thereof, that ye may seek to enrich yourselves by commerce, of the abundance of God: Peradventure ye will be thankful
35|13|He causeth the night to succeed the day, and He causeth the day to succeed the night; and He obligeth the sun and the moon to perform their services: Each of them runneth an appointed course. This is God, your Lord: His is the kingdom. But the idols which ye invoke besides Him, have not the power even over the skin of a date-stone
35|14|If ye invoke them, they will not hear your calling; and although they should hear, yet they would not answer you. On the day of resurrection they shall disclaim your having associated them with God: And none shall declare unto thee the truth, like one who is well-acquainted therewith
35|15|O men, ye have need of God; but God is self-sufficient, and to be praised
35|16|If he pleaseth, he can take you away, and produce a new creature in your stead
35|17|Neither will this be difficult with God
35|18|A burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another: And if a heavy-burdened soul call on another to bear part of its burden, no part thereof shall be born by the person who shall be called on, although he be ever so nearly related. Thou shalt admonish those who fear their Lord in secret, and are constant at prayer: And whoever cleanseth himself from the guilt of disobedience cleanseth himself to the advantage of his own soul; for all shall be assembled before God at the last day
35|19|The blind and the seeing shall not be held equal
35|20|neither darkness and light
35|21|nor the cool shade and the scorching wind
35|22|Neither shall the living and the dead be held equal. God shall cause him to hear whom He pleaseth: But thou shalt not make those to hear who are in their graves
35|23|Thou art no other than a preacher
35|24|Verily We have sent thee with truth, a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats. There hath been no nation, but a preacher hath in past times been conversant among them
35|25|If they charge thee with imposture, they who were before them likewise charged their apostles with imposture. Their apostles came unto them with evident miracles, and with divine writings, and with the enlightening book
35|26|Afterwards I chastised those who were unbelievers; and how severe was my vengeance
35|27|Dost thou not see that God sendeth down rain from heaven; and that We thereby produce fruits of various colours? In the mountains also there are some tracks white and red, of various colours; and others are of a deep black
35|28|And of men, and beasts, and cattle there are whose colours are in like manner various. Such only of his servants fear God, as are indued with understanding: Verily God is mighty, and ready to forgive
35|29|Verily they who read the book of God, and are constant at prayer, and give alms out of what We have bestowed on them, both in secret and openly, hope for a merchandize which shall not perish
35|30|That God may fully pay them their wages, and make them a superabundant addition of his liberality; for He is ready to forgive the faults of his servants, and to requite their endeavours
35|31|That which We have revealed unto thee of the book of the Koran, is the truth, confirming the scriptures which were revealed before it: For God knoweth and regardeth his servants
35|32|And We have given the book of the Koran in heritage unto such of our servants as We have chosen: Of them there is one who injureth his own soul; and there is another of them who keepeth the middle way; and there is another of them who out-strippeth others in good works, by the permission of God. This is the great excellence
35|33|They shall be introduced into gardens of perpetual abode; they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their cloathing therein shall be of silk
35|34|And they shall say, praise be unto God, who hath taken away sorrow from us! Verily our Lord is ready to forgive the sinners, and to reward the obedient
35|35|Who hath caused us to take up our rest in a dwelling of eternal stability, through his bounty, wherein no labour shall touch us, neither shall any weariness affect us
35|36|But for the unbelievers is prepared the fire of hell: It shall not be decreed them to die a second time; neither shall any part of the punishment thereof be made lighter unto them. Thus shall every infidel be rewarded
35|37|And they shall cry out aloud in hell, saying, Lord, take us hence, and we will work righteousness, and not what we have formerly wrought. But it shall be answered them, did we not grant you lives of length sufficient, that whoever would be warned might be warned therein; and did not the preacher come unto you? Taste therefore the pains of hell. And the unjust shall have no protector
35|38|Verily God knoweth the secrets both of heaven and earth, for He knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
35|39|It is He who hath made you to succeed in the earth. Whoever shall disbelieve, on him be his unbelief: And their unbelief shall only gain the unbelievers greater indignation in the sight of their Lord; and their unbelief shall only increase the perdition of the unbelievers
35|40|Say, what think ye of your deities which ye invoke besides God? Shew me what part of the earth they have created. Or had they any share in the creation of the heavens? Have We given unto the idolaters any book of revelations, so that they may rely on any proof therefrom to authorize their practice? Nay: But the ungodly make unto one another only deceitful promises
35|41|Verily God sustaineth the heavens and the earth, lest they fail: And if they should fail, none could support the same besides Him; He is gracious and merciful
35|42|The Koreish swore by God, with a most solemn oath, that if a preacher had come unto them, they would surely have been more willingly directed than any nation: But now a preacher is come unto them, it hath only increased in them their aversion from the truth
35|43|their arrogance in the earth, and their contriving of evil; but the contrivance of evil shall only encompass the authors thereof. Do they expect any other than the punishment awarded against the unbelievers of former times? For thou shalt not find any change in the ordinance of God; neither shalt thou find any variation in the ordinance of God
35|44|Have they not gone through the earth, and seen what hath been the end of those who were before them; although they were more mighty in strength than they? God is not to be frustrated by any thing either in heaven or on earth; for He is wise and powerful
35|45|If God should punish men according to what they deserve, He would not leave on the back of the earth so much as a beast: But He respiteth them to a determined time; and when their time shall come, verily God will regard his servants
36|1|S
36|2|I swear by the instructive Koran
36|3|that thou art one of the messengers of God
36|4|sent to shew the right way
36|5|This is a revelation of the most mighty, the merciful God
36|6|That thou mayest warn a people whose fathers were not warned, and who live in negligence
36|7|Our sentence hath justly been pronounced against the greater part of them; wherefore they shall not believe
36|8|We have put yokes on their necks, which come up to their chins; and they are forced to hold up their heads
36|9|And We have set a bar before them, and a bar behind them; and We have covered them with darkness; wherefore they shall not see
36|10|It shall be equal unto them whether thou preach unto them, or do not preach unto them; they shall not believe
36|11|But thou shalt preach with effect unto him only who followeth the admonition of the Koran, and feareth the Merciful in secret. Wherefore bear good tidings unto him, of mercy, and an honourable reward
36|12|Verily We will restore the dead to life, and will write down their works which they shall have sent before them, and their footsteps which they shall have left behind them; and every thing do We set down in a plain register
36|13|Propound unto them as an example the inhabitants of the city of Antioch, when the apostles of Jesus came thereto
36|14|When We sent unto them two of the said apostles; but they charged them with imposture. Wherefore We strengthened them with a third. And they said, verily we are sent unto you by God
36|15|The inhabitants answered, ye are no other than men, as we are; neither hath the Merciful revealed any thing unto you: Ye only publish a lie
36|16|The apostles replied, our Lord knoweth that we are really sent unto you
36|17|And our duty is only public preaching
36|18|Those of Antioch said, verily we presage evil from you: If ye desist not from preaching, we will surely stone you, and a painful punishment shall be inflicted on you by us
36|19|The apostles answered, your evil presage is with yourselves: Although ye be warned, will ye persist in your errors? Verily ye are a people who transgress exceedingly
36|20|And a certain man came hastily from the farther parts of the city, and said, O my people, follow the messengers of God
36|21|follow him who demandeth not any reward of you: for these are rightly directed
36|22|What reason have I that I should not worship Him who hath created me? For unto Him shall ye return
36|23|Shall I take other gods besides Him? If the Merciful be pleased to afflict me, their intercession will not avail me at all, neither can they deliver me
36|24|Then should I be in a manifest error
36|25|Verily I believe in your Lord; wherefore hearken unto me
36|26|But they stoned him: And as he died, it was said unto him, enter thou into paradise. And he said, O that my people knew
36|27|how merciful God hath been unto me! for he hath highly honoured me
36|28|And we sent not down against his people, after they had slain him, an army from heaven, nor the other instruments of destruction which we sent down on unbelievers in former days
36|29|There was only one cry of Gabriel from heaven, and behold, they became utterly extinct
36|30|O the misery of men! No apostle cometh unto them, but they laugh him to scorn
36|31|Do they not consider how many generations we have destroyed before them? Verily they shall not return unto them
36|32|But all of them in general shall be assembled before us
36|33|One sign of the resurrection unto them is the dead earth: We quicken the same by the rain, and produce thereout various sorts of grain, of which they eat
36|34|And We make therein gardens of palm-trees, and vines; and We cause springs to gush forth in the same
36|35|That they may eat of the fruits thereof, and of the labour of their hands. Will they not therefore give thanks
36|36|Praise be unto Him who hath created all the different kinds, both of vegetables, which the earth bringeth forth, and of their own species, by forming the two sexes, and also the various sorts of things which they know not
36|37|The night also is a sign unto them: We withdraw the day from the same, and behold, they are covered with darkness
36|38|And the sun hasteneth to his place of rest. This is the disposition of the mighty, the wise God
36|39|And for the moon have We appointed certain mansions, until she change and return to be like the old branch of a palm-tree
36|40|It is not expedient that the sun should overtake the moon in her course; neither doth the night outstrip the day: But each of these luminaries moveth in a peculiar orbit
36|41|It is a sign also unto them, that We carry their offspring in the ship filled with merchandize
36|42|and that We have made for them other conveniencies like unto it, whereon they ride
36|43|If we please, We drown them, and there is none to help them; neither are they delivered
36|44|unless through our mercy, and that they may enjoy life for a season
36|45|When it is said unto them, fear that which is before you, and that which is behind you, that ye may obtain mercy; they withdraw from thee
36|46|And thou dost not bring them one sign, of the signs of their Lord, but they turn aside from the same
36|47|And when it is said unto them, give alms of that which God hath bestowed on you; the unbelievers say unto those who believe, by way of mockery, shall we feed him whom God can feed, if he pleaseth? Verily ye are in no other than a manifest error
36|48|And they say, when will this promise of the resurrection be fulfilled, if ye speak truth
36|49|They only wait for one sounding of the trumpet, which shall overtake them while they are disputing together
36|50|and they shall not have time to make any disposition of their effects, neither shall they return to their family
36|51|And the trumpet shall be sounded again; and behold they shall come forth from their graves, and hasten unto their Lord
36|52|They shall say, alas for us! Who hath awakened us from our bed? This is what the Merciful promised us; and his apostles spoke the truth
36|53|It shall be but one sound of the trumpet, and behold, they shall be all assembled before us
36|54|On this day no soul shall be unjustly treated in the least; neither shall ye be rewarded, but according to what ye shall have wrought
36|55|On this day the inhabitants of paradise shall be wholly taken up with joy
36|56|They and their wives shall rest in shady groves, leaning on magnificent couches
36|57|There shall they have fruit, and they shall obtain whatever they shall desire
36|58|Peace shall be the word spoken unto the righteous, by a merciful Lord
36|59|But He shall say unto the wicked, be ye separated this day, O ye wicked, from the righteous
36|60|Did I not command you, O sons of Adam, that ye should not worship Satan; because he was an open enemy unto you
36|61|And did I not say, worship Me; this is the right way
36|62|But now hath he seduced a great multitude of you: Did ye not therefore understand
36|63|This is hell, with which ye were threatened
36|64|Be ye cast into the same this day, to be burned; for that ye have been unbelievers
36|65|On this day We will seal up their mouths, that they shall not open them in their own defence; and their hands shall speak unto Us, and their feet shall bear witness of that which they have committed
36|66|If We pleased We could put out their eyes, and they might run with emulation in the way they use to take; and how should they see their error
36|67|And if We pleased We could transform them into other shapes, in their places where they should be found; and they should not be able to depart: Neither should they repent
36|68|Unto whomsoever We grant a long life, him do We cause to bow down his body through age. Will they not therefore understand
36|69|We have not taught Mohammed the art of poetry; nor is it expedient for him to be a poet. This book is no other than an admonition from God, and a perspicuous Koran
36|70|that he may warn him who is living: And the sentence of condemnation will be justly executed on the unbelievers
36|71|Do they not consider that We have created for them, among the things which our hands have wrought, cattle of several kinds, of which they are possessors
36|72|and that We have put the same in subjection under them? Some of them are for their riding; and on some of them do they feed
36|73|And they receive other advantages therefrom; and of their milk do they drink. Will they not, therefore, be thankful
36|74|They have taken other gods, besides God, in hopes that they may be assisted by them
36|75|but they are not able to give them any assistance: Yet are they a party of troops ready to defend them
36|76|Let not their speech, therefore, grieve thee: We know that which they privately conceal, and that which they publicly discover
36|77|Doth not man know that We have created him of seed? Yet behold, he is an open disputer against the resurrection
36|78|and he propoundeth unto us a comparison, and forgetteth his creation. He saith, who shall restore bones to life, when they are rotten
36|79|Answer, He shall restore them to life, Who produced them the first time: For He is skilled in every kind of creation
36|80|Who giveth you fire out of the green tree, and behold, ye kindle your fuel from thence
36|81|Is not He who hath created the heavens and the earth, able to create new creatures like unto them? Yea certainly: For He is the wise creator
36|82|His command, when He willeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it, be; and it is
36|83|Wherefore praise be unto Him, in whose hand is the kingdom of all things, and unto Whom ye shall return at the last day
37|1|By the angels, who rank themselves in order
37|2|and by those who drive forward and dispel the clouds
37|3|and by those who read the Koran for an admonition
37|4|verily your God is one
37|5|The Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them, and the Lord of the east
37|6|We have adorned the lower heaven with the ornament of the stars
37|7|And We have placed therein a guard, against every rebellious devil
37|8|that they may not listen to the discourse of the exalted princes, -- for they are darted at from every side
37|9|to repel them, and a lasting torment is prepared for them
37|10|except him who catcheth a word by stealth, and is pursued by a shining flame
37|11|Ask the Meccans therefore, whether they be stronger by nature, or the angels whom We have created? We have surely created them of stiff clay
37|12|Thou wondrest at God's power and their obstinacy; but they mock at the arguments urged to convince them
37|13|When they are warned, they do not take warning
37|14|and when they see any sign, they scoff thereat
37|15|and say, this is no other than manifest sorcery
37|16|After we shall be dead, and become dust and bones, shall we really be raised to life
37|17|and our fore-fathers also
37|18|Answer, yea: And ye shall then be despicable
37|19|There shall be but one blast of the trumpet, and they shall see themselves raised
37|20|And they shall say, alas for us! This is the day of judgment
37|21|this is the day of distinction between the righteous and the wicked, which ye rejected as a falsehood
37|22|Gather together those who have acted unjustly, and their comrades, and the idols which they worshipped
37|23|besides God, and direct them in the way to hell
37|24|And set them before God's tribunal; for they shall be called to account
37|25|What aileth you that ye defend not one another
37|26|But on this day they shall submit themselves to the judgment of God
37|27|And they shall draw nigh unto one another, and shall dispute among themselves
37|28|And the seduced shall say unto those who seduced them, verily ye came unto us with presages of prosperity
37|29|and the seducers shall answer, nay, rather ye were not true believers
37|30|For we had no power over you to compel you; but ye were people who voluntarily transgressed
37|31|Wherefore the sentence of our Lord hath been justly pronounced against us, and we shall surely taste his vengeance
37|32|We seduced you; but we also erred ourselves
37|33|They shall both thereof be made partakers of the same punishment on that day
37|34|Thus will We deal with the wicked
37|35|Because when it is said unto them, there is no god besides the true God, they swell with arrogance
37|36|and say, shall we abandon our gods for a distracted poet
37|37|Nay; he cometh with the truth, and beareth witness to the former apostles
37|38|Ye shall surely taste the painful torment of hell
37|39|and ye shall not be rewarded, but according to your works
37|40|But as for the sincere servants of God
37|41|they shall have a certain provision in paradise
37|42|namely, delicious fruits: And they shall be honoured
37|43|They shall be placed in gardens of pleasure
37|44|leaning on couches, opposite to one another
37|45|A cup shall be carried round unto them, filled from a limpid fountain
37|46|for the delight of those who drink
37|47|It shall not oppress the understanding, neither shall they be inebriated therewith
37|48|And near them shall lie the virgins of paradise, refraining their looks from beholding any besides their spouses, having large black eyes
37|49|and resembling the eggs of an ostrich covered with feathers from the dust
37|50|And they shall turn the one unto the other, and shall ask one another questions
37|51|And one of them shall say, verily I had an intimate friend while I lived in the world
37|52|who said unto me, art thou one of those who assertest the truth of the resurrection
37|53|After we shall be dead, and reduced to dust and bones, shall we surely be judged
37|54|Then he shall say to his companions, will ye look down
37|55|And he shall look down, and shall see him in the midst of hell
37|56|And he shall say unto him, by God, it wanted little but thou hadst drawn me into ruin
37|57|and had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I had surely been one of those who have been delivered up to eternal torment
37|58|Shall we die any other
37|59|than our first death; or do we suffer any punishment
37|60|Verily this is great felicity
37|61|For the obtaining a felicity like this let the labourers labour
37|62|Is this a better entertainment, or the tree of Al Zakkum
37|63|Verily We have designed the same for an occasion of dispute unto the unjust
37|64|It is a tree which issueth from the bottom of hell
37|65|The fruit thereof resembleth the heads of devils
37|66|and the damned shall eat of the same, and shall fill their bellies therewith
37|67|and there shall be given them thereon a mixture of filthy and boiling water to drink
37|68|Afterwards shall they return into hell
37|69|They found their fathers going astray
37|70|and they trod hastily in their footsteps
37|71|For the greater part of the ancients erred before them
37|72|And We sent warners unto them heretofore
37|73|And see how miserable was the end of those who were warned
37|74|except the sincere servants of God
37|75|Noah called on Us in former days, and We heard him graciously
37|76|And We delivered him and his family out of the great distress
37|77|and We caused his off-spring to be those who survived to people the earth
37|78|And We left the following salutation to be bestowed on him by the latest posterity
37|79|namely, peace be on Noah among all creatures
37|80|Thus do We reward the righteous
37|81|for he was one of our servants the true believers
37|82|Afterwards We drowned the others
37|83|Abraham also was of his religion
37|84|When he came unto his Lord with a perfect heart
37|85|When he said unto his father and his people, what do ye worship
37|86|Do ye choose false gods preferably to the true God
37|87|What therefore is your opinion of the Lord of all creatures
37|88|And he looked and observed the stars
37|89|and said, verily I shall be sick, and shall not assist at your sacrifices
37|90|And they turned their backs and departed from him
37|91|And Abraham went privately to their gods, and said scoffingly unto them, do ye not eat of the meat which is set before you
37|92|What aileth you that ye speak not
37|93|And he turned upon them, and struck them with his right hand, and demolished them
37|94|And the people came hastily unto him
37|95|And he said, do ye worship the images which ye carve
37|96|Whereas God hath created you, and also that which ye make
37|97|They said, build a pile for him, and cast him into the glowing fire
37|98|And they devised a plot against him; but We made them the inferior, and delivered him
37|99|And Abraham said, verily I am going unto my Lord, who will direct me
37|100|O Lord, grant me a righteous issue
37|101|Wherefore We acquainted him that he should have a son, who should be a meek youth
37|102|And when he had attained to years of discretion, and could join in acts of religion with him; Abraham said unto him, O my son, verily I saw in a dream that I should offer thee in sacrifice: Consider therefore what thou art of opinion I should do. He answered, O my father, do what thou art commanded: Thou shalt find me, if God please, a patient person
37|103|And when they had submitted themselves to the divine will, and Abraham had laid his son prostrate on his face
37|104|We cried unto him, O Abraham
37|105|now hast thou verified the vision. Thus do We reward the righteous
37|106|Verily this was a manifest trial
37|107|And We ransomed him with a noble victim
37|108|And We left the following salutation to be bestowed on him by the latest posterity
37|109|namely, peace be on Abraham
37|110|Thus do We reward the righteous
37|111|For he was one of our faithful servants
37|112|And We rejoiced him with the promise of Isaac, a righteous prophet
37|113|and We blessed him and Isaac: And of their off-spring were some righteous doers, and others who manifestly injured their own souls
37|114|We were also gracious unto Moses and Aaron, heretofore
37|115|And We delivered them and their people from a great distress
37|116|And We assisted them against the Egyptians, and they became the conquerors
37|117|And We gave them the perspicuous book of the law
37|118|and We directed them into the right way
37|119|And We left the following salutation to be bestowed on them by the latest posterity
37|120|namely, peace be on Moses and Aaron
37|121|Thus do We reward the righteous
37|122|for they were two of our faithful servants
37|123|And Elias was also one of those who were sent by Us
37|124|When he said unto his people, do ye not fear God
37|125|Do ye invoke Baal, and forsake the most excellent creator
37|126|God is your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers
37|127|But they accused him of imposture: Wherefore they shall be delivered up to eternal punishment
37|128|except the sincere servants of God
37|129|And We left the following salutation to be bestowed on him by the latest posterity
37|130|namely, peace be on Ilyasin
37|131|Thus do We reward the righteous
37|132|For he was one of our faithful servants
37|133|And Lot was also one of those who were sent by Us
37|134|When We delivered him and his whole family
37|135|except an old woman, his wife, who perished among those that remained behind
37|136|Afterwards We destroyed the others
37|137|And ye, O people of Mecca, pass by the places where they once dwelt, as ye journey in the morning
37|138|and by night: Will ye not therefore understand
37|139|Jonas was also one of those who were sent by Us
37|140|When he fled into the loaded ship
37|141|and those who were on board cast lots among themselves, and he was condemned
37|142|And the fish swallowed him; for he was worthy of reprehension
37|143|And if he had not been one of those who praised God
37|144|verily he had remained in the belly thereof until the day of resurrection
37|145|And We cast him on the naked shore, and he was sick
37|146|And We caused a plant of a gourd to grow up over him
37|147|and We sent him to an hundred thousand persons, or they were a greater number
37|148|and they believed: Wherefore We granted them to enjoy this life, for a season
37|149|Inquire of the Meccans whether thy Lord hath daughters, and they sons
37|150|Have We created the angels of the female sex? And were they witnesses thereof
37|151|Do they not say of their own false invention
37|152|God hath begotten issue? And are they not really liars
37|153|Hath he chosen daughters preferably to sons
37|154|Ye have no reason to judge thus
37|155|Will ye not therefore be admonished
37|156|Or have ye a manifest proof of what ye say
37|157|Produce now your book of revelations, if ye speak truth
37|158|And they make Him to be of kin unto the genii; whereas the genii know that they who affirm such things, shall be delivered up to eternal punishment
37|159|far be that from God, which they affirm of him
37|160|Except the sincere servants of God
37|161|Moreover ye and that which ye worship
37|162|shall not seduce any concerning God
37|163|except him who is destined to be burned in hell
37|164|There is none of us, but hath an appointed place
37|165|We range ourselves in order, attending the commands of God
37|166|and we celebrate the divine praise
37|167|The infidels said
37|168|if we had been favoured with a book of divine revelations, of those which were delivered to the ancients
37|169|we had surely been sincere servants of God
37|170|Yet now the Koran is revealed, they believe not therein; but hereafter shall they know the consequence of their unbelief
37|171|Our word hath formerly been given unto our servants the apostles
37|172|that they should certainly be assisted against the infidels
37|173|and that our armies should surely be the conquerors
37|174|Turn aside therefore from them, for a season
37|175|And see the calamities which shall afflict them; for they shall see thy future success and prosperity
37|176|Do they therefore seek to hasten our vengeance
37|177|Verily when it shall descend into their courts, an evil morning shall it be unto those who were warned in vain
37|178|Turn aside from them therefore for a season
37|179|and see: Hereafter shall they see thy success and their punishment
37|180|Praise be unto thy Lord, the Lord who is far exalted above what they affirm of Him
37|181|And peace be on his apostles
37|182|And praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
38|1|By the Koran full of admonition
38|2|Verily the unbelievers are addicted to pride and contention
38|3|How many generations have We destroyed before them; and they cried for mercy, but it was not a time to escape
38|4|They wonder that a warner from among themselves hath come unto them. And the unbelievers said, this man is a sorcerer, and a liar
38|5|Doth he affirm the gods to be but one God? Surely this is a wonderful thing
38|6|And the chief men among them departed, saying to one another, go, and persevere in the worship of your gods: Verily this is the thing which is designed
38|7|We have not heard any thing like this in the last religion: This is no other than a false contrivance
38|8|Hath an admonition been sent unto him preferably to any other among us? Verily they are in a doubt concerning my admonition: But they have not yet tasted my vengeance
38|9|Are the treasuries of the mercy of thy Lord, the mighty, the munificent God, in their hands
38|10|Is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and of whatever is between them, in their possession? If it be so, let them ascend by steps unto heaven
38|11|But any army of the confederates shall even here be put to flight
38|12|The people of Noah, and the tribe of Ad, and Pharaoh the contriver of the stakes
38|13|and the tribe of Thamud, and the people of Lot, and the inhabitants of the wood near Madian, accused the prophets of imposture before them: These were the confederates against the messengers of God
38|14|All of them did no other than accuse their apostles of falsehood: Wherefore my vengeance hath been justly executed upon them
38|15|And these wait only for one sounding of the trumpet; which there shall be no deferring
38|16|And they scoffingly say, O Lord, hasten our sentence unto us, before the day of account
38|17|Do thou patiently bear that which they utter: And remind them of our servant David, indued with strength; for he was one who seriously turned himself unto God
38|18|We compelled the mountains to celebrate our praise with him, in the evening and at sun-rise
38|19|and also the birds, which gathered themselves together unto him: All of them returned frequently unto him for this purpose
38|20|And We established his kingdom, and gave him wisdom and eloquence of speech
38|21|Hath the story of the two adversaries come to thy knowledge; when they ascended over the wall into the upper apartment
38|22|when they went in unto David, and he was afraid of them. They said, Fear not: We are two adversaries who have a controversy to be decided. The one of us hath wronged the other: Wherefore judge between us with truth, and be not unjust; and direct us into the even way
38|23|This my brother had ninety and nine sheep; and I had only one ewe: And he said, give her me to keep; and he prevailed against me in the discourse which we had together
38|24|David answered, verily he hath wronged thee, in demanding thine ewe as an addition to his own sheep: And many of them who are concerned together in business, wrong one another, except those who believe and do that which is right; but how few are they! And David perceived that We had tried him by this parable, and he asked pardon of his Lord: And he fell down and bowed himself, and repented
38|25|Wherefore We forgave him this fault; and he shall be admitted to approach near unto us, and shall have an excellent place of abode in paradise
38|26|O David, verily We have appointed thee a sovereign prince in the earth: Judge therefore between men with truth; and follow not thy own lust, lest it cause thee to err from the way of God: For those who err from the way of God, shall suffer a severe punishment, because they have forgotten the day of account
38|27|We have not created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, in vain. This is the opinion of the unbelievers: But woe unto those who believe not, because of the fire of hell
38|28|Shall We deal with those who believe and do good works, as with those who act corruptly in the earth? Shall We deal with the pious as with the wicked
38|29|A blessed book have We sent down unto thee, O Mohammed, that they may attentively meditate on the signs thereof, and that men of understanding may be warned
38|30|And We gave unto David Solomon; how excellent a servant! For he frequently turned himself unto God
38|31|When the horses standing on three feet, and touching the ground with the edge of the fourth foot, and swift in the course, were set in parade before him in the evening
38|32|he said, verily I have loved the love of earthly good above the remembrance of my Lord; and have spent the time in viewing these horses, until the sun is hidden by the vail of night
38|33|Bring the horses back unto me. And when they were brought back, he began to cut off their legs and their necks
38|34|We also tried Solomon, and placed on his throne a counterfeit body: Afterwards he turned unto God
38|35|and said, O Lord, forgive me, and give me a kingdom which may not be obtained by any after me; for thou art the giver of kingdoms
38|36|And We made the wind subject to him; it ran gently at his command, whithersoever he directed
38|37|And We also put the devils in subjection under him; and among them such as were every way skilled in building, and in diving for pearls
38|38|And others We delivered to him bound in chains
38|39|saying, this is our gift: Therefore be bounteous, or be sparing unto whom thou shalt think fit, without rendering an account
38|40|And he shall approach near unto Us, and shall have an excellent abode in paradise
38|41|And remember our servant Job; when he cried unto his Lord, saying, verily Satan hath afflicted me with calamity and pain
38|42|And it was said unto him, strike the earth with thy foot; which when he had done, a fountain sprang up, and it was said to him, this is for thee to wash in, to refresh thee, and to drink
38|43|And We restored unto him his family, and as many more with them, through our mercy; and for an admonition unto those who are indued with understanding
38|44|And We said unto him, take a handful of rods in thy hand, and strike thy wife therewith; and break not thine oath. Verily We found him a patient person: How excellent a servant was he! For he was one who frequently turned himself unto Us
38|45|Remember also our servants Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, who were men strenuous and prudent
38|46|Verily We purified them with a perfect purification, through the remembrance of the life to come
38|47|and they were, in our sight, elect and good men
38|48|And remember Ismael, and Elisha, and Dhu'lkefl: For all these were good men
38|49|This is an admonition. Verily the pious shall have an excellent place to return unto
38|50|namely, gardens of perpetual abode, the gates whereof shall stand open unto them
38|51|As they lie down therein, they shall there ask for many sorts of fruits, and for drink
38|52|and near them shall sit the virgins of paradise, refraining their looks from beholding any besides their spouses, and of equal age with them
38|53|This is what ye are promised, at the day of account
38|54|This is our provision; which shall not fail
38|55|This shall be the reward of the righteous. But for the transgressors is prepared an evil receptacle
38|56|namely, hell: They shall be cast into the same to be burned, and a wretched couch shall it be
38|57|This let them taste, to wit, scalding water, and corruption flowing from the bodies of the damned
38|58|and divers other things of the same kind
38|59|And it shall be said to the seducers, this troop which was guided by you, shall be thrown, together with you, headlong into hell: They shall not be bidden welcome; for they shall enter the fire to be burned
38|60|And the seduced shall say to their seducers, verily ye shall not be bidden welcome: Ye have brought it upon us; and a wretched abode is hell
38|61|They shall say, O Lord, doubly increase the torment of him who hath brought this punishment upon us, in the fire of hell
38|62|And the infidels shall say, why do we not see the men whom we numbered among the wicked
38|63|and whom we received with scorn? Or do our eyes miss them
38|64|Verily this is a truth; to wit, the disputing of the inhabitants of hell fire
38|65|Say, O Mohammed, unto the idolaters, verily I am no other than a warner: And there is no god, except the one only God, the Almighty
38|66|the Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatsoever is between them; the mighty, the forgiver of sins
38|67|Say, it is a weighty message
38|68|from which ye turn aside
38|69|I had no knowledge of the exalted princes, when they disputed concerning the creation of man
38|70|it hath been revealed unto me only as a proof that I am a public preacher
38|71|When thy Lord said unto the angels, verily I am about to create man of clay
38|72|When I shall have formed him, therefore, and shall have breathed my spirit into him, do ye fall down and worship him
38|73|And all the angels worshipped him, in general
38|74|except Eblis, who was puffed up with pride, and became an unbeliever
38|75|God said unto him, O Eblis, what hindreth thee from worshipping that which I have created with my hands? Art thou elated with vain pride? Or art thou really one of exalted merit
38|76|He answered, I am more excellent than he: Thou hast created me of fire, and hast created him of clay
38|77|God said unto him, get thee hence therefore, for thou shalt be driven away from mercy
38|78|And my curse shall be upon thee, until the day of judgment
38|79|He replied, O Lord, respite me, therefore, until the day of resurrection
38|80|God said, verily thou shalt be one of those who are respited
38|81|until the day of the determined time
38|82|Eblis said, by thy might do I swear, I will surely seduce them all
38|83|except thy servants who shall be peculiarly chosen from among them
38|84|God said, it is a just sentence; and I speak the truth
38|85|I will surely fill hell with thee, and with such of them as shall follow thee, altogether
38|86|Say unto the Meccans, I ask not of you any reward for this my preaching: Neither am I one of those who assume a part which belongs not to them
38|87|The Koran is no other than an admonition unto all creatures
38|88|And ye shall surely know what is delivered therein to be true, after a season
39|1|The revelation of this book is from the mighty, the wise God
39|2|Verily We have revealed this book unto thee with truth: Wherefore serve God, exhibiting the pure religion unto Him
39|3|Ought not the pure religion to be exhibited unto God? But as to those who take other patrons besides Him, saying, we worship them only that they may bring us nearer unto God; verily God will judge between them concerning that wherein they disagree. Surely God will not direct him who is a liar, or ungrateful
39|4|If God had been minded to have had a son, He had surely chosen what He pleased out of that which He hath created. But far be such a thing from Him! He is the sole, the almighty God
39|5|He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth: He causeth the night to succeed the day, and He causeth the day to succeed the night, and He obligeth the sun and the moon to perform their services; each of them hasteneth to an appointed period. Is not He the mighty, the forgiver of sins
39|6|He created you of one man, and afterwards out of him formed his wife: And He hath bestowed on you four pair of cattle. He formeth you in the wombs of your mothers, by several gradual formations, within three vails of darkness. This is God your Lord: His is the kingdom: There is no God but He. Why therefore are ye turned aside from the worship of Him to idolatry
39|7|If ye be ungrateful, verily God hath no need of you; yet He liketh not ingratitude in his servants: But if ye be thankful, He will be well pleased with you. A burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another: Hereafter shall ye return unto your Lord, and He shall declare unto you that which ye have wrought, and will reward you accordingly; for He knoweth the innermost parts of your breasts
39|8|When harm befalleth a man, he calleth upon his Lord, and turneth unto Him: Yet afterwards, when God hath bestowed on him favour from himself, he forgetteth that being which he invoked before, and setteth up equals unto God, that he may seduce men from his way. Say unto such a man, enjoy this life in thy infidelity for a little while: But hereafter shalt thou surely be one of the inhabitants of hell fire
39|9|Shall he who giveth himself up to prayer in the hours of the night, prostrate, and standing, and who taketh heed as to the life to come, and hopeth for the mercy of his Lord, be dealt with as the wicked unbeliever? Say, shall they who know their duty, and they who know it not, be held equal? Verily the men of understanding only will be warned
39|10|Say, O my servants who believe, fear your Lord. They who do good in this world, shall obtain good in the next; and God's earth is spacious: Verily those who persevere with patience shall receive their recompense without measure
39|11|Say, I am commanded to worship God, and to exhibit the pure religion unto him
39|12|And I am commanded to be the first Moslem
39|13|Say, verily I fear, if I be disobedient unto my Lord, the punishment of the great day
39|14|Say, I worship God, exhibiting my religion pure unto Him
39|15|But do ye worship that which ye will, besides Him. Say verily they will be the losers, who shall lose their own souls, and their families, on the day of resurrection: Is not this manifest loss
39|16|Over them shall be roofs of fire, and under them shall be floors of fire. With this doth God terrify his servants: Wherefore, O my servants, fear me
39|17|But those who eschew the worship of idols, and are turned unto God, shall receive good tidings. Bear good tidings therefore unto my servants
39|18|who hearken unto my word, and follow that which is most excellent therein: These are they whom God directeth, and these are men of understanding
39|19|Him therefore on whom the sentence of eternal punishment shall be justly pronounced, canst thou, O Mohammed, deliver him who is destined to dwell in the fire of hell
39|20|But for those who fear their Lord will be prepared high apartments in paradise, over which shall be other apartments built; and rivers shall run beneath them: This is the promise of God; and God will not be contrary to the promise
39|21|Dost thou not see that God sendeth down water from heaven, and causeth the same to enter and form sources in the earth; and produceth thereby corn of various sorts? Afterwards He causeth the same to wither; and thou seest it become yellow: Afterwards He maketh it crumble into dust. Verily herein is an instruction to men of understanding
39|22|Shall he, therefore, whose breast God hath enlarged to receive the religion of Islam, and who followeth the light from his Lord, be as he whose heart is hardened? But woe unto those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of God! They are in a manifest error
39|23|God hath revealed a most excellent discourse; a book conformable to itself, and containing repeated admonitions. The skins of those who fear their Lord shrink for fear thereat: Afterwards their skins grow soft, and their hearts also, at the remembrance of their Lord. This is the direction of God: He will direct thereby whom He pleaseth; and whomsoever God shall cause to err, he shall have no director
39|24|Shall he therefore who shall be obliged to screen himself with his face from the severity of the punishment on the day of resurrection, be as he who is secure therefrom? And it shall be said unto the ungodly, taste that which ye have deserved
39|25|Those who were before them, accused their apostles of imposture; wherefore a punishment came upon them from whence they expected it not
39|26|And God caused them to taste shame in this present life; but the punishment of the life to come will certainly be greater. If they were men of understanding, they would know this
39|27|Now have We proposed unto mankind, in this Koran, every kind of parable; that they may be warned
39|28|An Arabic Koran, wherein there is no crookedness; that they may fear God
39|29|God propoundeth as a parable a man who hath several companions which are at mutual variance, and a man who committeth himself wholly to one person: Shall these be held in equal comparison? God forbid! But the greater part of them do not understand
39|30|Verily thou, O Mohammed, shalt die, and they also shall die
39|31|And ye shall debate the matter with one another before your Lord, at the day of resurrection
39|32|Who is more unjust than he who uttereth a lie concerning God, and denieth the truth, when it cometh unto him? Is there not a dwelling provided in hell for the unbelievers
39|33|But he who bringeth the truth, and giveth credit thereto, these are they who fear God
39|34|they shall obtain whatever they shall desire, in the sight of their Lord: This shall be the recompense of the righteous
39|35|That God may expiate from them the very worst of that which they have wrought, and may render them their reward according to the utmost merit of the good which they have wrought
39|36|Is not God a sufficient protector of his servant? Yet they will attempt to make thee afraid of the false deities which they worship besides God. But he whom God shall cause to err, shall have none to direct him
39|37|And he whom God shall direct, shall have none to mislead him. Is not God most mighty, able to avenge
39|38|If thou ask them who hath created the heavens and the earth, they will surely answer, God. Say, do ye think therefore that the deities which ye invoke besides God, if God be pleased to afflict me, are able to relieve me from his affliction? Or if he be pleased to shew mercy unto me, that they are able to withhold his mercy? Say, God is my sufficient support: In him let those put their trust, who seek in whom to confide
39|39|Say, O my people, do ye act according to your state; verily I will act according to mine: Hereafter shall ye know
39|40|on which of us will be inflicted a punishment that shall cover him with shame, and on whom a lasting punishment shall fall
39|41|Verily We have revealed unto thee the book of the Koran, for the instruction of mankind, with truth. Whoso shall be directed thereby, shall be directed to the advantage of his own soul; and whoso shall err, shall only err against the same: And thou art not a guardian over them
39|42|God taketh unto himself the souls of men at the time of their death; and those which die not He also taketh in their sleep: And He withholdeth those on which He hath passed the decree of death, but sendeth back the others till a determined period. Verily herein are signs unto people who consider
39|43|Have the Koreish taken idols for their intercessors with God? Say, what, although they have not dominion over any thing, neither do they understand
39|44|Say, intercession is altogether in the disposal of God: His is the kingdom of heaven and earth; and hereafter shall ye return unto Him
39|45|When the one sole God is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the life to come, shrink with horror: But when the false gods, which are worshipped besides Him, are mentioned, behold, they are filled with joy
39|46|Say, O God, the creator of heaven and earth, who knowest that which is secret, and that which is manifest; thou shalt judge between thy servants concerning that wherein they disagree
39|47|If those who act unjustly were masters of whatever is in the earth, and as much more therewith, verily they would give it to ransom themselves from the evil of the punishment, on the day of resurrection: And there shall appear unto them, from God, terrors which they never imagined
39|48|and there shall appear unto them the evils of that which they shall have gained; and that which they mocked at shall encompass them
39|49|When harm befalleth man, he calleth upon Us; yet afterwards, when We have bestowed on him favour from Us, he saith, I have received it merely because of God's knowledge of my deserts. On the contrary, it is a trial; but the greater part of them know it not
39|50|Those who were before them, said the same: But that which they had gained, profited them not
39|51|and the evils which they had deserved, fell upon them. And whoever of these Meccans shall have acted unjustly, on them likewise shall fall the evils which they shall have deserved; neither shall they frustrate the divine vengeance
39|52|Do they not know that God bestoweth provision abundantly on whom He pleaseth, and is sparing unto whom He pleaseth? Verily herein are signs unto people who believe
39|53|Say, O my servants who have transgressed against your own souls, despair not of the mercy of God: Seeing that God forgiveth all sins; for He is gracious and merciful
39|54|And be turned unto your Lord, and resign yourselves unto Him, before the threatened punishment overtake you; for then ye shall not be helped
39|55|And follow the most excellent instructions which have been sent down unto you from your Lord, before the punishment come suddenly upon you, and ye perceive not the approach thereof
39|56|and a soul say, alas! For that I have been negligent in my duty to God; verily I have been one of the scorners
39|57|Or say, if God had directed me, verily I had been one of the pious
39|58|Or say, when it seeth the prepared punishment, if I could return once more into the world, I would become one of the righteous
39|59|But God shall answer, my signs came unto thee heretofore, and thou didst charge them with falsehood, and wast puffed up with pride; and thou becamest one of the unbelievers
39|60|On the day of resurrection thou shalt see the faces of those who have uttered lies concerning God, become black: Is there not an abode prepared in hell for the arrogant
39|61|But God shall deliver those who shall fear Him, and shall set them in their place of safety: Evil shall not touch them, neither shall they be grieved
39|62|God is the creator of all things, and He is the governor of all things
39|63|His are the keys of heaven and earth: And they who believe not in the signs of God, they shall perish
39|64|Say, do ye therefore bid me to worship other than God, O ye fools
39|65|Since it hath been spoken by revelation unto thee, and also unto the prophets who have been before thee, saying, verily if thou join any partners with God, thy work will be altogether unprofitable, and thou shalt certainly be one of those who perish
39|66|Wherefore rather fear God, and be one of those who give thanks
39|67|But they make not a due estimation of God: Since the whole earth shall be but his handful, on the day of resurrection; and the heavens shall be rolled together in his right hand. Praise be unto Him! And far be He exalted above the idols which they associate with Him
39|68|The trumpet shall be sounded, and whoever are in heaven, and whoever are on earth shall expire; except those whom God shall please to exempt from the common fate. Afterwards it shall be sounded again; and behold, they shall arise and look up
39|69|And the earth shall shine by the light of its Lord: And the book shall be laid open, and the prophets and the martyrs shall be brought as witnesses; and judgment shall be given between them with truth, and they shall not be treated unjustly
39|70|And every soul shall be fully rewarded, according to that which it shall have wrought; for He perfectly knoweth whatever they do
39|71|And the unbelievers shall be driven unto hell by troops, until, when they shall arrive at the same, the gates thereof shall be opened: And the keepers thereof shall say unto them, did not apostles from among you come unto you, who rehearsed unto you the signs of your Lord, and warned you of the meeting of this your day? They shall answer, yea: But the sentence of eternal punishment hath been justly pronounced on the unbelievers
39|72|It shall be said unto them, enter ye the gates of hell, to dwell therein forever; and miserable shall be the abode of the proud
39|73|But those who shall have feared their Lord, shall be conducted by troops towards paradise, until they shall arrive at the same: And the gates thereof shall be ready set open; and the guards thereof shall say unto them, peace be on you! Ye have been good: Wherefore enter ye into paradise, to remain therein forever
39|74|And they shall answer, praise be unto God, Who hath performed his promise unto us, and hath made us to inherit the earth, that we may dwell in paradise whereever we please! How excellent is the reward of those who work righteousness
39|75|And thou shalt see the angels going in procession round the throne, celebrating the praises of their Lord: And judgment shall be given between them with truth; and they shall say, praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
40|1|M
40|2|The revelation of this book is from the mighty, the wise God
40|3|the forgiver of sin, and the accepter of repentance; severe in punishing; long suffering. There is no God but He: Before Him shall be the general assembly at the last day
40|4|None disputeth against the signs of God, except the unbelievers: But let not their prosperous dealing in the land deceive thee with vain allurement
40|5|The people of Noah, and the confederated infidels which were after them, accused their respective prophets of imposture before these; and each nation hatched ill designs against their apostle, that they might get him into their power; and they disputed with vain reasoning; that they might thereby invalidate the truth: Wherefore I chastised them; and how severe was my punishment
40|6|Thus hath the sentence of thy Lord justly passed on the unbelievers; that they shall be the inhabitants of hell fire
40|7|The angels who bear the throne of God, and those who stand about it, celebrate the praise of their Lord, and believe in Him; and they ask pardon for the true believers, saying, O Lord, thou encompassest all things by thy mercy and knowledge; wherefore forgive those who repent, and follow thy path, and deliver them from the pains of hell
40|8|O Lord, lead them also into gardens of eternal abode, which Thou hast promised unto them, and unto every one who shall do right, of their fathers, and their wives, and their children; for thou art the mighty, the wise God
40|9|And deliver them from evil; for whomsoever Thou shalt deliver from evil on that day, on him wilt Thou shew mercy; and this will be great salvation
40|10|But the infidels, at the day of judgment, shall hear a voice crying unto them, verily the hatred of God towards you is more grievous than your hatred towards yourselves: Since ye were called unto the faith, and would not believe
40|11|They shall say, O Lord, Thou hast given us death twice, and Thou hast twice given us life; and we confess our sins: Is there therefore no way to get forth from this fire
40|12|And it shall be answered them, this hath befallen you, for that when one God was preached unto you, ye believed not; but if a plurality of gods had been associated with Him, ye had believed: And judgment belongeth unto the high, the great God
40|13|It is He who sheweth you his signs, and sendeth down food unto you from heaven: But none will be admonished, except he who turneth himself unto God
40|14|Call therefore upon God, exhibiting your religion pure unto Him, although the infidels be averse thereto
40|15|He is the being of exalted degree, the possessor of the throne; who sendeth down the spirit, at his command, on such of his servants as He pleaseth; that He may warn mankind of the day of meeting
40|16|the day whereon they shall come forth out of their graves, and nothing of what concerneth them shall be hidden from God. Unto Whom will the kingdom belong, on that day? Unto the only, the almighty God
40|17|On that day shall every soul be rewarded according to its merit: There shall be no injustice done on that day. Verily God will be swift in taking an account
40|18|Wherefore warn them, O prophet, of the day which shall suddenly approach; when men's hearts shall come up to their throats, and strangle them. The ungodly shall have no friend or intercessor who shall be heard
40|19|God will know the deceitful eye, and that which their breasts conceal
40|20|and God will judge with truth: But the false gods which they invoke, besides Him, shall not judge at all; for God is He who heareth and seeth
40|21|Have they not gone through the earth, and seen what hath been the end of those who were before them? They were more mighty than these in strength, and left more considerable footsteps of their power in the earth: Yet God chastised them for their sins, and there was none to protect them from God
40|22|This they suffered, because their apostles had come unto them with evident signs, and they disbelieved: Wherefore God chastised them; for He is strong, and severe in punishing
40|23|We heretofore sent Moses with our signs and manifest power
40|24|unto Pharaoh, and Haman, and Karoon; and they said, he is a sorcerer, and a liar
40|25|And when he came unto them with the truth from Us, they said, slay the sons of those who have believed with him, and save their daughters alive: But the stratagem of the infidels was no other than vain
40|26|And Pharaoh said, let me alone, that I may kill Moses; and let him call upon his Lord: Verily I fear lest he change your religion, or cause violence to appear in the earth
40|27|And Moses said unto his people, verily I have recourse unto my Lord, and your Lord, to defend me against every proud person, who believeth not in the day of account
40|28|And a man who was a true believer, of the family of Pharaoh, and concealed in his faith, said, will ye put a man to death, because he saith, God is my Lord; seeing he is come unto you with evident signs from your Lord? If he be a liar, on him will the punishment of his falsehood light; but if he speaketh the truth, some of those judgments with which he threateneth you, will fall upon you: Verily God directeth not him who is a transgressor, or a liar
40|29|O my people, the kingdom is yours this day; and ye are conspicuous in the earth: But who shall defend us from the scourge of God, if it come unto us? Pharaoh said, I only propose to you what I think to be most expedient: And I guide you only into the right path
40|30|And he who had believed, said, O my people, verily I fear for you a day like that of the confederates against the prophets in former times
40|31|a condition like that of the people of Noah, and the tribes of Ad, and Thamud, and of those who have lived after them: For God willeth not that any injustice be done unto his servants
40|32|O my people, verily I fear for you the day whereon men shall call unto one another
40|33|the day whereon ye shall be turned back from the tribunal, and driven to hell: Then shall ye have none to protect you against God. And he whom God shall cause to err, shall have no director
40|34|Joseph came unto you, before Moses, with evident signs; but ye ceased not to doubt of the religion which he preached unto you, until, when he died, ye said, God will by no means send another apostle, after him. Thus doth God cause him to err, who is a transgressor, and a sceptic
40|35|They who dispute against the signs of God, without any authority which hath come unto them, are in great abomination with God, and with those who believe. Thus doth God seal up every proud and stubborn heart
40|36|And Pharaoh said, O Haman, build me a tower, that I may reach the tracts
40|37|the tracts of heaven, and may view the God of Moses; for I verily think him to be a liar. And thus the evil of his work was prepared for Pharaoh, and he turned aside from the right path: And the stratagems of Pharaoh ended only in loss
40|38|And he who had believed, said, O my people, follow me: I will guide you into the right way
40|39|O my people, verily this present life is but a temporary enjoyment; but the life to come is the mansion of firm continuance
40|40|Whoever worketh evil, shall only be rewarded in equal proportion to the same: But whoever worketh good, whether male or female, and is a true believer, they shall enter paradise; they shall be provided for therein superabundantly
40|41|And, O my people, as for me, I invite you to salvation; but ye invite me to hell fire
40|42|Ye invite me to deny God, and to associate with him that whereof I have no knowledge; but I invite you to the most mighty, the forgiver of sins
40|43|There is no doubt but that the false gods to which ye invite me, deserve not to be invoked, either in this world or in the next; and that we must return unto God; and that the transgressors shall be the inhabitants of hell fire
40|44|And ye shall then remember what I now say unto you. And I commit my affair unto God: For God regardeth his servants
40|45|Wherefore God delivered him from the evils which they had devised; and a grievous punishment encompassed the people of Pharaoh
40|46|They shall be exposed to the fire of hell morning and evening: And the day whereon the hour of judgment shall come, it shall be said unto them, enter O people of Pharaoh, into a most severe torment
40|47|And think on the time when the infidels shall dispute together in hell fire; and the weak shall say unto those who behaved with arrogance, verily we were your followers: Will ye, therefore, relieve us from any part of this fire
40|48|Those who behaved with arrogance shall answer, verily we are all doomed to suffer therein: For God hath now judged between his servants
40|49|And they who shall be in the fire, shall say unto the keepers of hell, call ye on your Lord, that He would ease us, for one day, from this punishment
40|50|They shall answer, did not your apostles come unto you with evident proofs? They shall say, yea. The keepers shall reply, do ye therefore call on God: But the calling of the unbelievers on Him shall be only in vain
40|51|We will surely assist our apostles, and those who believe, in this present life, and on the day whereon the witnesses shall stand forth
40|52|A day, whereon the excuse of the unbelievers shall not avail them; but a curse shall attend them, and a wretched abode
40|53|We heretofore gave unto Moses a direction: And We left as an inheritance unto the children of Israel the book of the law
40|54|a direction, and an admonition to men of understanding
40|55|Wherefore do thou, O prophet, bear the insults of the infidels with patience; for the promise of God is true: And ask pardon for thy fault; and celebrate the praise of thy Lord, in the evening and in the morning
40|56|As to those who impugn the signs of God, without any convincing proof which hath been revealed unto them, there is nothing but pride in their breasts; but they shall not attain their desire: Wherefore fly for refuge unto God; for it is He who heareth and seeth
40|57|Verily the creation of heaven and earth is more considerable than the creation of man: But the greater part of men do not understand
40|58|The blind and the seeing shall not be held equal; nor they who believe and work righteousness, and the evildoer: How few revolve these things in their mind
40|59|The last hour will surely come; there is no doubt thereof: But the greater part of men believe it not
40|60|Your Lord saith, call upon Me; and I will hear you: But they who proudly disdain my service, shall enter with ignominy into hell
40|61|It is God who hath appointed the night for you to take your rest therein, and the day to give you light: Verily God is endued with beneficence towards mankind; but the greater part of men do not give thanks
40|62|This is God, your Lord; the creator of all things: There is no God besides Him: How therefore are ye turned aside from his worship
40|63|Thus are they turned aside, who oppose the signs of God
40|64|It is God who hath given you the earth for a stable floor, and the heaven for a ceiling: And who hath formed you, and made your forms beautiful; and feedeth you with good things. This is God, your Lord. Wherefore blessed be God, the Lord of all creatures
40|65|He is the living God: There is no God but He. Wherefore call upon Him, exhibiting unto Him the pure religion. Praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
40|66|Say, verily I am forbidden to worship the deities which ye invoke, besides God, after that evident proofs have come unto me from my Lord; and I am commanded to resign myself unto the Lord of all creatures
40|67|It is He who first created you of dust, and afterwards of seed, and afterwards of coagulated blood; and afterwards brought you forth infants out of your mothers wombs: Then He permitteth you to attain your age of full strength, and afterwards to grow old men, -- but some of you die before that age, -- and to arrive at the determined period of your life; that peradventure ye may understand
40|68|It is He who giveth life, and causeth to die: And when He decreeth a thing, He only saith unto it, be, and it is
40|69|Dost thou not observe those who dispute against the signs of God, how they are turned aside from the true faith
40|70|They who charge with falsehood the book of the Koran, and the other scriptures and revealed doctrines which We sent our former apostles to preach, shall hereafter know their folly
40|71|When the collars shall be on their necks, and the chains by which
40|72|they shall be dragged into hell: Then shall they be burned in the fire
40|73|And it shall be said unto them, where are the gods which ye associated
40|74|besides God? They shall answer, they have withdrawn themselves from us: Yea, we called on nothing heretofore. Thus doth God lead the unbelievers into error
40|75|This hath befallen you, for that ye rejoiced insolently on earth, in that which was false; and for that ye were elated with immoderate joy
40|76|Enter ye the gates of hell, to remain therein for ever: And wretched shall be the abode of the haughty
40|77|Wherefore persevere with patience, O Mohammed; for the promise of God is true. Whether We cause thee to see any part of the punishment with which We have threatened them, or whether We cause thee to die before thou see it; before Us shall they be assembled at the last day
40|78|We have sent a great number of apostles before thee; the histories of some of whom We have related unto thee, and the histories of others of them We have not related unto thee: But no apostle had the power to produce a sign, unless by the permission of God. When the command of God, therefore, shall come, judgment shall be given with truth; and then shall they perish who endeavour to render the signs of God of no effect
40|79|It is God who hath given you the cattle, that ye may ride on some of them, and may eat of others of them
40|80|ye also receive other advantages therefrom; -- and that on them ye may arrive at the business proposed in your mind: And on them are ye carried by land, and on ships by sea
40|81|And He sheweth you his signs; which, therefore, of the signs of God, will ye deny
40|82|Do they not pass through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who were before them? They were more numerous than these, and more mighty in strength, and left more considerable monuments of their power in the earth: Yet that which they had acquired, profited them not
40|83|And when their apostles came unto them with evident proofs of their mission, they rejoiced in the knowledge which was with them: But that which they mocked at, encompassed them
40|84|And when they beheld our vengeance, they said, we believe in God alone, and we renounce the idols which we associated with Him
40|85|But their faith availed them not, after they had beholden our vengeance. This was the ordinance of God, which was formerly observed in respect to his servants: And then did the unbelievers perish
41|1|M
41|2|This is a revelation from the most Merciful
41|3|A book the verses whereof are distinctly explained, an Arabic Koran, for the instruction of people who understand
41|4|bearing good tidings, and denouncing threats: But the greater part of them turn aside, and hearken not thereto
41|5|And they say, our hearts are veiled from the doctrine to which thou invitest us; and there is a deafness in our ears, and a curtain between us and thee: Wherefore act thou, as thou shalt think fit; for we shall act according to our own sentiments
41|6|Say, verily I am only a man like you. It is revealed unto me that your God is one God: Wherefore direct your way strait unto Him; and ask pardon of Him for what is past. And woe be to the idolaters
41|7|who give not the appointed alms, and believe not in the life to come
41|8|But as to those who believe, and work righteousness; they shall receive an everlasting reward
41|9|Say, do ye indeed disbelieve in Him who created the earth in two days; and do ye set up equals unto Him? He is the Lord of all creatures
41|10|And He placed in the earth mountains firmly rooted, rising above the same: And He blessed it; and provided therein the food of the creatures designed to be the inhabitants thereof, in four days; equally, for those who ask
41|11|Then He set his mind to the creation of heaven; and it was smoke: And He said unto it, and to the earth, come, either obediently, or against your will. They answered, we come, obedient to thy command
41|12|And He formed them into seven heavens, in two days; and revealed unto every heaven its office. And We adorned the lower heaven with lights, and placed therein a guard of angels. This is the disposition of the mighty, the wise God
41|13|If the Meccans withdraw from these instructions, say, I denounce unto you a sudden destruction, like the destruction of Ad and Thamud
41|14|When the apostles came unto them before them and behind them, saying, worship God alone; they answered, if our Lord had been pleased to send messengers, He had surely sent angels: And we believe not the message with which ye are sent
41|15|As to the tribe of Ad, they behaved insolently in the earth, without reason, and said, who is more mighty than we in strength? Did they not see that God, who had created them, was more mighty than they in strength? And they knowingly rejected our signs
41|16|Wherefore We sent against them a piercing wind, on days of ill luck, that We might make them taste the punishment of shame in this world: But the punishment of the life to come will be more shameful; and they shall not be protected therefrom
41|17|And as to Thamud, We directed them; but they loved blindness better than the true direction: Wherefore the terrible noise of an ignominious punishment assailed them, for that which they had deserved
41|18|but We delivered those who believed, and feared God
41|19|And warn them of the day, on which the enemies of God shall be gathered together unto hell fire, and shall march in distinct bands
41|20|until, when they shall arrive thereat their ears, and their eyes, and their skins shall bear witness against them of that which they shall have wrought
41|21|And they shall say unto their skins, wherefore do ye bear witness against us? They shall answer, God hath caused us to speak, who giveth speech unto all things: He created you the first time; and unto Him are ye returned
41|22|Ye did not hide your selves, while ye sinned, so that your ears, and your eyes, and your skins could not bear witness against you: But ye thought that God was ignorant of many things which ye did
41|23|This was your opinion, which ye imagined of your Lord: It hath ruined you; and ye are become lost people
41|24|Whether they bear their torment, hell fire shall be their abode; or whether they beg for favour, they shall not obtain favour
41|25|And We will give them the devils to be their companions; for they dressed up for them the false notions which they entertained of this present world, and of that which is to come; and the sentence justly fitteth them, which was formerly pronounced on the nations of genii and men who were before them; for they perished
41|26|The unbelievers say, hearken not unto this Koran: But use vain discourse during the reading thereof; that ye may overcome the voice of the reader by your scoffs and laughter
41|27|Wherefore We will surely cause the unbelievers to taste a grievous punishment, and We will certainly reward them for the evils which they shall have wrought
41|28|This shall be the reward of the enemies of God, namely, hell fire; therein is prepared for them an everlasting abode, as a reward for that they have wittingly rejected our signs
41|29|And the infidels shall say in hell, O Lord, shew us the two who seduced us, of the genii and men, and we will cast them under our feet, that they may become most base and despicable
41|30|As for those who say, our Lord is God, and who behave uprightly; the angels shall descend unto them, and shall say, fear not, neither be ye grieved; but rejoice in the hopes of paradise, which ye have been promised
41|31|We are your friends in this life, and in that which is to come: Therein shall ye have that which your souls shall desire, and therein shall ye obtain whatever ye shall ask for
41|32|as a gift from a gracious, and merciful God
41|33|Who speaketh better than he who inviteth unto God, and worketh righteousness, and saith, I am a Moslem
41|34|Good and evil shall not be held equal. Turn away evil with that which is better; and behold, the man between whom and thyself there was enmity, shall become, as it were, thy warmest friend
41|35|But none shall attain to this perfection, except they who are patient; nor shall any attain thereto, except he who is indued with a great happiness of temper
41|36|And if a malicious suggestion be offered unto thee from Satan, have recourse unto God; for it is He who heareth and knoweth
41|37|Among the signs of his power are the night, and the day, and the sun, and the moon. Worship not the sun, neither the moon: But worship God, who hath created them; if ye serve Him
41|38|But if they proudly disdain his service; verily the angels, who are with thy Lord, praise Him night and day, and are not wearied
41|39|And among his signs another is, that thou seest the land waste: But when we send down rain thereon, it is stirred and fermenteth. And he who quickeneth the earth, will surely quicken the dead; for he is almighty
41|40|Verily those who impiously wrong our signs, are not concealed from Us. Is he, therefore, better, who shall be cast into hell fire, or he who shall appear secure on the day of resurrection? Work that which ye will: He certainly beholdeth whatever ye do
41|41|Verily they who believe not in the admonition of the Koran, after it hath come unto them, shall one day be discovered. It is certainly a book of infinite value
41|42|Vanity shall not approach it, either from before it, or from behind it: It is a revelation from a wise God, whose praise is justly to be celebrated
41|43|No other is said unto thee by the infidels of Mecca, than what hath been formerly said, unto the apostles before thee: Verily thy Lord is inclined to forgiveness, and is also able to chastise severely
41|44|If We had revealed the Koran in a foreign language, they had surely said, unless the signs thereof be distinctly explained, we will not receive the same: Is the book written in a foreign tongue, and the person unto whom it is directed, an Arabian? Answer, it is, unto those who believe, a sure guide, and a remedy for doubt and uncertainty: But unto those who believe not, it is a thickness of hearing in their ears, and it is a darkness which covereth them; these are as they who are called unto from a distant place
41|45|We heretofore gave the book of the law unto Moses; and a dispute arose concerning the same: And if a previous decree had not proceeded from thy Lord, to respite the opposers of that revelation, verily the matter had been decided between them, by the destruction of the infidels; for they were in a very great doubt as to the same
41|46|He who doth right, doth it to the advantage of his own soul; and he who doth evil, doth it against the same: For thy Lord is not unjust towards his servants
41|47|Unto Him is reserved the knowledge of the hour of judgment: And no fruit cometh forth from the knops which involve it; neither doth any female conceive in her womb, nor is she delivered of her burden, but with his knowledge. On the day whereon He shall call them to Him, saying, where are my companions which ye ascribed unto Me? They shall answer, we assure Thee there is no witness of this matter among us
41|48|And the idols which they called on before, shall withdraw themselves from them; and they shall perceive that there will be no way to escape
41|49|Man is not wearied with asking good; but if evil befall him, he despondeth, and despaireth
41|50|And if We cause him to taste mercy from Us, after affliction hath touched him, he surely saith, this is due to me on account of my deserts: I do not think the hour of judgment will ever come; and if I be brought before my Lord, I shall surely attain, with Him, the most excellent condition. But We will then declare unto those who shall not have believed, that which they have wrought; and We will surely cause them to taste a most severe punishment
41|51|When We confer favours on man, he turneth aside, and departeth without returning thanks: But when evil toucheth him, he is frequent at prayer
41|52|Say, what think ye? If the Koran be from God, and ye believe not therein; who will lie under a greater error, than he who dissenteth widely therefrom
41|53|Hereafter We will shew them our signs in the regions of the earth, and in themselves; until it become manifest unto them that this book is the truth. Is it not sufficient for thee that thy Lord is witness of all things
41|54|Are they not in a doubt as to the meeting of their Lord at the resurrection? Doth not He encompass all things
42|1|M
42|2|K
42|3|Thus doth the mighty, the wise God reveal his will unto thee; and in like manner did He reveal it unto the prophets who were before thee
42|4|Unto Him belongeth whatever is in heaven, and in earth; and He is the high, the great God
42|5|It wanteth little but that the heavens be rent in sunder from above, at the awfulness of his majesty: The angels celebrate the praise of their Lord, and ask pardon for those who dwell in the earth. Is not God the forgiver of sins, the merciful
42|6|But as to those who take other gods for their patrons, besides Him, God observeth their actions: For thou art not a steward over them
42|7|Thus have We revealed unto thee an Arabic Koran, that thou mayest warn the metropolis of Mecca, and the Arabs who dwell round about it; and mayest threaten them with the day of the general assembly, of which there is no doubt: One part shall then be placed in paradise, and another part in hell
42|8|If God had pleased, He had made them all of one religion: But He leadeth whom He pleaseth into his mercy; and the unjust shall have no patron or helper
42|9|Do they take other patrons, besides Him? Whereas God is the only true patron: He quickeneth the dead; and He is almighty
42|10|Whatever matter ye disagree about, the decision thereof appertaineth unto God. This is God, my Lord: In him do I trust, and unto him do I turn me
42|11|the creator of heaven and earth: He hath given you wives of your owns species, and cattle both male and female; by which means He multiplieth you: There is nothing like Him; and it is He who heareth and seeth
42|12|His are the keys of heaven and earth: He bestoweth provision abundantly on whom He pleaseth, and He is sparing unto whom He pleaseth; for He knoweth all things
42|13|He hath ordained you the religion which He commanded Noah, and which We have revealed unto thee, O Mohammed, and which We commanded Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus: Saying, observe this religion, and be not divided therein. The worship of one God, to which thou invitest them, is grievous unto the unbelievers: God will elect thereto whom He pleaseth, and will direct unto the same him who shall repent
42|14|Those who lived in times past were not divided among themselves, until after that the knowledge of God's unity had come unto them; through their own perverseness: And unless a previous decree had passed from thy Lord, to bear with them till a determined time, verily the matter had been decided between them, by the destruction of the gain-sayers. They who have inherited the scriptures after them, are certainly in a perplexing doubt concerning the same
42|15|Wherefore invite them to receive the sure faith, and be urgent with them, as thou hast been commanded; and follow not their vain desires: And say, I believe in all the scriptures which God hath sent down; and I am commanded to establish justice among you: God is our Lord, and your Lord: Unto us will our works be imputed, and unto you will your works be imputed: Let there be no wrangling between us and you; for God will assemble us all at the last day, and unto Him shall we return
42|16|As to those who dispute concerning God, after obedience hath been paid Him by receiving his religion, their disputing shall be vain in the sight of their Lord; and wrath shall fall on them, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment
42|17|It is God who hath sent down the scripture with truth; and the balance of true judgment: And what shall inform thee whether the hour be nigh at hand
42|18|They who believe not therein, wish it to be hastened by way of mockery: But they who believe dread the same, and know it to be the truth. Are not those who dispute concerning the last hour in a wide error
42|19|God is bounteous unto his servants: He provideth for whom He pleaseth; and He is the strong, the mighty
42|20|Whoso chooseth the tillage of the life to come, unto him will We give increase in his tillage: And whoso chooseth the tillage of this world, We will give him the fruit thereof; but he shall have no part in the life to come
42|21|Have the idolaters deities which ordain them a religion which God hath not allowed? But had it not been for the decree of respiting their punishment to the day of separating the infidels from the true believers, judgment had been already given between them: For the unjust shall surely suffer a painful torment
42|22|On that day thou shalt see the unjust in great terror, because of their demerits; and the penalty thereof shall fall upon them: But they who believe and do good works, shall dwell in the delightful meadows of paradise; they shall obtain whatever they shalt desire, with their Lord. This is the greatest acquisition
42|23|This is what God promiseth unto his servants who believe and do good works. Say, I ask not of you, for this my preaching, any reward, except the love of my relations: And whoever shall have deserved well by one good action, unto him will we add the merit of another action thereto; for God is inclined to forgive, and ready to reward
42|24|Do they say, Mohammed hath blasphemously forged a lie concerning God? If God pleaseth, he will seal up thy heart: And God will absolutely abolish vanity, and will establish the truth in his words; for He knoweth the innermost parts of men's breasts
42|25|It is He who accepteth repentance from his servants, and forgiveth sins, and knoweth that which ye do
42|26|He will incline his ear unto those who believe and work righteousness, and will add unto them above what they shall ask or deserve, of his bounty: But the unbelievers shall suffer a severe punishment
42|27|If God should bestow abundance upon his servants, they would certainly behave insolently in the earth: But He sendeth down by measure unto every one that which he pleaseth; for He well knoweth and seeth the condition of his servants
42|28|It is He who sendeth down the rain, after men have despaired thereof, and spreadeth abroad his mercy; and He is the patron, justly to be praised
42|29|Among his signs is the creation of heaven and earth, and of the living creatures with which He hath replenished them both; and He is able to gather them together before his tribunal, whenever He pleaseth
42|30|Whatever misfortune befalleth you is sent you by God, for that which your hands have deserved; and yet He forgiveth many things
42|31|Ye shall not frustrate the divine vengeance in the earth; neither shall ye have any protector or helper, against God
42|32|Among his signs also are the ships running in the sea, like high mountains
42|33|If He pleaseth, He causeth the wind to cease, and they lie still on the back of the water: -- verily herein are signs, unto every patient and grateful person
42|34|Or He destroyeth them by shipwreck, because of that which their crews have merited; though He pardoneth many things
42|35|And they who dispute against our signs, shall know that there will be no way for them to escape our vengeance
42|36|Whatever things are given you, they are the provision of this present life: But the reward which is with God is better, and more durable, for those who believe, and put their trust in their Lord
42|37|and who avoid hainous and filthy crimes, and when they are angry, forgive
42|38|and who hearken unto their Lord, and are constant at prayer, and whose affairs are directed by consultation among themselves, and who give alms out of what We have bestowed on them
42|39|and who, when an injury is done them, avenge themselves
42|40|And the retaliation of evil ought to be an evil proportionate thereto: -- But he who forgiveth, and is reconciled unto his enemy, shall receive his reward from God; for He loveth not the unjust doers
42|41|And whoso shall avenge himself, after he hath been injured; as to these, it is not lawful to punish them for it
42|42|But it is only lawful to punish those who wrong men, and act insolently in the earth, against justice; these shall suffer a grievous punishment
42|43|And whoso beareth injuries patiently, and forgiveth; verily this is a necessary work
42|44|Whom God shall cause to err, he shall afterwards have no protector. And thou shalt see the ungodly, who shall say, when they behold the punishment prepared for them, is there no way to return back into the world
42|45|And thou shalt see them exposed unto hell fire; dejected, because of the ignominy they shall undergo: They shall look at the fire sideways, and by stealth; and the true believers shall say, verily the losers are they who have lost their own souls, and their families, on the day of resurrection: Shall not the ungodly continue in eternal torment
42|46|They shall have no protectors to defend them against God: And whom God shall cause to err, he shall find no way to the truth
42|47|Hearken unto your Lord, before the day come, which God will not keep back: Ye shall have no place of refuge on that day; neither shall ye be able to deny your sins
42|48|But if those to whom thou preachest turn aside from thy admonitions, verily We have not sent thee to be a guardian over them: Thy duty is preaching only. When We cause man to taste mercy from Us, he rejoiceth thereat: But if evil befall them, for that which their hands have formerly committed, verily man becometh ungrateful
42|49|Unto God appertaineth the kingdom of heaven and earth: He createth that which He pleaseth; He giveth females unto whom He pleaseth, and He giveth males unto whom He pleaseth
42|50|or He giveth them males and females jointly: And He maketh whom He pleaseth to be childless; for He is wise, and powerful
42|51|It is not fit for man, that God should speak unto him otherwise than by private revelation, or from behind a veil, or by his sending of a messenger to reveal, by his permission, that which He pleaseth; for He is high and wise
42|52|Thus have We revealed unto thee a revelation, by our command. Thou didst not understand, before this, what the book of the Koran was, nor what the faith was: But We have ordained the same for a light; We will thereby direct such of our servants as We please: And thou shalt surely direct them into the right way
42|53|the way of God, unto whom belongeth whatever is heaven and in earth. Shall not all things return unto God
43|1|M
43|2|By the perspicuous book
43|3|verily We have ordained the same an Arabic Koran, that ye may understand
43|4|And it is certainly written in the original book, kept with Us, being sublime and full of wisdom
43|5|Shall We therefore turn away from you the admonition, and deprive you thereof, because ye are a people who transgress
43|6|And how many prophets have We sent among those of old
43|7|And no prophet came unto them, but they laughed him to scorn
43|8|Wherefore We destroyed nations who were more mighty than these in strength; and the example of those who were of old, hath been already set before them
43|9|If thou ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly answer, the mighty, the wise God created them
43|10|Who hath spread the earth as a bed for you, and hath made you paths therein, that ye may be directed
43|11|And Who sendeth down rain from heaven by measure, whereby We quicken a dead country; -- so shall ye be brought forth from your graves
43|12|And Who hath created all the various species of things, and hath given you ships and cattle, whereon ye are carried
43|13|that ye may sit firmly on the backs thereof, and may remember the favour of your Lord, when ye sit thereon, and may say, praise be unto Him, Who hath subjected these unto our service! For we could not have mastered them by our own power
43|14|And unto our Lord shall we surely return
43|15|Yet have they attributed unto Him some of his servants as his offspring: Verily man is openly ungrateful
43|16|Hath God taken daughters out of those beings which He hath created; and hath He chosen sons for you
43|17|But when one of them hath the news brought of the birth of a child of that sex which they attribute unto the Merciful, as his similitude, his face becometh black, and he is oppressed with sorrow
43|18|Do they therefore attribute unto God female issue, which are brought up among ornaments, and are contentious without cause
43|19|And do they make the angels, who are the servants of the Merciful, females? Were they present at their creation? Their testimony shall be written down, and they shall be examined concerning the same, on the day of judgment
43|20|And they say, if the Merciful had pleased, we had not worshipped them. They have no knowledge herein: They only utter a vain lie
43|21|Have We given them a book of revelations before this; and do they keep the same in their custody
43|22|But they say, verily we found our fathers practising a religion; and we are guided in their footsteps
43|23|Thus We sent no preacher, before thee, unto any city, but the inhabitants thereof who lived in affluence, said, verily we found our fathers practising a religion: And we tread in their footsteps
43|24|And the preacher answered, what, although I bring you a more right religion than that which ye found your fathers to practise? And they replied, verily we believe not that which ye are sent to preach
43|25|Wherefore We took vengeance on them: And behold what hath been the end of those who accused our apostles of imposture
43|26|Remember when Abraham said unto his father, and his people, verily I am clear of the gods which ye worship
43|27|except Him who hath created me; for He will direct me aright
43|28|And he ordained this to be a constant doctrine among his posterity; that they should be turned from idolatry to the worship of the only true God
43|29|Verily I have permitted these Meccans and their fathers to live in prosperity, until the truth should come unto them, and a manifest apostle
43|30|But now the truth is come unto them, they say, this is a piece of sorcery; and we believe not therein
43|31|And they say, had this Koran been sent down unto some great man of either of the two cities, we would have received it
43|32|Do they distribute the mercy of thy Lord? We distribute their nesessary provision among them, in this present life, and We raise some of them several degrees above the others, that the one of them may take the other to serve him: And the mercy of thy Lord is more valuable than the riches which they gather together
43|33|If it were not that mankind would have become one sect of infidels, verily We had given unto those who believe not in the Merciful, roofs of silver to their houses, and stairs of silver, by which they might ascend thereto
43|34|and doors of silver to their houses, and couches of silver, for them to lean on
43|35|and ornaments of gold: For all this is the provision of the present life; but the next life with thy Lord shall be for those who fear Him
43|36|Whoever shall withdraw from the admonition of the Merciful, We will chain a devil unto him; and he shall be his inseparable companion
43|37|And the devils shall turn them aside from the way of truth; yet they shall imagine themselves to be rightly directed
43|38|Until, when he shall appear before us at the last day, he shall say unto the devil, would to God that between me and thee there was the distance of the east from the west! Oh how wretched a companion art thou
43|39|But wishes shall not avail you on this day, since ye have been unjust; for ye shall be partakers of the same punishment
43|40|Canst thou, O prophet, make the deaf to hear, or canst thou direct the blind, and him who is in a manifest error
43|41|Whether We take thee away, We will surely take vengeance on them
43|42|or whether We cause thee to see the punishment with which We have threatened them, executed, We will certainly prevail over them
43|43|Wherefore hold fast the doctrine which hath been revealed unto thee; for thou art in a right way
43|44|And it is a memorial unto thee and thy people, and hereafter shall ye be examined concerning your observance thereof
43|45|And ask our apostles whom We have sent before thee, whether We have appointed gods for them to worship, besides the Merciful
43|46|We formerly sent Moses with our signs unto Pharaoh and his princes, and he said, verily I am the apostle of the Lord of all creatures
43|47|And when he came unto them with our signs, behold, they laughed him to scorn
43|48|although We shewed them no sign, but it was greater than the other: And We inflicted a punishment on them, that peradventure they might be converted
43|49|And they said unto Moses, O magician, pray unto thy Lord for us, according to the covenant which He hath made with thee; for we will certainly be directed
43|50|But when We took the plague from off them, behold, they brake their promise
43|51|And Pharaoh made proclamation among his people, saying, O my people, is not the kingdom of Egypt mine, and these rivers which flow beneath me? Do ye not see
43|52|Am not I better than this Moses; who is a contemptible person, and can scarce express himself intelligibly
43|53|Have bracelets of gold, therefore, been put upon him; or do the angels attend him in orderly procession
43|54|And Pharaoh persuaded his people to light behaviour; and they obeyed him: For they were a wicked people
43|55|And when they had provoked Us to wrath, We took vengeance on them, and We drowned them all
43|56|And We made them a precedent, and an example unto others
43|57|And when the son of Mary was proposed for an example; behold, thy people cried out through excess of joy thereat
43|58|and they said, are our gods better, or he? They have proposed this instance unto Thee no otherwise than for an occasion of dispute. Yea, they are contentious men
43|59|Jesus is no other than a servant, whom We favoured with the gift of prophecy; and We appointed him for an example unto the the children of Israel
43|60|If we pleased, verily We could from your selves produce angels, to succeed you in the earth
43|61|And he shall be a sign of the approach of the last hour; wherefore doubt not thereof. And follow Me: This is the right way
43|62|And let not Satan cause you to turn aside: For he is your open enemy
43|63|And when Jesus came with evident miracles, he said, now am I come unto you with wisdom; and to explain unto you part of those things concerning which ye disagree: Wherefore fear God, and obey me
43|64|Verily God is my Lord, and your Lord; wherefore worship Him: This is the right way
43|65|And the confederated sects among them fell to variance: But woe unto those who have acted unjustly, because of the punishment of a grievous day
43|66|Do the unbelievers wait for any other than the hour of judgment; that it may come upon them suddenly, while they foresee it not
43|67|The intimate friends, on that day, shall be enemies unto one another; except the pious
43|68|O my servants, there shall no fear come on you this day, neither shall ye be grieved
43|69|who have believed in our signs, and have been Moslems
43|70|Enter ye into paradise, ye and your wives, with great joy
43|71|Dishes of gold shall be carried round unto them, and cups without handles: And therein shall they enjoy whatever their souls shall desire, and whatever their eyes shall delight in: And ye shall remain therein for ever
43|72|This is paradise, which ye have inherited as a reward for that which ye have wrought
43|73|Therein shall ye have fruits in abundance, of which ye shall eat
43|74|But the wicked shall remain for ever in the torment of hell
43|75|It shall not be made lighter unto them; and they shall despair therein
43|76|We deal not unjustly with them, but they deal unjustly with their own souls
43|77|And they shall call aloud, saying, O Malec, intercede for us that thy Lord would end us by annihilation. He shall answer, verily ye shall remain here forever
43|78|We brought you the truth heretofore, but the greater part of you abhorred the truth
43|79|Have the infidels fixed on a method to circumvent our apostle? Verily We will fix on a method to circumvent them
43|80|Do they imagine that We hear not their secrets, and their private discourse? Yea; and our messengers who attend them write down the same
43|81|Say, if the Merciful had a son, verily I would be the first of those who should worship him
43|82|Far be the Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord of the throne, from that which they affirm of him
43|83|Wherefore let them wade in their vanity, and divert themselves, until they arrive at their day with which they have been threatened
43|84|He who is God in heaven, is God on earth also: And He is the wise, the knowing
43|85|And blessed be He unto whom appertaineth the kingdom of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them; with Whom is the knowledge of the last hour; and before Whom ye shall be assembled
43|86|They whom they invoke besides Him, have not the privilege to intercede for others; except those who bear witness to the truth, and know the same
43|87|If thou ask them who hath created them, they will surely answer, God. How therefore are they turned away to the worship of others? God also heareth
43|88|the saying of the prophet, O Lord, verily these are people who believe not
43|89|And He answereth, therefore turn aside from them; and say, peace: Hereafter shall they know their folly
44|1|M
44|2|By the perspicuous book of the Koran
44|3|verily We have sent down the same on a blessed night, -- for We had engaged so to do
44|4|on the night wherein is distinctly sent down the decree of every determined thing, as a command from Us
44|5|Verily We have ever used to send apostles with revelations, at proper intervals
44|6|as a mercy from thy Lord; for it is He who heareth and knoweth
44|7|The Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them; if ye are men of sure knowledge
44|8|There is no God but He: He giveth life, and He causeth to die; he is your Lord, and the Lord of your fore-fathers
44|9|Yet do they amuse themselves with doubt
44|10|But observe them on the day whereon the heaven shall produce a visible smoke
44|11|which shall cover mankind: This will be a tormenting plague
44|12|They shall say, O Lord, take this plague from off us: Verily we will become true believers
44|13|How should an admonition be of avail to them in this condition; when a manifest apostle came unto them
44|14|but they retired from him, saying, this man is instructed by others, or is a distracted person
44|15|We will take the plague from off you, a little: But ye will certainly return to your infidelity
44|16|On the day whereon We shall fiercely assault them with great power, verily We will take vengeance on them
44|17|We made trial of the people of Pharaoh before them, and an honourable messenger came unto them, saying
44|18|send unto me the servants of God; verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
44|19|And lift not yourselves up against God: For I come unto you with manifest power
44|20|And I fly for protection unto my Lord, and your Lord, that ye stone me not
44|21|If ye do not believe me, at least depart from me
44|22|And when they accused him of imposture, he called upon his Lord, saying, these are a wicked people
44|23|And God said unto him, march forth with my servants by night; for ye will be pursued
44|24|And leave the sea divided, that the Egyptians may enter the same; for they are a host doomed to be drowned
44|25|How many gardens, and fountains
44|26|and fields of corn, and fair dwellings
44|27|and advantages which they enjoyed, did they leave behind them
44|28|Thus We dispossessed them thereof; and We gave the same for an inheritance unto another people
44|29|Neither heaven nor earth wept for them; neither were they respited any longer
44|30|And We delivered the children of Israel from a shameful affliction
44|31|from Pharaoh; for he was haughty, and a transgressor
44|32|And We chose them, knowingly, above all people
44|33|and We shewed them several signs, wherein was an evident trial
44|34|Verily these Meccans say
44|35|assuredly our final end will be no other than our first natural death; neither shall we be raised again
44|36|Bring now our forefathers back to life, if ye speak truth
44|37|Are they better, or the people of Tobba, and those who were before them? We destroyed them, because they wrought wickedness
44|38|We have not created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, by way of sport
44|39|We have created them no otherwise than in truth; but the greater part of them do not understand
44|40|Verily the day of separation shall be the appointed term of them all
44|41|a day, whereon the master and the servant shall be of no advantage to one another, neither shall they be helped
44|42|excepting those on whom God shall have mercy: For He is the mighty, the merciful
44|43|Verily the fruit of the tree of al Zakkum
44|44|shall be the food of the impious
44|45|As the dregs of oil shall it boil in the bellies of the damned
44|46|like the boiling of the hottest water
44|47|And it shall be said to the tormentors, take him, and drag him into the midst of hell
44|48|And pour on his head the torture of boiling water
44|49|saying, taste this; for thou art that mighty and honourable person
44|50|Verily this is the punishment of which ye doubted
44|51|But the pious shall be lodged in a place of security
44|52|among gardens and fountains
44|53|They shall be cloathed in fine silk, and in satin; and they shall sit facing one another
44|54|Thus shall it be: And We will espouse them to fair damsels, having large black eyes
44|55|In that place shall they call for all kinds of fruits, in full security
44|56|They shall not taste death therein, after the first death; and God shall deliver from the pains of hell
44|57|Through the gracious bounty of thy Lord. This will be great felicity
44|58|Moreover We have rendered the Koran easy for thee, by revealing it in thine own tongue: To the end that they may be admonished
44|59|Wherefore do thou wait the event; for they wait to see some misfortune befall thee
45|1|M
45|2|The revelation of this book is from the mighty, the wise God
45|3|Verily both in heaven and earth are signs of the divine power unto the true believers
45|4|And in the creation of yourselves, and of the beasts which are scattered over the face of the earth, are signs unto people of sound judgment
45|5|and also in the vicissitude of night and day, and the rain which God sendeth down from heaven, whereby He quickeneth the earth after it hath been dead: In the change of the winds also are signs, unto people of understanding
45|6|These are the signs of God; We rehearse them unto thee with truth. In what revelation therefore will they believe, after they have rejected God and his signs
45|7|Woe unto every lying, and impious person
45|8|who heareth the signs of God, which are read unto him, and afterwards proudly persisteth in infidelity, as though he heard them not: -- Denounce unto him a painful punishment
45|9|And who, when he cometh to the knowledge of any of our signs, receiveth the same with scorn. For these is prepared a shameful punishment
45|10|Before them lieth hell; and whatever they shall have gained shall not avail them at all, neither shall the idols which they have taken for their patrons, besides God: And they shall suffer a grievous punishment
45|11|This is a true direction; And for those who disbelieve the signs of their Lord, is prepared the punishment of a painful torment
45|12|It is God who hath subjected the sea unto you, that the ships may sail therein, at his command; and that ye may seek advantage unto yourselves by commerce, of his bounty; and that ye may give thanks
45|13|And He obligeth whatever is in heaven and on earth to serve you; the whole being from Him. Verily herein are signs, unto people who consider
45|14|Speak unto the true believers, that they forgive those who hope not for the days of God, that He may reward people according to what they shall have wrought
45|15|Whoso doth that which is right, doth it to the advantage of his own soul; and whoso doth evil, doth it against the same: Hereafter shall ye return unto your Lord
45|16|We gave unto the children of Israel the book of the law, and wisdom, and prophecy; and We fed them with good things, and preferred them above all nations
45|17|And We gave them plain ordinances concerning the business of religion; neither did they fall to variance, except after that knowledge had come unto them, through envy amongst themselves: But thy Lord will decide the controversy between them, on the day of resurrection, concerning that wherein they disagree
45|18|Afterwards We appointed thee, O Mohammed, to promulgate a law concerning the business of religion: Wherefore follow the same, and follow not the desires of those who are ignorant
45|19|Verily they shall not avail thee against God at all: The unjust are the patrons of one another; but God is the patron of the pious
45|20|This Koran delivereth evident precepts unto mankind; and is a direction, and a mercy, unto people who judge aright
45|21|Do the workers of iniquity imagine that We will deal with them as with those who believe and do good works; so that their life and their death shall be equal? An ill judgment do they make
45|22|God hath created the heavens and the earth in truth; that He may recompense every soul according to that which it shall have wrought: And they shall not be treated unjustly
45|23|What thinkest thou? He who taketh his own lust for his God, and whom God causeth knowingly to err, and whose ears, and whose heart He hath sealed up, and over whose eyes He hath cast a veil; who shall direct him, after God shall have forsaken him? Will ye not therefore be admonished
45|24|They say, there is no other life, except our present life: We die, and we live; and nothing but time destroyeth us. But they have no knowledge in this matter; they only follow a vain opinion
45|25|And when our evident signs are rehearsed unto them, their argument which they offer against the same, is no other than that they say, bring to life our fathers who have been dead; if ye speak truth
45|26|Say, God giveth you life; and afterwards causeth you to die: Hereafter will He assemble you together on the day of resurrection; there is no doubt thereof; but the greater part of men do not understand
45|27|Unto God appertaineth the kingdom of heaven and earth; and the day whereon the hour shall be fixed, on that day shall those who charge the Koran with vanity perish
45|28|And thou shalt see every nation kneeling: Every nation shall be called unto its book of account; and it shall be said unto them, this day shall ye be rewarded according to that which ye have wrought
45|29|This our book will speak concerning you with truth: Therein have we written down whatever ye have done
45|30|As to those who shall have believed and done good works, their Lord shall lead them into his mercy: This shall be manifest felicity
45|31|But as to the infidels, it shall be said unto them, Were not my signs rehearsed unto you? But ye proudly rejected them, and became a wicked people
45|32|And when it was said unto you, verily the promise of God is true; and as to the hour of judgment, there is no doubt thereof: Ye answered, we know not what the hour of judgment is: We hold an uncertain opinion only; and we are not well assured of this matter
45|33|But on that day the evils of that which they have wrought, shall appear unto them; and that which they mocked at, shall encompass them
45|34|And it shall be said unto them, this day will We forget you, as ye did forget the meeting of this your day: And your abode shall be hell fire; and ye shall have none to deliver you
45|35|This shall ye suffer, because ye turned the signs of God to ridicule; and the life of the world deceived you. On this day, therefore, they shall not be taken forth from thence, neither shall they be asked any more to render themselves well-pleasing unto God
45|36|Wherefore praise be unto God, the Lord of the heavens, and the Lord of the earth; the Lord of all creatures
45|37|And unto Him be glory in heaven and earth; for He is the mighty, the wise God
46|1|M
46|2|The revelation of this book is from the mighty, the wise God
46|3|We have not created the heavens, and the earth, and whatever is between them, otherwise than in truth, and for a determined period: But the unbelievers turn away from the warning which is given them
46|4|Say, what think ye? Shew me what part of the earth the idols which ye invoke, besides God, have created? Or had they any share in the creation of the heavens? Bring Me a book of scripture revealed before this, or some footstep of ancient knowledge, to countenance your idolatrous practices; if ye are men of veracity
46|5|Who is in a wider error than he who invoketh, besides God, that which cannot return him an answer, to the day of resurrection; and idols which regard not their calling on them
46|6|And which, when men shall be gathered together to judgment, will become their enemies, and will ungratefully deny their worship
46|7|When our evident signs are rehearsed unto them, the unbelievers say of the truth, when it cometh unto them, this is a manifest piece of sorcery
46|8|Will they say, Mohammed hath forged it? Answer, if I have forged it, verily ye shall not obtain for me any favour from God: He well knoweth the injurious language which ye utter concerning it: He is a sufficient witness between me and you; and He is gracious and merciful
46|9|Say, I am not singular among the apostles; neither do I know what will be done with me or with you hereafter: I follow no other than what is revealed unto me; neither am I any more than a public warner
46|10|Say, what is your opinion? If this book be from God, and ye believe not therein; and a witness of the children of Israel bear witness to its consonancy with the law, and believeth therein; and ye proudly reject the same: Are ye not unjust doers? Verily God directeth not unjust people
46|11|But those who believe not, say of the true believers, if the doctrine of the Koran had been good, they had not embraced the same before us. And when they are not guided thereby, they say, this is an antiquated lie
46|12|Whereas the book of Moses was revealed before the Koran, to be a guide and a mercy: And this is a book confirming the same, delivered, in the Arabic tongue; to denounce threats unto those who act unjustly, and to bear good tidings unto the righteous doers
46|13|As to those who say, our Lord is God; and who behave uprightly: On them shall no fear come, neither shall they be grieved
46|14|These shall be the inhabitants of paradise, they shall remain therein for ever: In recompense for that which they have wrought
46|15|We have commanded man to shew kindness to his parents: His mother beareth him in her womb with pain, and bringeth him forth with pain: And the space of his being carried in her womb, and of his weaning, is thirty months; until, when he attaineth his age of strength, and attaineth the age of forty years, he saith, O Lord, excite me, by thy inspiration, that I may be grateful for thy favours, wherewith thou hast favoured me and my parents; and that I may work righteousness, which may please thee: And be gracious unto me in my issue; for I am turned unto thee, and am a Moslem
46|16|These are they from whom We accept the good work which they have wrought, and whose evil works We pass by; and they shall be among the inhabitants of paradise: This is a true promise, which they are promised in this world
46|17|He who saith unto his parents, fie on you! Do ye promise me that I shall be taken forth from the grave, and restored to life; when many generations have passed away before me, and none of them have returned back? And his parents implore God's assistance, and say to their son, alas for thee! Believe: For the promise of God is true. But he answereth, this is no other than silly fables of the ancients
46|18|These are they whom the sentence passed on the nations which have been before them, of genii and of men, justly fitteth: They shall surely perish
46|19|For every one is prepared a certain degree of happiness or misery, according to that which they shall have wrought; that God may recompense them for their works: And they shall not be treated unjustly
46|20|On a certain day, the unbelievers shall be exposed before the fire of hell; and it shall be said unto them, ye received your good things in your life-time, while ye were in the world; and ye enjoyed yourselves therein: Wherefore this day ye shall be rewarded with the punishment of ignominy; for that ye behaved insolently in the earth, without justice, and for that ye transgressed
46|21|Remember the brother of Ad, when he preached unto his people in al Ahkaf, -- and there were preachers before him, and after him, -- saying, worship none but God: Verily I fear for you the punishment of a great day
46|22|They answered, art thou come unto us that thou mayest turn us aside from the worship of our gods? Bring on us now the punishment with which thou threatenest us, if thou art a man of veracity
46|23|He said, verily the knowledge of the time when your punishment will be inflicted, is with God; and I only declare unto you that which I am sent to preach; but I see ye are an ignorant people
46|24|And when they saw the preparation made for their punishment, namely, a cloud traversing the sky, and tending towards their valleys, they said, this is a traversing cloud, which bringeth us rain. Hud answered, nay; it is what ye demanded to be hastened: A wind, wherein is a severe vengeance
46|25|It will destroy every thing, at the command of its Lord. And in the morning nothing was to be seen, besides their empty dwellings. Thus do We reward wicked people
46|26|We had established them in the like flourishing condition wherein We have established you, O men of Mecca; and We had given them ears, and eyes, and hearts: Yet neither their ears, nor their eyes, nor their hearts profited them at all, when they rejected the signs of God; but the vengeance which they mocked at, fell upon them
46|27|We heretofore destroyed the cities which were round about you; and We variously proposed our signs unto them, that they might repent
46|28|Did those protect them, whom they took for gods, besides God, and imagined to be honoured with his familiarity? Nay; they withdrew from them: Yet this was their false opinion which seduced them, and the blasphemy which they had devised
46|29|Remember when We caused certain of the genii to turn aside unto thee, that they might hear the Koran: And when they were present at the reading of the same, they said to one another, give ear: And when it was ended, they returned back unto their people, preaching what they had heard
46|30|They said our people, verily we have heard a book read unto us, which hath been revealed since Moses, confirming the scripture which was delivered before it; and directing unto the truth, and the right way
46|31|Our people, obey God's preacher: And believe in him; that he may forgive you your sins, and may deliver you from a painful punishment
46|32|And whoever obeyeth not God's preacher, shall by no means frustrate God's vengeance on earth: neither shall he have any protectors besides Him. These will be in a manifest error
46|33|Do they not know that God, Who hath created the heavens and the earth, and was not fatigued with the creation thereof, is able to raise the dead to life? Yea verily: For He is almighty
46|34|On a certain day the unbelievers shall be exposed unto hell fire; and it shall be said unto them, is not this really come to pass? They shall answer, yea, by our Lord. God shall reply, taste, therefore, the punishment of hell, for that ye have been unbelievers
46|35|Do thou, O prophet, bear the insults of thy people with patience, as our apostles, who were endued with constancy, bare the injuries of their people: And require not their punishment to be hastened unto them. On the day whereon they shall see the punishment wherewith they have been threatened, it shall seem as though they had tarried in the world but an hour of a day. This is a fair warning. Shall any perish except the people who transgress
47|1|God will render of none effect the works of those who believe not, and who turn away men from the way of God
47|2|But as to those who believe, and work righteousness, and believe in the revelation which hath been sent down unto Mohammed, -- for it is the truth from their Lord, -- He will expiate their evil deeds from them, and will dispose their heart aright
47|3|This will He do, because those who believe not follow vanity, and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus God propoundeth unto men their examples
47|4|When ye encounter the unbelievers, strike off their heads, until ye have made a great slaughter among them; and bind them in bonds: And either give them a free dismission afterwards, or exact a ransom; until the war shall have laid down its arms. This shall ye do: Verily if God pleased, He could take vengeance on them, without your assistance; but He commandeth you to fight his battles, that He may prove the one of you by the other. And as to those who fight in defence of God's true religion, God will not suffer their works to perish
47|5|He will guide them, and will dispose their heart aright
47|6|and He will lead them into paradise, of which He hath told them
47|7|O true believers, if ye assist God, by fighting for his religion, He will assist you against your enemies; and will set your feet fast
47|8|But as for the infidels, let them perish; and their works shall God render vain
47|9|This shall befall them, because they have rejected with abhorrence that which God hath revealed: Wherefore their works shall become of no avail
47|10|Do they not travel through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who were before them? God utterly destroyed them: And the like catastrophe awaiteth the unbelievers
47|11|This shall come to pass, for that God is the patron of the true believers, and for that the infidels have no protector
47|12|Verily God will introduce those who believe, and do good works, into gardens beneath which rivers flow: But the unbelievers indulge themselves in pleasures, and eat as beasts eat; and their abode shall be hell fire
47|13|How many cities were more mighty in strength than thy city which hath expelled thee; yet have We destroyed them, and there was none to help them
47|14|Shall he, therefore, who followeth the plain declaration of his Lord, be as he whose evil works have been dressed up for him by the devil; and who follow their own lusts
47|15|The description of paradise, which is promised unto the pious: Therein are rivers of incorruptible water; and rivers of milk, the taste whereof changeth not; and rivers of wine, pleasant unto those who drink; and rivers of clarified honey: And therein shall they have plenty of all kinds of fruits; and pardon from their Lord. Shall the man for whom these things are prepared, be as he who must dwell for ever in hell fire; and will have the boiling water given them to drink, which shall burst their bowels
47|16|Of the unbelievers there are some who give ear unto thee, until, when they go out from thee, they say, by way of derision, unto those to whom knowledge hath been given, what hath he said now? These are they whose hearts God hath sealed up, and who follow their own lusts
47|17|But as to those who are directed, God will grant them a more ample direction, and He will instruct them what to avoid
47|18|Do the infidels wait for any other than the last hour, that it may come upon them suddenly? Some signs thereof are already come: And when it shall actually overtake them, how can they then receive admonition
47|19|Know, therefore, that there is no god but God: And ask pardon for thy sin, and for the true believers both men and women. God knoweth your busy employment in the world, and the place of your abode hereafter
47|20|The true believers say, hath not a sura been revealed commanding war against the infidels? But when a sura without any ambiguity is revealed, and war is mentioned therein, thou mayest see those in whose hearts is an infirmity, look towards thee with the look of one whom death overshadoweth
47|21|But obedience would be more eligible for them, and to speak that which is convenient. And when the command is firmly established, if they give credit unto God, it will be better for them
47|22|Were ye ready therefore, if ye had been put in authority, to commit outrages in the earth, and to violate your ties of blood
47|23|These are they whom God hath cursed, and hath rendered deaf, and whose eyes He hath blinded
47|24|Do they not therefore attentively meditate on the Koran? Are there locks upon their hearts
47|25|Verily they who turn their backs, after the true direction is made manifest unto them; Satan shall prepare their wickedness for them, and God shall bear with them for a time
47|26|This shall befall them, because they say privately unto those who detest what God hath revealed, we will obey you in part of the matter. But God knoweth their secrets
47|27|How therefore will it be with them, when the angels shall cause them to die, and shall strike their faces, and their backs
47|28|This shall they suffer, because they follow that which provoketh God to wrath, and are averse to what is well pleasing unto Him: And He will render their works vain
47|29|Do they in whose hearts is an infirmity, imagine that God will not bring their malice to light
47|30|If We pleased, We could surely shew them unto thee, and thou shouldest know them by their marks; but thou shalt certainly know them by their perverse pronunciation of their words. God knoweth your actions
47|31|And We will try you, until We know those among you who fight valiantly, and who persevere with constancy; and We will try the reports of your behaviour
47|32|Verily those who believe not, and turn away men from the way of God, and make opposition against the apostle, after the divine direction hath been manifested unto them, shall not hurt God at all; but He shall make their works to perish
47|33|O true believers, obey God; and obey the apostle: And render not your works of no effect
47|34|Verily those who believe not, and who turn away men from the way of God, and then die, being unbelievers, God will by no means forgive
47|35|Faint not therefore, neither invite your enemies to peace, while ye are the superior: For God is with you, and will not defraud you of the merit of your works
47|36|Verily this present life is only a play and a vain amusement: But if ye believe, and fear God, He will give you your rewards. He doth not require of you your whole substance
47|37|If He should require the whole of you, and earnestly press you, ye would become niggardly, and it would raise your hatred against his apostle
47|38|Behold, ye are those who are invited to expend part of your substance for the support of God's true religion; and there are some of you who are niggardly. But whoever shall be niggardly, shall be niggardly towards his own soul: For God wanteth nothing, but ye are needy: And if ye turn back, He will substitute another people in your stead, who shall not be like unto you
48|1|Verily We have granted thee a manifest victory
48|2|That God may forgive thee thy preceding and thy subsequent sin, and may complete his favour on thee, and direct thee in the right way
48|3|and that God may assist thee with a glorious assistance
48|4|It is He who sendeth down secure tranquillity into the hearts of the true believers, that they may increase in faith, beyond their former faith: -- The hosts of heaven and earth are God's; and God is knowing and wise
48|5|That He may lead the true believers of both sexes into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever; and may expiate their evil deeds from them: -- This will be great felicity with God
48|6|And that He may punish the hypocritical men, and the hypocritical women, and the idolaters, and the idolatresses, who conceive an ill opinion of God. They shall experience a turn of evil fortune; and God shall be angry with them, and shall curse them, and hath prepared hell for them; an ill journey shall it be thither
48|7|Unto God belong the hosts of heaven and earth; and God is mighty and wise
48|8|Verily We have sent thee to be a witness and a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats
48|9|that ye may believe in God, and his apostle; and may assist Him, and revere Him, and praise Him morning and evening
48|10|Verily they who swear fealty unto thee, swear fealty unto God: The hand of God is over their hands. Whoever shall violate his oath, will violate the same to the hurt only of his own soul: But whoever shall perform that which he hath covenanted with God, He will surely give him a great reward
48|11|The Arabs of the desert who were left behind will say unto thee, our substance and our families employed us, so that we went not forth with thee to war; wherefore ask pardon for us. They speak that with their tongues, which is not in their hearts. Answer, who shall be able to obtain for you any thing from God to the contrary, if he is pleased to afflict you, or is pleased to be gracious unto you? Yea verily, God is well acquainted with that which ye do
48|12|Truly ye imagined that the apostle and the true believers would never return to their families; and this was prepared in your hearts: But ye imagined an evil imagination; and ye are a corrupt people
48|13|Whoso believeth not in God and his apostle, verily We have prepared burning fire for the unbelievers
48|14|Unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth: He forgiveth whom He pleaseth, and He punisheth whom He pleaseth; and God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
48|15|Those who were left behind will say, when ye go forth to take the spoil, suffer us to follow you. They seek to change the word of God. Say, ye shall by no means follow us: Thus hath God said heretofore. They will reply, nay; ye envy us a share of the booty. But they are men of small understanding
48|16|Say unto the Arabs of the desert who were left behind, ye shall be called forth against a mighty and a warlike nation: Ye shall fight against them, or they shall profess Islam. If ye obey, God will give you a glorious reward: But if ye turn back, as ye turned back heretofore, He will chastise you with a grievous chastisement
48|17|It shall be no crime in the blind, neither shall it be a crime in the lame, neither shall it be a crime in the sick, if they go not forth to war: And whoso shall obey God and his apostle, he shall lead him into gardens beneath which rivers flow; but whoso shall turn back, He will chastise him with a grievous chastisement
48|18|Now God was well pleased with the true believers, when they sware fidelity unto thee under the tree; and He knew that which was in their hearts: Wherefore He sent down on them tranquillity of mind, and rewarded them with a speedy victory
48|19|and many spoils which they took: For God is mighty and wise
48|20|God promised you many spoils which ye should take; but He gave you these by way of earnest: And He restrained the hands of men from you: That the same may be a sign unto the true believers; and that He may guide you into the right way
48|21|And He also promiseth you other spoils, which ye have not yet been able to take: But now hath God encompassed them for you; and God is almighty
48|22|If the unbelieving Meccans had fought against you, verily they had turned their backs; and they would not have found a patron or protector
48|23|According to the ordinance of God, which hath been put in execution heretofore against opposers of the prophets; for thou shalt not find any change in the ordinance of God
48|24|It was He who restrained their hands from you, and your hands from them, in the valley of Mecca; after that He had given you the victory over them: And God saw that which ye did
48|25|These are they who believed not, and hindered you from visiting the holy temple, and also hindered the offering, being detained, that it should not arrive at the place where it ought to be sacrificed. Had it not been that ye might have trampled on divers true believers, both men and women, whom ye knew not, being promiscuously assembled with the infidels, and that a crime might therefore have lighted on you on their account, without your knowledge, He had not restrained your hands from them: But this was done, that God might lead whom He pleaseth into his mercy. If they had been distinguished from one another, we had surely chastised such of them as believed not, with a severe chastisement
48|26|When the unbelievers had put in their hearts an affected preciseness, the preciseness of ignorance, and God sent down his tranquillity on his apostle and on the true believers; and firmly fixed in them the word of piety, and they were the most worthy of the same, and the most deserving thereof: For God knoweth all things
48|27|Now hath God in truth verified unto his apostle the vision, wherein He said; ye shall surely enter the holy temple of Mecca, if God please, in full security; having your heads shaved, and your hair cut: Ye shall not fear: For God knoweth that which ye know not; and He hath appointed you, besides this, a speedy victory
48|28|It is He who hath sent his apostle with the direction, and the religion of truth; that He may exalt the same above every religion: And God is a sufficient witness hereof
48|29|Mohammed is the apostle of God: And those who are with him are fierce against the unbelievers, but compassionate towards one another. Thou mayest see them bowing down, prostrate, seeking a recompense from God, and his good will. Their signs are in their faces, being marks of frequent prostration. This is their description in the pentateuch, and their description in the gospel: They are as seed which putteth forth its stalk, and strengtheneth it, and swelleth in the ear, and riseth upon its stem; giving delight unto the sower. Such are the Moslems described to be: That the infidels may swell with indignation at them. God hath promised unto such of them as believe, and do good works, pardon and a great reward
49|1|O true believers, anticipate not any matter in the sight of God and his apostle: And fear God; for God both heareth and knoweth
49|2|O true believers, raise not your voices above the voice of the prophet; neither speak loud unto him in discourse, as ye speak loud unto one another, lest your works become vain, and ye perceive it not
49|3|Verily they who lower their voices in the presence of the apostle of God, are those whose hearts God hath disposed unto piety: They shall obtain pardon, and a great reward
49|4|As to those who call unto thee from without the inner apartments, the greater part of them do not understand the respect due to thee
49|5|If they wait with patience, until thou come forth unto them, it will certainly be better for them: But God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
49|6|O true believers, if a wicked man come unto you with a tale, inquire strictly into the truth thereof; lest ye hurt people through ignorance, and afterwards repent of what ye have done
49|7|And know that the apostle of God is among you: If he should obey you in many things, ye would certainly be guilty of a crime, in leading him into a mistake. But God hath made the faith amiable unto you, and hath prepared the same in your hearts; and hath rendered infidelity, and iniquity, and disobedience hateful unto you. These are they who walk in the right way
49|8|through mercy from God, and grace: And God is knowing, and wise
49|9|If two parties of the believers contend with one another, do ye endavour to compose the matter between them: And if the one of them offer an insult unto the other, fight against that party which offered the insult, until they return unto the judgment of God; and if they do return, make peace between them with equity: And act with justice; for God loveth those who act justly
49|10|Verily the true believers are brethren: Wherefore reconcile your brethren; and fear God, that ye may obtain mercy
49|11|O true believers, let not men laugh other men to scorn; who peradventure may be better than themselves: Neither let women laugh other women to scorn; who may possibly be better than themselves. Neither defame one another; nor call one another by opprobrious appellations. An ill name it is to be charged with wickedness, after having embraced the faith: And whoso repenteth not, they will be the unjust doers
49|12|O true believers, carefully avoid entertaining a suspicion of another: For some suspicions are a crime. Inquire not too curiously into other mens failings: Neither let the one of you speak ill of another in his abscence. Would any of you desire to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Surely ye would abhor it. And fear God: For God is easy to be reconciled, and merciful
49|13|O men, verily We have created you of a male and a female; and We have distributed you into nations, and tribes, that ye might know one another. Verily the most honourable of you, in the sight of God, is the most pious of you: And God is wise and knowing
49|14|The Arabs of the desert say, we believe. Answer, ye do by no means believe; but say, we have embraced Islam: For the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts. If ye obey God and his apostle, He will not defraud you of any part of the merit of your works: For God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
49|15|Verily the true believers are those only who believe in God and his apostle, and afterwards doubt not; and who employ their substance and their persons in the defence of God's true religion: These are they who speak sincerely
49|16|Say, will ye inform God concerning your religion? But God knoweth whatever is in heaven and in earth: For God is omniscient
49|17|They upbraid thee that they have embraced Islam. Answer, upbraid me not with your having embraced Islam: Rather God upbraideth you, that He hath directed you to the faith; if ye speak sincerely
49|18|Verily God knoweth the secrets of heaven and earth: And God beholdeth that which ye do
50|1|By the glorious Koran
50|2|Verily they wonder that a preacher from among themselves is come unto them; and the unbelievers say, this is a wonderful thing
50|3|After we shall be dead, and become dust, shall we return to life? This is a return remote from thought
50|4|Now We know what the earth consumeth of them; and with Us is a book which keepeth an account thereof
50|5|But they charge falsehood on the truth, after it hath come unto them: Wherefore they are plunged in a confused business
50|6|Do they not look up to the heaven above them, and consider how We have raised it and adorned it; and that there are no flaws therein
50|7|We have also spread forth the earth, and thrown thereon mountains firmly rooted: And We cause every beautiful kind of vegetables to spring up therein
50|8|for a subject of meditation, and an admonition unto every man who turneth unto Us
50|9|And We send down rain as a blessing from heaven, whereby We cause gardens to spring forth, and the grain of harvest
50|10|and tall palm-trees having branches laden with dates hanging one above another
50|11|as a provision for mankind; and We thereby quicken a dead country: So shall be the coming forth of the dead from their graves
50|12|The people of Noah, and those who dwelt at Al Rass, and Thamud, and Ad, and Pharaoh accused the prophets of imposture before the Meccans
50|13|and also the brethren of Lot
50|14|and the inhabitants of the wood near Midian, and the people of Tobba: All these accused the apostles of imposture; wherefore the judgments which I threatened were justly inflicted on them
50|15|Is our power exhausted by the first creation? Yea; they are in a perplexity, because of a new creation which is foretold them, namely, the raising of the dead
50|16|We created man, and We know what his soul whispereth within him; and We are nearer unto him than his jugular vein
50|17|When the two angels deputed to take account of a man's behaviour, take an account thereof; one sitting on the right hand, and the other on the left
50|18|He uttereth not a word, but there is with him a watcher, ready to note it
50|19|And the agony of death shall come in truth: This, O man, is what thou soughtest to avoid
50|20|And the trumpet shall sound: This will be the day which hath been threatened
50|21|And every soul shall come; and therewith shall be a driver and a witness
50|22|And the former shall say unto the unbeliever, thou wast negligent heretofore of this day: But we have removed thy veil from off thee; and thy sight is become piercing this day
50|23|And his companion shall say, this is what is ready with me to be attested
50|24|And God shall say, cast into hell every unbeliever, and perverse person
50|25|and every one who forbad good, and every transgressor, and doubter of the faith
50|26|who set up another god with the true God; and cast him into a grievous torment
50|27|His companion shall say, O Lord, I did not seduce him; but he was in a wide error
50|28|God shall say, wrangle not in my presence: Since I threatened you before hand with the torments which ye now see prepared for you
50|29|The sentence is not changed with me: Neither do I treat my servants unjustly
50|30|On that day We will say unto hell, art thou full? And it shall answer, is there yet any addition
50|31|And paradise shall be brought near unto the pious
50|32|and it shall be said unto them, this is what ye have been promised; unto every one who turned himself unto God, and kept his commandments
50|33|who feared the Merciful in secret, and came unto Him with a converted heart
50|34|Enter the same in peace: This is the day of eternity
50|35|Therein shall they have whatever they shall desire; and there will be a superabundant addition of bliss with Us
50|36|How many generations have We destroyed before the Meccans, which were more mighty than they in strength? Pass, therefore, through the regions of the earth, and see whether there be any refuge from our vengeance
50|37|Verily herein is an admonition unto him who hath a heart to understand, or giveth ear, and is present with an attentive mind
50|38|We created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, in six days; and no weariness affected us
50|39|Wherefore patiently suffer what they say; and celebrate the praise of thy Lord before sun-rise, and before sun-set
50|40|and praise Him in some part of the night: And perform the additional parts of worship
50|41|And hearken unto the day whereon the cryer shall call men to judgment from a near place
50|42|The day whereon they shall hear the voice of the trumpet in truth: This will be the day of mens coming forth from their graves
50|43|We give life, and We cause to die; and unto Us shall be the return of all creatures
50|44|The day whereon the earth shall suddenly cleave in sunder over them. This will be an assembly easy for us to assemble
50|45|We well know what the unbelievers say; and thou art not sent to compel them forcibly to the faith. Wherefore warn, by the Koran, him who feareth my threatening
51|1|By the winds dispersing and scattering the dust
51|2|and by the clouds bearing a load of rain
51|3|by the ships running swiftly in the sea
51|4|and by the angels who distribute things necessary for the support of all creatures
51|5|Verily that wherewith ye are threatened is certainly true
51|6|and the last judgment will surely come
51|7|By the heaven furnished with paths
51|8|ye widely differ in what ye say
51|9|He will be turned aside from the faith, who shall be turned aside by the divine decree
51|10|Cursed be the liars
51|11|who wade in deep waters of ignorance, neglecting their salvation
51|12|They ask, when will the day of judgment come
51|13|On that day shall they be burned in hell fire
51|14|and it shall be said unto them, taste your punishment; this is what ye demanded to be hastened
51|15|But the pious shall dwell among gardens and fountains
51|16|receiving that which their Lord shall give them; because they were righteous doers before this day
51|17|They slept but a small part of the night
51|18|and early in the morning they asked pardon of God
51|19|And a due portion of their wealth was given unto him who asked, and unto him who was forbidden by shame to ask
51|20|There are signs of the divine power and goodness in the earth, unto men of sound understanding
51|21|and also in your own selves: Will ye not therefore consider
51|22|Your sustenance is in the heaven; and also that which ye are promised
51|23|Wherefore by the Lord of heaven and earth I swear that this is certainly the truth; according to what yourselves speak
51|24|Hath not the story of Abraham's honoured guests come to thy knowledge
51|25|When they went in unto him, and said, peace: He answered, peace; saying within himself, these are unknown people
51|26|And he went privately unto his family, and brought a fatted calf
51|27|And he set it before them, and when he saw they touched it not, he said, do ye not eat
51|28|And he began to entertain a fear of them. They said, fear not: And they declared unto him the promise of a wise youth
51|29|And his wife drew near with exclamation, and she smote her face, and said, I am an old woman, and barren
51|30|The angels answered, thus saith thy Lord: Verily He is the wise, the knowing
51|31|And Abraham said unto them, what is your errand, therefore O messengers of God
51|32|They answered, verily we are sent unto a wicked people
51|33|That we may send down upon them stones of baked clay
51|34|marked from thy Lord, for the destruction of transgressors
51|35|And we brought forth the true believers who were in the city
51|36|But we found not therein more than one family of Moslems
51|37|And we overthrew the same, and left a sign therein unto those who dread the severe chastisement of God
51|38|In Moses also was a sign: When We sent him unto Pharaoh with manifest power
51|39|But he turned back, with his princes, saying, this man is a sorcerer, or a madman
51|40|Wherefore We took him and his forces, and cast them into the sea: And he was one worthy of reprehension
51|41|And in the tribe of Ad also was a sign: When We sent against them a destroying wind
51|42|it touched not ought, whereon it came, but it rendered the same as a thing rotten and reduced to dust
51|43|In Thamud likewise was a sign: When it was said unto them, enjoy yourselves for a time
51|44|But they insolently transgressed the command of their Lord: Wherefore a terrible noise from heaven assailed them, while they looked on
51|45|and they were not able to stand on their feet, neither did they save themselves from destruction
51|46|And the people of Noah did We destroy before these: For they were a people who enormously transgressed
51|47|We have built the heaven with might; and We have given it a large extent
51|48|And We have stretched forth the earth beneath; and how evenly have We spread the same
51|49|And of every thing have We created two kinds, that peradventure ye may consider
51|50|Fly, therefore, unto God; verily I am a public warner unto you, from Him
51|51|And set not up another god with the true God: Verily I am a public warner unto you, from Him
51|52|In like manner there came no apostle unto their predecessors, but they said, this man is a magician, or a madman
51|53|Have they bequeathed this behaviour successively the one to the other? Yea; they are a people who enormously transgress
51|54|Wherefore withdraw from them; and thou shalt not be blameworthy in so doing
51|55|Yet continue to admonish: For admonition profiteth the true believers
51|56|I have not created genii and men for any other end than that they should serve Me
51|57|I require not any sustenance from them; neither will I that they feed Me
51|58|Verily God is He who provideth for all creatures; possessed of mighty power
51|59|Unto those who shall injure our apostle shall be given a portion like unto the portion of those who behaved like them in times past; and they shall not wish the same to be hastened
51|60|Woe, therefore, to the unbelievers, because of their day with which they are threatened
52|1|By the mountain of Sinai
52|2|and by the book written
52|3|in an expanded scroll
52|4|and by the visited house
52|5|and by the elevated roof of heaven
52|6|and by the swelling ocean
52|7|Verily the punishment of thy Lord will surely descend
52|8|there shall be none to withhold it
52|9|On that day the heaven shall be shaken, and shall reel
52|10|and the mountains shall walk and pass away
52|11|And on that day woe be unto those who accused God's apostles of imposture
52|12|who amused themselves in wading in vain disputes
52|13|On that day shall they be driven and thrust into the fire of hell
52|14|and it shall be said unto them, this is the fire which ye denied as a fiction
52|15|Is this a magic illusion? Or do ye not see
52|16|Enter the same to be scorched: Whether ye bear your torments patiently, or impatiently, it will be equal unto you: Ye shall surely receive the reward of that which ye have wrought
52|17|But the pious shall dwell amidst gardens and pleasures
52|18|delighting themselves in what their Lord shall have given them: And their Lord shall deliver them from the pains of hell
52|19|And it shall be said unto them, eat and drink with easy digestion; because of that which ye have wrought
52|20|Leaning on couches disposed in order: And We will espouse them unto virgins having large black eyes
52|21|And unto those who believe, and whose off-spring follow them in the faith, We will join their off-spring in paradise: And We will not diminish unto them ought of the merit of their works. -- Every man is given in pledge for that which he shall have wrought
52|22|And we will give them fruits in abundance, and flesh of the kinds which they shall desire
52|23|They shall present unto one another therein a cup of wine, wherein there shall be no vain discourse, nor any incitement unto wickedness
52|24|And youths appointed to attend them, shall go round them: Beautiful as pearls hidden in their shell
52|25|And they shall approach unto one another, and shall ask mutual questions
52|26|And they shall say, verily we were heretofore amidst our family, in great dread with regard to our state after death
52|27|But God hath been gracious unto us, and hath delivered us from the pain of burning fire
52|28|For we called on him heretofore; and he is the beneficent, the merciful
52|29|Wherefore do thou, O prophet, admonish thy people. Thou art not, by the grace of thy Lord, a soothsayer, or a madman
52|30|Do they say, he is a poet: We wait, concerning him, some adverse turn of fortune
52|31|Say, wait ye my ruin: Verily I wait, with you, the time of your destruction
52|32|Do their mature understandings bid them say this; or are they people who perversely transgress
52|33|Do they say, he hath forged the Koran? Verily they believe not
52|34|Let them produce a discourse like unto it, if they speak truth
52|35|Were they created by nothing; or were they the creators of themselves
52|36|Did they create the heavens and the earth? Verily they are not firmly persuaded that God hath created them
52|37|Are the stores of thy Lord in their hands? Are they the supreme dispensers of all things
52|38|Have they a ladder, whereby they may ascend to heaven, and hear the discourses of the angels? Let one, therefore, who hath heard them, produce an evident proof thereof
52|39|Hath God daughters, and have ye sons
52|40|Dost thou ask them a reward for thy preaching? But they are laden with debts
52|41|Are the secrets of futurity with them; and do they transcribe the same from the table of God's decrees
52|42|Do they seek to lay a plot against thee? But the unbelievers are they who shall be circumvented
52|43|Have they any god, besides God? Far be God exalted above the idols which they associate with Him
52|44|If they should see a fragment of the heaven falling down upon them, they would say, it is only a thick cloud
52|45|Wherefore leave them, until they arrive at their day wherein they shall swoon for fear
52|46|A day, in which their subtle contrivances shall not avail them at all, neither shall they be protected
52|47|And those who act unjustly shall surely suffer another punishment besides this: But the greater part of them do not understand
52|48|And wait thou patiently the judgment of thy Lord concerning them; for thou art in our eye: And celebrate the praise of thy Lord, when thou risest up
52|49|and praise Him in the night-season, and when the stars begin to disappear
53|1|By the star, when it setteth
53|2|your companion Mohammed erreth not, nor is he led astray
53|3|Neither doth he speak of his own will
53|4|It is no other than a revelation, which hath been revealed unto him
53|5|One mighty in power, indued with understanding, taught it him
53|6|And He appeared
53|7|in the highest part of the horizon
53|8|Afterwards He approached the prophet, and drew near unto him
53|9|until He was at the distance of two bows length from him, or yet nearer
53|10|And He revealed unto his servant that which He revealed
53|11|The heart of Mohammed did not falsely represent that which he saw
53|12|Will ye therefore dispute with him concerning that which he saw
53|13|He also saw him another time
53|14|by the lote-tree beyond which there is no passing
53|15|Near it is the garden of eternal abode
53|16|When the lote-tree covered that which it covered
53|17|his eye-sight turned not aside, neither did it wander
53|18|And he really beheld some of the greatest signs of his Lord
53|19|What think ye of Allat, and Al Uzza
53|20|and Manah, that other third goddess
53|21|Have ye male children, and God female
53|22|This, therefore, is an unjust partition
53|23|They are no other than empty names, which ye and your fathers have named goddesses. God hath not revealed concerning them any thing to authorize their worship. They follow no other than a vain opinion, and what their souls desire: Yet hath the true direction come unto them from their Lord
53|24|Shall man have whatever he wisheth for
53|25|The life to come, and the present life are God's
53|26|And how many angels soever there be in the heavens, their intercession shall be of no avail, until after God shall have granted permission unto whom He shall please and shall accept
53|27|Verily they who believe not in the life to come give unto the angels a female appellation
53|28|But they have no knowledge herein: They follow no other than a bare opinion; and a bare opinion attaineth not any thing of truth
53|29|Wherefore withdraw from him who turneth away from our admonition, and seeketh only the present life
53|30|This is their highest pitch of knowledge. Verily thy Lord well knoweth him who erreth from his way; and He well knoweth him who is rightly directed
53|31|Unto God belongeth whatever is in heaven and earth: That He may reward those who do evil, according to that which they shall have wrought; and may reward those who do well, with the most excellent reward
53|32|As to those who avoid great crimes, and hainous sins, and are guilty only of lighter faults; verily thy Lord will be extensive in mercy towards them. He well knew you when He produced you out of the earth, and when ye were embryo's in your mothers' wombs: Wherefore justify not your selves: He best knoweth the man who feareth Him
53|33|What thinkest thou of him who turneth aside from following the truth
53|34|and giveth little, and covetously stoppeth his hand
53|35|Is the knowledge of futurity with him, so that he seeth the same
53|36|hath he not been informed of that which is contained in the books of Moses
53|37|and of Abraham who faithfully performed his engagements
53|38|To wit: That a burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another
53|39|and that nothing shall be imputed to a man for righteousness, except his own labour
53|40|and that his labour shall surely be made manifest hereafter
53|41|and that he shall be rewarded for the same with a most abundant reward
53|42|and that unto thy Lord will be the end of all things
53|43|and that He causeth to laugh, and causeth to weep
53|44|and that He putteth to death, and giveth life
53|45|and that He createth the two sexes, the male and the female
53|46|of seed when it is emitted
53|47|and that unto Him appertaineth another production, namely, the raising of the dead again to life hereafter
53|48|and that He enricheth, and causeth to acquire possessions
53|49|and that He is the Lord of the dog-star
53|50|and that He destroyed the ancient tribe of Ad
53|51|and Thamud, and left not any of them alive
53|52|and also the people of Noah, before them; for they were most unjust and wicked
53|53|And He overthrew the cities which were turned upside down
53|54|and that which covered them, covered them
53|55|Which, therefore, of thy Lord's benefits, O man, wilt thou call in question
53|56|This our apostle is a preacher like the preachers who preceded him
53|57|The approaching day of judgment draweth near
53|58|There is none who can reveal the exact time of the same, besides God
53|59|Do ye, therefore, wonder at this new revelation
53|60|and do ye laugh, and not weep
53|61|spending your time in idle diversions
53|62|But rather worship God, and serve him
54|1|The hour of judgment approacheth; and the moon hath been split in sunder
54|2|But if the unbelievers see a sign, they turn aside, saying, this is a powerful charm
54|3|And they accuse thee, O Mohammed, of imposture, and follow their own lusts: But every thing will be immutably fixed
54|4|And now hath a message come unto them, wherein is a determent from obstinate infidelity
54|5|the same being consummate wisdom: But warners profit them not
54|6|wherefore do thou withdraw from them. The day whereon the summoner shall summon mankind to an ungrateful business
54|7|they shall come forth from their graves with down-cast looks: Numerous as locusts scattered far abroad
54|8|hastening with terror unto the summoner. The unbelievers shall say, this is a day of distress
54|9|The people of Noah accused that prophet of imposture, before thy people rejected thee: They accused our servant of imposture, saying, he is a madman; and he was rejected with reproach
54|10|He called, therefore, upon his Lord, saying, verily I am overpowered; wherefore avenge me
54|11|So We opened the gates of heaven, with water pouring down
54|12|and We caused the earth to break forth into springs; so that the water of heaven and earth met, according to the decree which had been established
54|13|And We bare him on a vessel composed of planks and nails
54|14|which moved forward under our eyes: As a recompense unto him who had been ungratefully rejected
54|15|And We left the said vessel for a sign: But is any one warned thereby
54|16|And how severe was my vengeance, and my threatening
54|17|Now have We made the Koran easy for admoniton: But is any one admonished thereby
54|18|Ad charged their prophet with imposture: But how severe was my vengeance, and my threatening
54|19|Verily We sent against them a roaring wind, on a day of continued ill-luck
54|20|It carried men away, as though they had been roots of palm-trees forcibly torn up
54|21|And how severe was my vengeance, and my threatening
54|22|Now have We made the Koran easy for admonition: But is any one admonished thereby
54|23|Thamud charged the admonitions of their prophet with falsehood
54|24|and said, shall we follow a single man among us? Verily we should then be guilty of error, and preposterous madness
54|25|Is the office of admonition committed unto him preferably to the rest of us? Nay; he is a liar, and an insolent fellow
54|26|But God said to Saleh, to morrow shall they know who is the liar, and the insolent person
54|27|For We will surely send the she-camel for a trial of them; and do thou observe them, and bear their insults with patience
54|28|And prophesy unto them that the water shall be divided between them, and each portion shall be sat down to alternately
54|29|And they called their companion: And he took a sword, and slew her
54|30|But how severe was my vengeance, and my threatening
54|31|For We sent against them one cry of the angel Gabriel, and they became like the dry sticks used by him who buildeth a fold for cattle
54|32|And now have We made the Koran easy for admonition: But is any one admonished thereby
54|33|The people of Lot charged his preaching with falsehood
54|34|But We sent against them a wind driving a shower of stones, which destroyed them all except the family of Lot; whom We delivered early in the morning
54|35|through favour from Us. Thus do We reward those who are thankful
54|36|And Lot had warned them of our severity in chastising; but they doubted of that warning
54|37|And they demanded his guests of him, that they might abuse them: But We put out their eyes, saying, taste my vengeance, and my threatening
54|38|And early in the morning a lasting punishment surprized them
54|39|Taste, therefore, my vengeance, and my threatening
54|40|Now have We made the Koran easy for admonition: But is any one admonished thereby
54|41|The warning of Moses also came unto the people of Pharaoh
54|42|but they charged every one of our signs with imposture: Wherefore We chastised them with a mighty and irresistible chastisement
54|43|Are your unbelievers, O Meccans, better than these? Is immunity from punishment promised unto you in the scriptures
54|44|Do they say, we are a body of men able to prevail against our enemies
54|45|The multitude shall surely be put to flight, and shall turn their back
54|46|But the hour of judgment is their threatened time of punishment: And that hour shall be more grievous and more bitter than their afflictions in this life
54|47|Verily the wicked wander in error, and shall be tormented hereafter in burning flames
54|48|On that day they shall be dragged into the fire on their faces; and it shall be said unto them, taste ye the touch of hell
54|49|All things have We created bound by a fixed decree
54|50|And our command is no more than a single word, like the twinkling of an eye
54|51|We have formerly destroyed nations like unto you; but is any of you warned by their example
54|52|Every thing which they do is recorded in the books kept by the guardian angels
54|53|And every action, both small and great, is written down in the preserved table
54|54|Moreover the pious shall dwell among gardens and rivers
54|55|in the assembly of truth, in the presence of a most potent king
55|1|The Merciful
55|2|hath taught his servant the Koran
55|3|He created man
55|4|He hath taught him distinct speech
55|5|The sun and the moon run their courses according to a certain rule
55|6|And the vegetables which creep on the ground, and the trees submit to his disposition
55|7|He also raised the heaven; and He appointed the balance
55|8|that ye should not transgress in respect to the balance
55|9|Wherefore observe a just weight; and diminish not the balance
55|10|And the earth hath He prepared for living creatures
55|11|Therein are various fruits, and palm-trees bearing sheaths of flowers
55|12|and grain having chaff, and leaves
55|13|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|14|He created man of dried clay like an earthen vessel
55|15|But He created the genii of fire clear from smoke
55|16|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|17|He is the Lord of the east, and the Lord of the west
55|18|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|19|He hath let loose the two seas, that they meet each another
55|20|Between them is placed a bar which they cannot pass
55|21|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|22|From them are taken forth unions and lesser pearls
55|23|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|24|His also are the ships, carrying their sails aloft in the sea, like mountains
55|25|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|26|Every creature which liveth on the earth is subject to decay
55|27|But the glorious and honourable countenance of thy Lord shall remain for ever
55|28|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|29|Unto him do all creatures which are in heaven and earth make petition: Every day is He employed in some new work
55|30|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|31|We will surely attend to judge you, O men and genii, at the last day
55|32|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|33|O ye collective body of genii and men, if ye be able to pass out of the confines of heaven and earth, pass forth: Ye shall not pass forth but by absolute power
55|34|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|35|A flame of fire without smoke, and a smoke without flame shall be sent down upon you; and ye shall not be able to defend yourselves therefrom
55|36|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|37|And when the heaven shall be rent in sunder, and shall become red as a rose, and shall melt like ointment
55|38|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|39|On that day neither man nor genius shall be asked concerning his sin
55|40|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|41|The wicked shall be known by their marks; and they shall be taken by the forelocks, and the feet, and shall be cast into hell
55|42|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|43|This is hell, which the wicked deny as a falsehood
55|44|They shall pass to and fro between the same and hot boiling water
55|45|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|46|But for him who dreadeth the tribunal of his Lord, are prepared two gardens
55|47|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|48|Planted with shady trees
55|49|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|50|In each of them shall be two fountains flowing
55|51|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|52|In each of them shall there be of every fruit two kinds
55|53|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|54|They shall repose on couches, the linings whereof shall be of thick silk interwoven with gold: And the fruit of the two gardens shall be near at hand to gather
55|55|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|56|Therein shall receive them beauteous damsels, refraining their eyes from beholding any besides their spouses: Whom no man shall have deflowered before them, neither any genius
55|57|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|58|Having complexions like rubies and pearls
55|59|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|60|Shall the reward of good works be any other than good
55|61|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|62|And besides these there shall be two other gardens
55|63|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|64|Of a dark green
55|65|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|66|In each of them shall be two fountains pouring forth plenty of water
55|67|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|68|In each of them shall be fruits, and palm-trees, and pomegranates
55|69|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|70|Therein shall be agreeable and beauteous damsels
55|71|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|72|Having fine black eyes; and kept in pavilions from public view
55|73|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|74|Whom no man shall have deflowered, before their destined spouses, nor any genius
55|75|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|76|Therein shall they delight themselves, lying on green cushions and beautiful carpets
55|77|Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
55|78|Blessed be the name of thy Lord, possessed of glory and honour
56|1|When the inevitable day of judgment shall suddenly come
56|2|no soul shall charge the prediction of its coming with falsehood
56|3|It will abase some, and exalt others
56|4|When the earth shall be shaken with a violent shock
56|5|and the mountains shall be dashed in pieces
56|6|and shall become as dust scattered abroad
56|7|and ye shall be separated into three distinct classes
56|8|The companions of the right hand; -- how happy shall the companions of the right hand be
56|9|And the companions of the left hand; -- how miserable shall the companions of the left hand be
56|10|And those who have preceded others in the faith, shall precede them to paradise
56|11|These are they who shall approach near unto God
56|12|They shall dwell in gardens of delight
56|13|A [large] company of the former peoples
56|14|and few of the last
56|15|Reposing on couches adorned with gold and precious stones
56|16|sitting opposite to one another thereon
56|17|Youths which shall continue in their bloom for ever, shall go round about to attend them
56|18|with goblets, and beakers, and a cup of flowing wine
56|19|Their heads shall not ache by drinking the same, neither shall their reason be disturbed
56|20|And with fruits of the sorts which they shall choose
56|21|and the flesh of birds of the kind which they shall desire
56|22|And there shall accompany them fair damsels having large black eyes
56|23|resembling pearls hidden in their shells
56|24|As a reward for that which they shall have wrought
56|25|They shall not hear therein any vain discourse, or any charge of sin
56|26|but only the salutation, Peace! Peace
56|27|And the companions of the right hand -- how happy shall the companions of the right hand be
56|28|shall have their abode among lote trees free from thorns
56|29|and trees of mauz loaded regularly with their produce from top to bottom
56|30|under an extended shade
56|31|near a flowing water
56|32|and amidst fruits in abundance
56|33|which shall not fail, nor shall be forbidden to be gathered
56|34|And they shall repose themselves on lofty beds
56|35|Verily We have created the damsels of paradise by a peculiar creation
56|36|And We have made them virgins
56|37|beloved by their husbands, of equal age with them
56|38|for the delight of the companions of the right hand
56|39|There shall be many of the former religions
56|40|and many of the latter
56|41|And the companions of the left hand -- how miserable shall the companions of the left hand be
56|42|Shall dwell amidst burning winds, and scalding water
56|43|under the shade of a black smoke
56|44|neither cool nor agreeable
56|45|For they enjoyed the pleasures of life before this, while on earth
56|46|and obstinately persisted in a heinous wickedness
56|47|And they said, after we shall have died, and become dust and bones, shall we surely be raised to life
56|48|Shall our forefathers also be raised with us
56|49|Say, verily both the first and the last
56|50|shall surely be gathered together to judgment, at the prefixed time of a known day
56|51|Then ye, O men, who have erred, and denied the resurrection as a falsehood
56|52|shall surely eat of the fruit of the tree of al Zakkum
56|53|and shall fill your bellies therewith
56|54|And ye shall drink thereon boiling water
56|55|and ye shall drink as a thirsty camel drinketh
56|56|This shall be their entertainment on the day of judgment
56|57|We have created you: Will ye not therefore believe that We can raise you from the dead
56|58|What think ye? The seed which ye emit
56|59|do ye create the same, or are we the creators thereof
56|60|We have decreed death unto you all: And We shall not be prevented
56|61|We are able to substitute others like unto you in your stead, and to produce you again in the condition or form which ye know not
56|62|Ye know the original production by creation; will ye not therefore consider that We are able to reproduce you by resuscitation
56|63|What think ye? The grain which ye sow
56|64|do ye cause the same to spring forth, or do We cause it to spring forth
56|65|If We pleased, verily We could render the same dry and fruitless, so that ye would not cease to wonder, saying
56|66|verily we have contracted debts for seed and labour
56|67|but we are not permitted to reap the fruit thereof
56|68|What think ye? The water which ye drink
56|69|do ye send down the same from the clouds, or are We the senders thereof
56|70|If We pleased, We could render the same brackish: Will ye not therefore give thanks
56|71|What think ye? The fire which ye strike
56|72|do ye produce the tree whence ye obtain the same, or are We the producers thereof
56|73|We have ordained the same for an admonition, and an advantage unto those who travel through the deserts
56|74|Wherefore praise the name of thy Lord, the great God
56|75|Moreover I swear by the setting of the stars
56|76|and it is surely a great oath, if ye knew it
56|77|that this is the excellent Koran
56|78|the original whereof is written in the preserved book: None shall touch the same
56|79|except those who are clean
56|80|It is a revelation from the Lord of all creatures
56|81|Will ye, therefore, despise this new revelation
56|82|And do ye make this return for your food which ye receive from God, that ye deny yourselves to be obliged to Him for the same
56|83|When the soul of a dying person cometh up to his throat
56|84|and ye at the same time are looking on
56|85|and We are nigher unto him than ye, but ye see not his true condition
56|86|would ye not, if ye are not to be rewarded for your actions hereafter
56|87|cause the same to return into the body, if ye speak truth
56|88|And whether he be of those who shall approach near unto God
56|89|his reward shall be rest, and mercy, and a garden of delights
56|90|Or whether he be of the companions of the right hand
56|91|he shall be saluted with the salutation, Peace be unto thee! By the companions of the right hand, his brethren
56|92|Or whether he be of those who have rejected the true faith, and gone astray
56|93|his entertainment shall consist of boiling water
56|94|and the burning of hell fire
56|95|Verily this is a certain truth
56|96|Wherefore praise the name of thy Lord, the great God
57|1|Whatever is in heaven and earth singeth praise unto God; and He is mighty and wise
57|2|His is the kingdom of heaven and earth; He giveth life, and He putteth to death; and He is almighty
57|3|He is the first, and the last; the manifest, and the hidden: And He knoweth all things
57|4|It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days; and then ascended his throne. He knoweth that which entereth into the earth, and that which issueth out of the same; and that which descendeth from heaven, and that which ascendeth thereto: And He is with you, wheresoever ye be: For God seeth that which ye do
57|5|His is the kindgom of heaven and earth; and unto God shall all things return
57|6|He causeth the night to succeed the day, and He causeth the day to succeed the night; and He knoweth the innermost part of men's breasts
57|7|Believe in God and his apostle, and lay out in alms a part of the wealth whereof God hath made you inheritors: For unto such of you as believe, and bestow alms, shall be given a great reward
57|8|And what aileth you, that ye believe not in God, when the apostle inviteth you to believe in your Lord; and He hath received your covenant concerning this matter, if ye believe any proposition
57|9|It is He who hath sent down unto his servant evident signs, that He may lead you out of darkness into light; for God is compassionate and merciful unto you
57|10|And what aileth you, that ye contribute not of your substance for the defence of God's true religion? Since unto God appertaineth the inheritance of heaven and earth. Those among you who shall have contributed and fought in defence of the faith, before the taking of Mecca, shall not be held equal with those who shall contribute and fight for the same afterwards. These shall be superiour in degree unto those who shall contribute and fight for the propagation of the faith after the abovementioned success: But unto all hath God promised a most excellent reward; and God well knoweth that which ye do
57|11|Who is he that will lend unto God an acceptable loan? For He will double the same unto him, and he shall receive moreover an honourable reward
57|12|On a certain day, thou shalt see the true believers of both sexes: Their light shall run before them, and on their right hands; and it shall be said unto them, good tidings unto you this day: Gardens through which rivers flow; ye shall remain therein for ever. This will be great felicity
57|13|On that day the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women shall say unto those who believe, stay for us, that we may borrow some of your light. It shall be answered, return back into the world, and seek light. And a high wall shall be set betwixt them, wherein shall be a gate, within which shall be mercy; and without it, overagainst the same, the torment of hell
57|14|The hypocrites shall call out unto the true believers, saying, were we not with you? They shall answer, yea; but ye seduced your own souls by your hypocrisy: And ye waited our ruin; and ye doubted concerning the faith; and your wishes deceived you, until the decree of God came, and ye died: And the deceiver deceived you concerning God
57|15|This day, therefore, a ransom shall not be accepted of you, nor of those who have been unbelievers. Your abode shall be hell fire: This is what ye have deserved; and an unhappy journey shall it be thither
57|16|Is not the time yet come unto those who believe, that their hearts should humbly submit to the admonition of God, and to that truth which hath been revealed; and that they be not as those unto whom the scripture was given heretofore, and to whom the time of forbearance was prolonged, but their hearts were hardened, and many of them were wicked doers
57|17|Know that God quickeneth the earth, after it hath been dead. Now have We distinctly declared our signs unto you, that ye may understand
57|18|Verily as to the almsgivers, both men and women, and those who lend unto God an acceptable loan, He will double the same unto them; and they shall moreover receive an honourable reward
57|19|And they who believe in God and his apostles, these are the men of veracity, and the witnesses in the presence of their Lord: They shall have their reward, and their light. But as to those who believe not, and accuse our signs of falsehood, they shall be the companions of hell
57|20|Know that this present life is only a toy and a vain amusement: And worldly pomp, and the affectation of glory among you, and the multiplying of riches and children, are as the plants nourished by the rain, the springing up whereof delighteth the husbandmen; afterwards they wither, so that thou seest the same turned yellow, and at length they become dry stubble. And in the life to come will be a severe punishment for those who covet worldly grandeur; and pardon from God, and favour for those who renounce it: For this present life is no other than a deceitful provision
57|21|Hasten with emulation to obtain pardon from your Lord, and paradise, the extent whereof equalleth the extent of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in God and his apostles. This is the bounty of God: He will give the same unto whom He pleaseth; and God is endued with great bounty
57|22|No accident happeneth in the earth, nor in your persons, but the same was entered in the book of our decrees, before We created it: Verily this is easy with God
57|23|And this is written lest ye immoderately grieve for the good which escapeth you, or rejoice for that which happeneth unto you; for God loveth no proud or vain-glorious person
57|24|or those who are covetous, and command men covetousness. And whoso turneth aside from giving alms; verily God is self-sufficient, worthy to be praised
57|25|We formerly sent our apostles with evident miracles and arguments; and We sent down with them the scriptures, and the balance, that men might observe justice: And We sent them down iron, wherein is mighty strength for war, and various advantages unto mankind: That God may know who assisteth him and his apostles in secret; for God is strong and mighty
57|26|We formerly sent Noah and Abraham, and We established in their posterity the gift of prophecy, and the scripture: And of them some were directed, but many of them were evil doers
57|27|Afterwards We caused our apostles to succeed in their footsteps; and We caused Jesus the son of Mary to succeed them, and We gave him the gospel: And We put in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion and mercy: But as to the monastic state, they instituted the same -- We did not prescribe it to them -- only out of a desire to please God; yet they observed not the same as it ought truly to have been observed. And We gave unto such of them as believed, their reward: But many of them were wicked doers
57|28|O ye who believe in the former prophets, fear God, and believe in his apostle Mohammed: He will give you two portions of his mercy, and He will ordain you a light wherein ye may walk, and He will forgive you; for God is ready to forgive and merciful
57|29|That those who have received the scriptures may know that they have not power over any of the favours of God, and that good is in the hand of God; He bestoweth the same on whom He pleaseth, for God is endued with great beneficence
58|1|Now hath God heard the speech of her who disputed with thee concerning her husband, and made her complaint unto God; and God hath heard your mutual discourse: For God both heareth and seeth
58|2|As to those among you who divorce their wives, by declaring that they will thereafter regard them as their mothers; let them know that they are not their mothers. They only are their mothers who brought them forth; and they certainly utter an unjustifiable saying, and a falsehood: But God is gracious and ready to forgive
58|3|Those who divorce their wives by declaring that they will for the future regard them as their mothers, and afterwards would repair what they have said, shall be obliged to free a captive, before they touch one another. This is what ye are warned to perform: And God is well apprized of that which ye do
58|4|And whoso findeth not a captive to redeem, shall observe a fast of two consecutive months, before they touch one another. And whoso shall not be able to fast that time, shall feed threescore poor men, This is ordained you, that ye may believe in God and his apostle. These are the statutes of God: And for the unbelievers is prepared a grievous torment
58|5|Verily they who oppose God and his apostle, shall be brought low, as the unbelievers who preceded them were brought low. And now have We sent down manifest signs: And an ignominious punishment awaiteth the unbelievers
58|6|On a certain day God shall raise them all to life, and shall declare unto them that which they have wrought. God hath taken an exact account thereof; but they have forgotten the same: And God is witness over all things
58|7|Dost thou not perceive that God knoweth whatever is in heaven and in earth? There is no private discourse among three persons, but He is the fourth of them; nor among five, but He is the sixth of them; neither among a smaller number than this, nor a larger, but He is with them; wheresoever they be: And He will declare unto them that which they have done, on the day of resurrection; for God knoweth all things
58|8|Hast thou not observed those who have been forbidden to use clandestine discourse, but afterwards return to what they have been forbidden, and discourse privily among themselves of wickedness, and enmity, and disobedience towards the apostle? And when they come unto thee, they salute thee with that form of salutation wherewith God doth not salute thee: And they say among themselves, by way of derision, would not God punish us for what we say, if this man were a prophet? Hell shall be their sufficient punishment: They shall go down into the same to be burned; and an unhappy journey shall it be
58|9|O true believers, when ye discourse privily together, discourse not of wickedness, and enmity, and disobedience towards the apostle; but discourse of justice, and piety: And fear God, before whom ye shall be assembled
58|10|Verily the clandestine discourse of the infidels proceedeth from Satan, that he may grieve the true believers: But there shall be none to hurt them in the least, unless by the permission of God; wherefore in God let the faithful trust
58|11|O true believers, when it is said unto you, make room in the assembly; make room: God will grant you ample room in paradise. And when it is said unto you, rise up; rise up: God will raise those of you who believe, and those to whom knowledge is given, to superior degrees of honour: And God is fully apprized of that which ye do
58|12|O true believers, when ye go to speak with the apostle, give alms previously to your discoursing with him: This will be better for you, and more pure. But if ye find not what to give, verily God will be gracious and merciful unto you
58|13|Do ye fear to give alms previously to your discoursing with the prophet, lest ye should impoverish yourselves? Therefore if ye do it not, and God is gracious unto you, by dispensing with the said precept for the future, be constant at prayer, and pay the legal alms; and obey God and his apostle in all other matters: For God well knoweth that which ye do
58|14|Hath thou not observed those who have taken for their friends a people against whom God is incensed? They are neither of you, nor of them: And they swear to a lie knowingly
58|15|God hath prepared for them a grievous punishment; for it is evil which they do
58|16|They have taken their oaths for a cloak, and they have turned men aside from the way of God: Wherefore a shameful punishment awaiteth them
58|17|neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them at all against God. These shall be the inhabitants of hell fire; they shall abide therein for ever
58|18|On a certain day God shall raise them all: Then will they swear unto Him, as they swear now unto you, imagining that it will be of service to them. Are they not liars
58|19|Satan hath prevailed against them, and hath caused them to forget the remembrance of God. These are the party of the devil; and shall not the party of the devil be doomed to perdition
58|20|Verily they who oppose God and his apostle, shall be placed among the most vile
58|21|God hath written; verily I will prevail, and my apostles: For God is strong and mighty
58|22|Thou shalt not find people who believe in God and the last day, to love him who opposeth God and his apostle; although they be their fathers, or their sons, or their brethren, or their nearest relations. In the hearts of these hath God written faith; and He hath strengthened them with his spirit: And He will lead them into gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to remain therein for ever. God is well pleased in them; and they are well pleased in Him. These are the party of God: And shall not the party of God prosper
59|1|Whatever is in heaven and earth celebrateth the praise of God: And He is the mighty, the wise
59|2|It was He who caused those who believed not, of the people who receive the scripture, to depart from their habitations at the first emigration. Ye did not think that they would go forth: And they thought that their fortresses would protect them against God. But the chastisement of God came upon them, from whence they did not expect, and He cast terror into their hearts. They pulled down their houses with their own hands, and the hands of the true believers. Wherefore take example from them, O ye who have eyes
59|3|And if God had not doomed them to banishment, He had surely punished them in this world; and in the world to come they shall suffer the torment of hell fire
59|4|This, because they opposed God and his apostle: And whoso opposeth God, verily God will be severe in punishing him
59|5|What palm-trees ye cut down, or left standing on their roots, were so cut down or left by the will of God; and that He might disgrace the wicked doers
59|6|And as to the spoils of these people which God hath granted wholly to this apostle, ye did not push forward any horses or camels against the same; but God giveth unto his apostles dominion over whom He pleaseth: For God is almighty
59|7|The spoils of the inhabitants of the towns which God hath granted to his apostle, are due unto God and to the apostle, and him who is of kin to the apostle, and the orphans, and the poor, and the traveller; that they may not be for ever divided in a circle among such of you as are rich: What the apostle shall give you, that accept; and what he shall forbid you, that abstain from: And fear God; for God is severe in chastising
59|8|A part also belongeth to the poor Mohajerin, who have been dispossessed of their houses and their substance, seeking favour from God, and his good will, and assisting God and his apostle. These are the men of veracity
59|9|And they who quietly possessed the town of Medina, and professed the faith without molestation, before them, love him who hath fled unto them, and find in their breasts no want of that which is given the Mohajerin, but prefer them before themselves, although there be indigence among them. And whoso is preserved from the covetousness of his own soul, those shall surely prosper
59|10|And they who have come after them say, O Lord, forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in the faith, and put not into our hearts ill-will against those who have believed: O Lord, verily thou art compassionate and merciful
59|11|Hast thou not observed them who play the hypocrites? They say unto their brethren who believe not, of those who have received the scriptures, verily if ye be expelled your habitations, we will surely go forth with you; and we will not pay obedience, in your respect, unto any one for ever: And if ye be attacked, we will certainly assist you. But God is witness that they are liars
59|12|Verily if they be expelled they will not go forth with them; and if they be attacked, they will not assist them; and if they do assist them, they will surely turn their backs: And they shall not be protected
59|13|Verily ye are stronger than they, by reason of the terror cast into their breasts from God. This, because they are not people of prudence
59|14|They will not fight against you in a body, except in fenced towns, or from behind walls. Their strength in war among themselves is great: Thou thinkest them to be united; but their hearts are divided. This, because they are people who do not understand
59|15|Like those who lately preceded them, they have tasted the evil consequence of their deed; and a painful torment is prepared for them hereafter
59|16|Thus have the hypocrites deceived the Jews: Like the devil, when he saith unto a man, be thou an infidel; and when he is become an infidel, he saith, verily I am clear of thee; for I fear God, the Lord of all creatures
59|17|Wherefore the end of them both shall be that they shall dwell in hell fire, abiding therein for ever: And this shall be the recompense of the unjust
59|18|O true believers, fear God; and let a soul look what it sendeth before for the morrow: And fear God, for God is well acquainted with that which ye do
59|19|And be not as those who have forgotten God, and whom He hath caused to forget their own souls: These are the wicked doers
59|20|The inhabitants of hell fire, and the inhabitants of paradise shall not be held equal. The inhabitants of paradise are they who shall enjoy felicity
59|21|If We had sent down this Koran on a mountain, thou wouldest certainly have seen the same humble itself, and cleave in sunder for fear of God. These similitudes do We propose unto men, that they may consider
59|22|He is God, besides whom there is no God; Who knoweth that which is future, and that which is present: He is the most Merciful
59|23|He is God, besides whom there is no God: The King, the Holy, the Giver of peace, the Faithful, the Guardian, the Powerful, the Strong, the most High. Far be God exalted above the idols which they associate with Him
59|24|He is God, the Creator, the Maker, the Former. He hath most excellent names. Whatever is in heaven and earth praiseth Him: And He is the Mighty, the Wise
60|1|O true believers, take not my enemy and your enemy for your friends, shewing kindness toward them; since they believe not in the truth which hath come unto you, having expelled the apostle and yourselves from your native city, because ye believe in God, your Lord. If ye go forth to fight in defence of my religion, and out of a desire to please me, and privately shew friendship unto them; verily I well know that which ye conceal, and that which ye discover: And whoever of you doth this, hath already erred from the strait path
60|2|If they get the better of you, they will be enemies unto you, and they will stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil: And they earnestly desire that ye should become unbelievers
60|3|Neither your kindred nor your children will avail you at all on the day of resurrection, which will separate you from one another: And God seeth that which ye do
60|4|Ye have an excellent pattern in Abraham, and those who were with him, when they said unto their people, verily we are clear of you, and of the idols which ye worship, besides God: We have renounced you; and enmity and hatred is begun between us and you for ever, until ye believe in God alone: Except Abraham's saying unto his father, verily I will beg pardon for thee; but I cannot obtain ought of God in thy behalf. O Lord, in thee do we trust, and unto thee are we turned; and before thee shall we be assembled hereafter
60|5|O Lord, suffer us not to be put to trial by the unbelievers: And forgive us, O Lord; for thou art mighty and wise
60|6|Verily ye have in them an excellent example, unto him who hopeth in God and the last day: And whoso turneth back; verily God is self sufficient, and praise worthy
60|7|Peradventure God will establish friendship between yourselves and such of them as ye now hold for enemies: For God is powerful; and God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
60|8|As to those who have not born arms against you on account of religion, nor turned you out of your dwellings, God forbideth you not to deal kindly with them, and to behave justly towards them; for God loveth those who act justly
60|9|But as to those who have born arms against you on account of religion, and have dispossessed you of your habitations, and have assisted in dispossessing you, God forbideth you to enter into friendship with them: And whosoever of you enters into friendship with them, those are unjust doers
60|10|O true believers, when believing women come unto you as refugees, try them: God well knoweth their faith. And if ye know them to be true believers, send them not back to the infidels: They are not lawful for the unbelievers to have in marriage; neither are the unbelievers lawful for them. But give their unbelieving husbands what they shall have expended for their dowers. Nor shall it be any crime in you if ye marry them, provided ye give them their dowries. And retain not the patronage of the unbelieving women: But demand back that which ye have expended for the dowry of such of your wives as go over to the unbelievers; and let them demand back that which they have expended for the dowry of those who come over to you. This is the judgment of God, which He establisheth among you: And God is knowing and wise
60|11|If any of your wives escape from you to the unbelievers, and ye have your turn by the coming over of any of the unbelievers wives to you; give unto those believers whose wives shall have gone away, out of the dowries of the latter, so much as they shall have expended for the dowers of the former: And fear God, in whom ye believe
60|12|O prophet, when believing women come unto thee, and plight their faith unto thee, that they will not associate any thing with God, nor steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill their children, nor come with a calumny which they have forged between their hands and their feet, nor be disobedient to thee in that which shall be reasonable: Then do thou plight thy faith unto them, and ask pardon for them of God; for God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
60|13|O true believers, enter not into friendship with a people against whom God is incensed: They despair of the life to come, as the infidels despair of the resurrection of those who dwell in the graves
61|1|Whatever is in heaven and in earth celebrateth the praise of God; for He is mighty and wise
61|2|O true believers, why do ye say that which ye do not
61|3|It is most odious in the sight of God, that ye say that which ye do not
61|4|Verily God loveth those who fight for his religion in battle array, as though they were a well compacted building
61|5|Remember when Moses said unto his people, O my people, why do ye injure me; since ye know that I am the apostle of God sent unto you? And when they had deviated from the truth, God made their hearts to deviate from the right way; for God directeth not wicked people
61|6|And when Jesus the Son of Mary said, O children of Israel, verily I am the apostle of God sent unto you, confirming the law which was delivered before me, and bringing good tidings of an apostle who shall come after me, and whose name shall be Ahmed. And when he produced unto them evident miracles, they said, this is manifest sorcery
61|7|But who is more unjust than he who forgeth a lie against God, when he is invited unto Islam? And God directeth not the unjust people
61|8|They seek to extinguish God's light with their mouths: But God will perfect his light, though the infidels be averse thereto
61|9|It is He who hath sent his apostle with the direction, and the religion of truth, that he may exalt the same above every religion, although the idolaters be averse thereto
61|10|O true believers, shall I shew you a merchandize which will deliver you from a painful torment hereafter
61|11|Believe in God and his apostle; and defend God's true religion with your substance, and in your own persons. This will be better for you, if ye knew it
61|12|He will forgive you your sins, and will introduce you into gardens through which rivers flow, and agreeable habitations in gardens of perpetual abode. This will be great felicity
61|13|And ye shall obtain other things which ye desire, namely, assistance from God, and a speedy victory. And do thou bear good tidings to the true believers
61|14|O true believers, be ye the assistants of God; as Jesus the son of Mary said to the apostles, who will be my assistants with respect to God? The apostles answered, we will be the assistants of God. So a part of the children of Israel believed, and a part believed not: But We strengthened those who believed, above their enemy; wherefore they became victorious over them
62|1|Whatever is in heaven and earth praiseth God; the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise
62|2|It is He who hath raised up amidst the illiterate Arabians an apostle from among themselves, to rehearse his signs unto them, and to purify them, and to teach them the scriptures and wisdom; whereas before they were certainly in a manifest error
62|3|And others of them have not yet attained unto them, by embracing the faith; though they also shall be converted in God's good time; for He is mighty and wise
62|4|This is the free grace of God: He bestoweth the same on whom He pleaseth : And God is endued with great beneficence
62|5|The likeness of those who were charged with the observance of the law, and then observed it not, is as the likeness of an ass laden with books: How wretched is the likeness of the people who charge the signs of God with falsehood! And God directeth not the unjust people
62|6|Say, O ye who follow the Jewish religion, if ye say that ye are the friends of God above other men, wish for death, if ye speak truth
62|7|But they will never wish for it, because of that which their hands have sent before them: And God well knoweth the unjust
62|8|Say, verily death, from which ye fly, will surely meet you: Then shall ye be brought before Him who knoweth as well what is concealed as what is discovered; and He will delare unto you that which ye have done
62|9|O true believers, when ye are called to prayer on the day of the assembly, hasten to the commemoration of God, and leave merchandizing. This will be better for you, if ye knew it
62|10|And when prayer is ended, then disperse yourselves through the land as ye list, and seek gain of the liberality of God: And remember God frequently, that ye may prosper
62|11|But when they see any merchandizing, or sport, they flock thereto, and leave thee standing up in thy pulpit. Say, the reward which is with God is better than any sport or merchandize: And God is the best provider
63|1|When the hypocrites come unto thee, they say, we bear witness that thou art indeed the apostle of God. And God knoweth that thou art indeed his apostle: But God beareth witness that the hypocrites are certainly liars
63|2|They have taken their oaths for a protection, and they turn others aside from the way of God: It is surely evil which they do
63|3|This is testified of them, because they believed, and afterwards became unbelievers: Wherefore a seal is set on their hearts, and they shall not understand
63|4|When thou beholdest them, their persons please thee: And if they speak, thou hearest their discourse with delight. They resemble pieces of timber set up against a wall. They imagine every shout to be against them. They are enemies; wherefore beware of them. God curse them: How are they turned aside from the truth
63|5|And when it is said unto them, come, that the apostle of God may ask pardon for you; they turn away their heads, and thou seest them retire big with disdain
63|6|It shall be equal unto them, whether thou ask pardon for them, or do not ask pardon for them; God will by no means forgive them: For God directeth not the prevaricating people
63|7|These are the men who say to the inhabitants of Medina, do not bestow any thing on the refugees who are with the apostle of God, that they may be obliged to separate from him. Whereas unto God belong the stores of heaven and earth: But the hypocrites do not understand
63|8|They say, verily, if we return to Medina, the worthier shall expel thence the meaner. Whereas superior worth belongeth unto God, and his apostle, and the true believers: But the hypocrites know it not
63|9|O true believers, let not your riches or your children divert you from the remembrance of God: For whosoever doth this, they will surely be losers
63|10|And give alms out of that which We have bestowed on you; before death come unto one of you, and he say, O Lord, wilt thou not grant me respite for a short term; that I may give alms, and become one of the righteous
63|11|For God will by no means grant further respite to a soul, when its determined time is come: And God is fully apprized of that which ye do
64|1|Whatever is in heaven and earth celebrateth the praises of God: His is the kingdom, and unto Him is the praise due; for He is almighty
64|2|It is He who hath created you; and one of you is predestined to be an unbeliever, and another of you is predestined to be a believer: And God beholdeth that which ye do
64|3|He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth; and He hath fashioned you, and given you beautiful forms: And unto Him must ye all go
64|4|He knoweth whatever is in heaven and earth: And He knoweth that which ye conceal, and that which ye discover; for God knoweth the innermost part of mens breasts
64|5|Have ye not been acquainted with the story of those who disbelieved heretofore, and tasted the evil consequence of their behaviour? And for them is prepared, in the life to come, a tormenting punishment
64|6|This shall they suffer, because their apostles came unto them with evident proofs of their mission, and they said, shall men direct us? Wherefore they believed not, and turned their backs. But God standeth in need of no person: For God is self-sufficient, and worthy to be praised
64|7|The unbelievers imagine that they shall not be raised again. Say, yea, by my Lord, ye shall surely be raised again: Then shall ye be told that which ye have wrought; and this is easy with God
64|8|Wherefore believe in God and his apostle, and the light which We have sent down: For God is well acquainted with that which ye do
64|9|On a certain day He shall assemble you, at the day of the general assembly: That will be the day of mutual deceit: And whoso shall believe in God, and shall do that which is right, from him will He expiate his evil deeds, and He will lead him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to remain therein for ever. This will be great felicity
64|10|But they who shall not believe, and shall accuse our signs of falsehood, those shall be the inhabitants of hell fire, wherein they shall remain for ever; and a wretched journey shall it be thither
64|11|No misfortune happeneth but by the permission of God; and whoso believeth in God, he will direct his heart: And God knoweth all things
64|12|Wherefore obey God, and obey the apostle; But if ye turn back, verily the duty incumbent on our apostle is only public preaching
64|13|God! There in no God but He: Wherefore in God let the faithful put their trust
64|14|O true believers, verily of your wives and your children ye have an enemy: Wherefore beware of them. But if ye pass over their offences, and pardon, and forgive them; God is likewise inclined to forgive, and merciful
64|15|Your wealth and your children are only a temptation: But with God is a great reward
64|16|Wherefore fear God, as much as ye are able; and hear, and obey: And give alms, for the good of your souls; for whoso is preserved from the covetousness of his own soul, they shall prosper
64|17|If ye lend unto God an acceptable loan, He will double the same unto you, and will forgive you: For God is grateful and long-suffering
64|18|knowing both what is hidden, and what is divulged; the mighty, the wise
65|1|O prophet, when ye divorce women, put them away at their appointed term; and compute the term exactly: And fear God, your Lord. Oblige them not to go out of their apartments, neither let them go out, until the term be expired, unless they be guilty of manifest uncleanness. These are the statutes of God: And whoever transgresseth the statutes of God, assuredly injureth his own soul: Thou knowest not whether God will bring something new to pass, which may reconcile them, after this
65|2|And when they shall have fulfilled their term, either retain them with kindness, or part from them honourably: And take witnesses from among you, men of integrity; and give your testimony as in the presence of God: This admonition is given unto him who believeth in God and the last day: And whoso feareth God, unto him will He grant a happy issue out of all his afflictions
65|3|and He will bestow on him an ample provision from whence he expecteth it not: And whoso trusteth in God, He will be his sufficient support; for God will surely attain his purpose. Now hath God appointed unto every thing a determined period
65|4|As to such of your wives as shall despair having their courses, by reason of their age; if ye be in doubt thereof, let their term be three months: And let the same be the term of those who have not yet had their courses. But as to those who are pregnant, their term shall be, until they be delivered of their burden. And whoso feareth God, unto him will He make his command easy
65|5|This is the command of God, which He hath sent down unto you. And whoso feareth God, He will expiate his evil deeds from him, and will increase his reward
65|6|Suffer the women whom ye divorce to dwell in some part of the houses wherein ye dwell; according to the room and conveniences of the habitations which ye possess: And make them not uneasy, that ye may reduce them to straits. And if they be with child, expend on them what shall be needful, until they be delivered of their burden. And if they suckle their children for you, give them their hire; and consult among yourselves, according to what shall be just and reasonable. And if ye be put to a difficulty herein, and another woman shall suckle the child for him
65|7|let him who hath plenty expend proportionably, in the maintenance of the mother and the nurse, out of his plenty: And let him whose income is scanty, expend in proportion out of that which God hath given him. God obligeth no man to more than He hath given him ability to perform: God will cause ease to succeed hardship
65|8|How many cities have turned aside from the command of their Lord and his apostles? Wherefore We brought them to a severe account; and We chastised them with a grievous chastisement
65|9|And they tasted the evil consequence of their business; and the end of their business was perdition
65|10|God hath prepared for them a severe punishment: Wherefore fear God, O ye who are indued with understanding. True believers, now hath God sent down unto you an admonition
65|11|an apostle who may rehearse unto you the perspicuous signs of God; that he may bring forth those who believe and do good works, from darkness into light. And whoso believeth in God, and doth that which is right, him will He lead into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to remain therein for ever: Now hath God made an excellent provision for him
65|12|It is God who hath created seven heavens, and as many different stories of the earth: The divine command descendeth between them; that ye may know that God is omnipotent, and that God comprehendeth all things by his knowledge
66|1|O prophet, why holdest thou that to be prohibited which God hath allowed thee, seeking to please thy wives; since God is inclined to forgive and merciful
66|2|God hath allowed you the dissolution of your oaths: And God is your master; and He is knowing and wise
66|3|When the prophet intrusted as a secret unto one of his wives a certain accident; and when she disclosed the same, and God made it known unto him; he acquainted her with part of what she had done, and forbore to upbraid her with the other part thereof. And when he had acquainted her therewith, she said, who hath discovered this unto thee? He answered, the knowing, the sagacious God hath discovered it unto me
66|4|If ye both be turned unto God -- for your hearts have swerved -- it is well: But if ye join against him, verily God is his patron; and Gabriel, and the good man among the faithful, and the angels also are his assistants
66|5|If he divorce you, his Lord can easily give him in exchange other wives better than you, women resigned unto God, true believers, devout, penitent, obedient, given to fasting, both such as have been known by other men, and virgins
66|6|O true believers, save your souls, and those of your families, from the fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are set angels fierce and terrible; who disobey not God in what He hath commanded them, but perform what they are commanded
66|7|O unbelievers, excuse not yourselves this day; ye shall surely be rewarded for what ye have done
66|8|O true believers, turn unto God with a sincere repentance: Peradventure your Lord will do away from you your evil deeds, and will admit you into gardens, through which rivers flow; on the day whereon God will not put to shame the prophet, or those who believe with him: Their light shall run before them, and on their right hands, and they shall say, Lord, make our light perfect, and forgive us; for thou art almighty
66|9|O prophet, attack the infidels with arms, and the hypocrites with arguments; and treat them with severity: Their abode shall be hell, and an ill journey shall it be thither
66|10|God propoundeth as a similitude unto the unbelievers, the wife of Noah, and the wife of Lot: They were under two of our righteous servants, and they deceived them both; wherefore their husbands were of no advantage unto them at all, in the sight of God: And it shall be said unto them, at the last day, enter ye into hell fire, with those who enter therein
66|11|God also propoundeth as a similitude unto those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh; when she said, Lord, build me an house with thee in paradise; and deliver me from Pharaoh and his doings, and deliver me from the unjust people
66|12|And Mary the daughter of Imran; who preserved her chastity, and into whose womb we breathed of our spirit, and who believed in the words of her Lord and his scriptures, and was a devout and obedient person
67|1|Blessed be He in whose hand is the kingdom; for He is almighty
67|2|Who hath created death and life, that He might prove you, which of you is most righteous in his actions: And He is mighty, and ready to forgive
67|3|Who hath created seven heavens, one above another: Thou canst not see in a creature of the most Merciful any unfitness or disproportion. Lift up thine eyes again to heaven, and look whether thou seest any flaw
67|4|Then take two other views; and thy sight shall return unto thee dull and fatigued
67|5|Moreover We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and have appointed them to be darted at the devils, for whom We have prepared the torment of burning fire
67|6|And for those who believe not in their Lord, is also prepared the torment of hell; an ill journey shall it be thither
67|7|When they shall be thrown thereinto, they shall hear it bray like an ass; and it shall boil
67|8|and almost burst for fury. So often as a company of them shall be thrown therein, the keepers thereof shall ask them, saying, did not a warner come unto you
67|9|They shall answer, yea, a warner came unto us: But we accused him of imposture, and said, God hath not revealed any thing; ye are in no other than a great error
67|10|And they shall say, if we had hearkened, or had rightly considered, we should not have been among the inhabitants of burning fire
67|11|And they shall confess their sins; but far be the inhabitants of burning fire from obtaining mercy
67|12|Verily they who fear their Lord in secret, shall receive pardon and a great reward
67|13|Either conceal your discourse, or make it public; He knoweth the innermost parts of your breasts
67|14|Shall not He know all things who hath created them; since He is the sagacious, the knowing
67|15|It is He who hath levelled the earth for you: Therefore walk through the regions thereof, and eat of his provision; unto Him shall be the resurrection
67|16|Are ye secure that He who dwelleth in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up? And behold, it shall shake
67|17|Or are ye secure that He who dwelleth in heaven will not send against you an impetuous whirlwind, driving the sands to overwhelm you? Then shall ye know how important my warning was
67|18|Those also who were before you disbelieved; and how grievous was my displeasure
67|19|Do they not behold the birds above them, extending and drawing back their wings? None sustaineth them, except the Merciful; for He regardeth all things
67|20|Or who is he that will be as an army unto you, to defend you against the Merciful? Verily the unbelievers are in no other than a mistake
67|21|Or who is he that will give you food, if He withholdeth his provision? Yet they persist in perverseness, and flying from the truth
67|22|Is he, therefore, who goeth grovelling upon his face, better directed than he who walketh upright in a strait way
67|23|Say, it is He who hath given you being, and endued you with hearing, and sight, and understanding; yet how little gratitude have ye
67|24|Say, it is He who hath sown you in the earth, and unto Him shall ye be gathered together
67|25|They say, when shall this menace be put in execution if ye speak truth
67|26|Answer, the knowledge of this matter is with God alone: For I am only a public warner
67|27|But when they shall see the same nigh at hand, the countenance of the infidels shall grow sad: And it shall be said unto them, this is what ye have been demanding
67|28|Say, what think ye? Whether God destroy me and those who are with me, or have mercy on us; who will protect the unbelievers from a painful punishment
67|29|Say, He is the Merciful; in Him do we believe, and in Him do we put our trust. Ye shall hereafter know who is in a manifest error
67|30|Say, what think ye? If your water be in the morning swallowed up by the earth, who will give you clear and running water
68|1|By the pen, and what they write
68|2|thou, O Mohammed, through the grace of thy Lord, art not distracted
68|3|Verily there is prepared for thee an everlasting reward
68|4|For thou art of a noble disposition
68|5|Thou shalt see, and the infidels shall see
68|6|which of you are bereaved of your senses
68|7|Verily thy Lord well knoweth him who wandereth from his path; and He well knoweth those who are rightly directed
68|8|Wherefore obey not those who charge thee with imposture
68|9|They desire that thou shouldest be easy with them, and they will be easy with thee
68|10|But obey not any who is a common swearer, a despicable fellow
68|11|a defamer, going about with slander
68|12|who forbiddeth that which is good, who is also a transgressor, a wicked person
68|13|cruel, and besides this, of spurious birth
68|14|Although he be possessed of wealth and many children
68|15|When our signs are rehearsed unto him, he saith, they are fables of the ancients
68|16|We will stigmatize him on the nose
68|17|Verily We have tried the Meccans, as We formerly tried the owners of the garden; when they swore that they would gather the fruit thereof in the morning
68|18|and added not the exception, if it please God
68|19|Wherefore a surrounding destruction from thy Lord encompassed it, while they slept
68|20|and in the morning it became like a garden whose fruits had been gathered
68|21|And they called the one to the other as they rose in the morning, saying
68|22|Go out early to your plantation, if ye intend to gather the fruit thereof
68|23|So they went on, whispering to one another
68|24|no poor man shall enter the garden upon you, this day
68|25|And they went forth early, with a determined purpose
68|26|And when they saw the garden blasted and destroyed, they said, we have certainly mistaken our way
68|27|But when they found it to be their own garden, they cried, verily we are not permitted to reap the fruit thereof
68|28|The worthier of them said, did I not say unto you, will ye not give praise unto God
68|29|They answered, praise be unto our Lord! Verily we have been unjust doers
68|30|And they began to blame one another
68|31|and they said, woe be unto us! Verily we have been transgressors
68|32|Peradventure our Lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this: And we earnestly beseech our Lord to pardon us
68|33|Thus is the chastisement of this life: But the chastisement of the next shall be more grievous; if they had known it, they would have taken heed
68|34|Verily for the pious are prepared, with their Lord, gardens of delight
68|35|Shall we deal with the Moslems, as with the wicked
68|36|What aileth you that ye judge thus
68|37|Have ye a book from heaven, wherein ye read
68|38|that ye are therein promised that which ye shall choose
68|39|Or have ye received oaths which shall be binding upon us to the day of resurrection, that ye shall enjoy what ye imagine
68|40|Ask them, which of them will be the voucher of this
68|41|Or have they companions who will vouch for them? Let them produce their companions, therefore, if they speak truth
68|42|On a certain day the leg shall be made bare; and they shall be called upon to worship, but they shall not be able
68|43|Their looks shall be cast down: Ignominy shall attend them: For that they were invited to the worship of God, while they were in safety, but would not hear
68|44|Let Me alone, therefore, with him who accuseth this new revelation of imposture. We will lead them gradually to destruction, by ways which they know not
68|45|And I will bear with them for a long time; for my stratagem is effectual
68|46|Dost thou ask them any reward for thy preaching? But they are laden with debts
68|47|Are the secrets of futurity with them; and do they transcribe the same from the table of God's decrees
68|48|Wherefore patiently wait the judgment of thy Lord: And be not like him who was swallowed by the fish; when he cried unto God, being inwardly vexed
68|49|Had not grace from his Lord reached him, he had surely been cast forth on the naked shore, covered with shame
68|50|But his Lord chose him, and made him one of the righteous
68|51|It wanteth little but that the unbelievers strike thee down with their malicious looks, when they hear the admonition of the Koran; and they say, he is certainly distracted
68|52|But it is no other than an admonition unto all creatures
69|1|The infallible
69|2|What is the infallible
69|3|And what shall cause thee to understand what the infallible is
69|4|The tribes of Thamud and Ad denied as a falsehood the day which shall strike men's hearts with terror
69|5|But Thamud were destroyed by a terrible noise
69|6|And Ad were destroyed by a roaring and furious wind
69|7|which God caused to assail them for seven nights and eight days successively: Thou mightest have seen people, during the same, lying prostrate, as though they had been the roots of hollow palm-trees
69|8|and couldest thou have seen any of them remaining
69|9|Pharaoh also, and those who were before him, and the cities which were overthrown, were guilty of sin
69|10|and they severally were disobedient to the apostle of their Lord; wherefore He chastised them with an abundant chastisement
69|11|When the water of the deluge arose, We carried you in the ark which swam thereon
69|12|that We might make the same a memorial unto you, and the retaining ear might retain it
69|13|And when one blast shall sound the trumpet
69|14|and the earth shall be moved from its place, and the mountains also, and shall be dashed in pieces at one stroke
69|15|On that day the inevitable hour of judgment shall suddenly come
69|16|and the heavens shall cleave in sunder, and shall fall in pieces, on that day
69|17|And the angels shall be on the sides thereof; and eight shall bear the throne of thy Lord above them, on that day
69|18|On that day ye shall be presented before the judgment seat of God; and none of your secret actions shall be hidden
69|19|And he who shall have his book delivered into his right hand, shall say, take ye, read this my book
69|20|verily I thought that I should be brought to this my account
69|21|He shall lead a pleasing life
69|22|in a lofty garden
69|23|the fruits whereof shall be near to gather
69|24|Eat and drink with easy digestion; because of the good works which ye sent before you, in the days which are past
69|25|But he who shall have his book delivered into his left hand, shall say, O that I had not received this my book
69|26|and that I had not known what this my account was
69|27|O that death had made an end of me
69|28|My riches have not profited me
69|29|and my power is passed from me
69|30|And God shall say to the keepers of hell, take him, and bind him
69|31|and cast him into hell to be burned
69|32|then put him into a chain of the length of seventy cubits
69|33|Because he believed not in the great God
69|34|and was not solicitous to feed the poor
69|35|Wherefore this day he shall have no friend here
69|36|nor any food, but the filthy corruption flowing from the bodies of the damned
69|37|which none shall eat but the sinners
69|38|I swear by that which ye see
69|39|and that which ye see not
69|40|that this is the discourse of an honourable apostle
69|41|and not the discourse of a poet: How little do ye believe
69|42|Neither is it the discourse of a soothsayer: How little are ye admonished
69|43|It is a revelation from the Lord of all creatures
69|44|If Mohammed had forged any part of these discourses concerning Us
69|45|verily We had taken him by the right hand
69|46|and had cut in sunder the vein of his heart
69|47|neither would We have withheld any of you from chastising him
69|48|And verily this book is an admonition unto the pious
69|49|and We well know that there are some of you who charge the same with imposture
69|50|But it shall surely be an occasion of grievous sighing unto the infidels
69|51|for it is the truth of a certainty
69|52|Wherefore praise the name of thy Lord, the great God
70|1|One demanded and called for vengeance to fall on the unbelievers
70|2|There shall be none to avert the same
70|3|from being inflicted by God, the possessor of the steps
70|4|by which the angels ascend unto Him, and the spirit Gabriel also, in a day whose space is fifty thousand years
70|5|Wherefore bear the insults of the Meccans with becoming patience
70|6|for they see their punishment afar off
70|7|but We see it nigh at hand
70|8|On a certain day the heaven shall become like molten brass
70|9|and the mountains like wool of various colours, scattered abroad by the wind
70|10|And a friend shall not ask a friend concerning his condition, although
70|11|they see one another. The wicked shall wish to redeem himself from the punishment of that day, by giving up his children
70|12|and his wife, and his brother
70|13|and his kindred who shewed kindness unto him
70|14|and all who are in the earth; and that this might deliver him
70|15|By no means: For hell fire
70|16|dragging them by their scalps
70|17|shall call him who shall have turned his back, and fled from the faith
70|18|and shall have amassed riches, and covetously hoarded them
70|19|Verily man is created extremely impatient
70|20|When evil toucheth him, he is full of complaint
70|21|but when good befalleth him, he becometh niggardly
70|22|Except those who are devoutly given
70|23|and who persevere in their prayers
70|24|and those of whose substance a due and certain portion is ready to be given
70|25|unto him who asketh, and him who is forbidden by shame to ask
70|26|And those who sincerely believe the day of judgment
70|27|and who dread the punishment of their Lord
70|28|For there is none secure from the punishment of their Lord
70|29|And who abstain from the carnal knowledge
70|30|of women other than their wives, or the slaves which their right hands possess; -- for as to them they shall be blameless
70|31|but whoever coveteth any woman besides these, they are transgressors
70|32|And those who faithfully keep what they are intrusted with, and their covenant
70|33|and who are upright in their testimonies
70|34|and who carefully observe the requisite rites in their prayers
70|35|These shall dwell amidst gardens, highly honoured
70|36|What aileth the unbelievers, that they run before thee
70|37|in companies, on the right hand and on the left
70|38|Doth every man of them wish to enter into a garden of delight
70|39|By no means: Verily We have created them of that which they know
70|40|I swear by the Lord of the east and of the west, that We are able to destroy them
70|41|and to substitute better than them in their room; neither are We to be prevented, if We shall please so to do
70|42|Wherefore suffer them to wade in vain disputes, and to amuse themselves with sport: Until they meet their day with which they have been threatened
70|43|the day whereon they shall come forth hastily from their graves, as though they were troops hastening to their standard
70|44|Their looks shall be downcast; ignominy shall attend them. This is the day with which they have been threatened
71|1|Verily We sent Noah unto his people, saying, warn thy people, before a grievous punishment overtake them
71|2|Noah said, O my people, verily I am a public warner unto you
71|3|Wherefore serve God, and fear Him, and obey me
71|4|He will forgive you part of your sins, and will grant you respite until a determined time: For God's determined time, when it cometh, shall not be deferred; if ye were men of understanding, ye would know this
71|5|He said, Lord, verily I have called my people night and day
71|6|but my calling only increaseth their aversion
71|7|And whensoever I call them to the true faith, that Thou mayest forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, and cover themselves with their garments, and persist in their infidelity, and proudly disdain my counsel
71|8|Moreover I invited them openly
71|9|and I spake to them again in public; and I also secretly admonished them in private
71|10|And I said, beg pardon of your Lord; for He is inclined to forgive
71|11|And He will cause the heaven to pour down rain plentifully upon you
71|12|and will give you increase of wealth and of children; and He will provide you gardens, and furnish you with rivers
71|13|What aileth you, that ye hope not for benevolence in God
71|14|since He hath created you variously
71|15|Do ye not see how God hath created the seven heavens, one above another
71|16|and hath placed the moon therein for a light, and hath appointed the sun for a taper
71|17|God hath also produced and caused you to spring forth from the earth
71|18|Hereafter He will cause you to return into the same; and He will again take you thence, by bringing you forth from your graves
71|19|And God hath spread the earth as a carpet for you
71|20|that ye may walk therein through spacious paths
71|21|Noah said, Lord, verily they are disobedient unto me; and they follow him whose riches and children do no other than increase his perdition
71|22|And they devised a dangerous plot against Noah
71|23|And the chief men said to the others, ye shall by no means leave your gods; neither shall ye forsake Wadd, nor Sowa, nor Yaghuth, and Yauk, and Nesr
71|24|And they seduced many; -- for thou shalt only increase error in the wicked
71|25|Because of their sins they were drowned, and cast into the fire of hell; and they found none to protect them against God
71|26|And Noah said, Lord, leave not any families of the unbelievers on the earth
71|27|For if thou leave them, they will seduce thy servants, and will beget none but a wicked and unbelieving offspring
71|28|Lord, forgive me and my parents, and every one who shall enter my house, being a true believer, and the true believers of both sexes; and add unto the unjust doers nothing but destruction
72|1|Say, it hath been revealed unto me that a company of genii attentively heard me reading the Koran, and said, verily we have heard an admirable discourse
72|2|which directeth unto the right institution: Wherefore we believe therein, and we will by no means associate any other with our Lord
72|3|He -- may the majesty of our Lord be exalted! -- hath taken no wife, nor hath He begotten any issue
72|4|Yet the foolish among us hath spoken that which is extremely false of God
72|5|But we verily thought that neither man nor genius would by any means have uttered a lie concerning God
72|6|And there are certain men who fly for refuge unto certain of the genii; but they increase their folly and transgression
72|7|And they also thought, as ye thought, that God would not raise any one to life
72|8|And we formerly attempted to pry into what was transacting in heaven; but we found the same filled with a strong guard of angels, and with flaming darts
72|9|And we sat on some of the seats thereof to hear the discourse of its inhabitants; but whoever listeneth now, findeth a flame laid in ambush for him, to guard the celestial confines
72|10|And we know not whether evil be hereby intended against those who are in the earth, or whether their Lord intendeth to direct them aright
72|11|There are some among us who are upright; and there are some among us who are otherwise: We are of different ways
72|12|And we verily thought that we could by no means frustrate God in the earth, neither could we escape Him by flight
72|13|Wherefore, when we had heard the direction contained in the Koran, we believed therein. And whoever believeth in his Lord, need not fear any diminution of his reward, nor any injustice
72|14|There are some Moslems among us; and there are others of us who swerve from righteousness. And whoso embraceth Islam, they earnestly seek true direction
72|15|But those who swerve from righteousness, shall be fuel for hell
72|16|If they tread in the way of truth, We will surely water them with abundant rain
72|17|that We may prove them thereby: But whoso turneth aside from the admonition of his Lord, him will he send into a severe torment
72|18|Verily the places of worship are set apart unto God: Wherefore invoke not any other therein together with God
72|19|When the servant of God stood up to invoke Him, it wanted little but that the genii had pressed on him in crouds, to hear him rehearse the Koran
72|20|Say, verily I call upon my Lord only, and I associate no other god with Him
72|21|Say, verily I am not able, of myself, to procure you either hurt, or a right institution
72|22|Say, verily none can protect me against God; neither shall I find any refuge besides Him
72|23|I can do no more than publish what hath been revealed unto me from God, and his messages. And whosoever shall be disobedient unto God and his apostle, for him is the fire of hell prepared; they shall remain therein for ever
72|24|Until they see the vengeance with which they are threatened, they will not cease their opposition: But then shall they know who were the weaker in a protector, and the fewer in number
72|25|Say, I know not whether the punishment with which ye are threatened be nigh, or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term
72|26|He knoweth the secrets of futurity; and He doth not communicate his secrets unto any
72|27|except an apostle in whom He is well pleased: And He causeth a guard of angels to march before Him, and behind Him
72|28|that He may know that they have executed the commissions of their Lord: He comprehendeth whatever is with them; and counteth all things by number
73|1|O thou wrapped up
73|2|arise to prayer, and continue therein during the night
73|3|except a small part; that is to say, during one half thereof: Or do thou lessen the same a little
73|4|or add thereto. And repeat the Koran with a distinct and sonorous voice
73|5|For We will lay on thee a weighty word
73|6|Verily the rising by night is more efficacious for stedfast continuance in devotion, and more conducive to decent pronunciation
73|7|For in the day-time thou hast long employment
73|8|And commemorate the name of thy Lord: And separate thy self unto Him, renouncing worldly vanities
73|9|He is the Lord of the east, and of the west; there is no God but He. Wherefore take Him for thy patron
73|10|And patiently suffer the contumelies which the infidels utter against thee; and depart from them with a decent departure
73|11|And let Me alone with those who charge the Koran with falsehood, who enjoy the blessings of this life; and bear with them for a while
73|12|Verily with Us are heavy fetters, and a burning fire
73|13|and food ready to choke him who swalloweth it, and painful torment
73|14|On a certain day the earth shall be shaken, and the mountains also, and the mountains shall become a heap of sand poured forth
73|15|Verily We have sent unto you an apostle, to bear witness against you; as We sent an apostle unto Pharaoh
73|16|But Pharaoh was disobedient unto the apostle; wherefore We chastised him with a heavy chastisement
73|17|How, therefore, will ye escape, if ye believe not, the day which shall make children become greyheaded through terror
73|18|The heaven shall be rent in sunder thereby: The promise thereof shall surely be performed
73|19|Verily this is an admonition; and whoever is willing to be admonished, will take the way unto his Lord
73|20|Thy Lord knoweth that thou continuest in prayer and meditation sometimes near two third parts of the night, and sometimes one half thereof, and at other times one third part thereof: And a part of thy companions, who are with thee, do the same. But God measureth the night and the day; he knoweth that ye cannot exactly compute the same: Wherefore He turneth favourably unto you. Read, therefore, so much of the Koran as may be easy unto you. He knoweth that there will be some infirm among you; and others travel through the earth, that they may obtain a competency of the bounty of God; and others fight in the defence of God's faith. Read, therefore, so much of the same as may be easy. And observe the stated times of prayer, and pay the legal alms; and lend unto God an acceptable loan; for whatever good ye send before for your souls, ye shall find the same with God. This will be better, and will merit a greater reward. And ask God forgiveness; for God is ready to forgive, and merciful
74|1|O thou covered
74|2|arise and preach
74|3|and magnify thy Lord
74|4|And cleanse thy garments
74|5|And fly every abomination
74|6|And be not liberal, in hopes to receive more in return
74|7|And patiently wait for thy Lord
74|8|When the trumpet shall sound
74|9|verily that day shall be a day of distress
74|10|and uneasiness unto the unbelievers
74|11|Let me alone with him whom I have created
74|12|on whom I have bestowed abundant riches
74|13|and children dwelling in his presence
74|14|and for whom I have disposed affairs in a smooth and easy manner
74|15|and who desireth that I will yet add other blessings unto him
74|16|By no means: Because he is an adversary to our signs
74|17|I will afflict him with grievous calamities
74|18|For he hath devised and prepared contumelious expressions to ridicule the Koran
74|19|May he be cursed: How maliciously hath he prepared the same
74|20|And again, may he be cursed: How maliciously hath he prepared the same
74|21|Then he looked
74|22|and frowned, and put on an austere countenance
74|23|Then he turned back, and was elated with pride
74|24|and he said, this is no other than a piece of magic, borrowed from others
74|25|These are only the words of a man
74|26|I will cast him to be burned in hell
74|27|And what shall make thee to understand what hell is
74|28|It leaveth not any thing unconsumed, neither doth it suffer any thing to escape
74|29|It scorcheth mens flesh
74|30|Over the same are nineteen angels appointed
74|31|We have appointed none but angels to preside over hell fire: And we have expressed the number of them only for an occasion of discord to the unbelievers; that they to whom the scriptures have been given, may be certain of the veracity of this book, and the true believers may increase in faith; and that those to whom the scriptures have been given, and the true believers may not doubt hereafter; and that those in whose hearts there is an infirmity, and the unbelievers may say, what mystery doth God intend by this number? Thus doth God cause to err whom He pleaseth; and He directeth whom He pleaseth. None knoweth the armies of thy Lord, besides Him: And this is no other than a memento unto mankind. Assuredly
74|32|By the moon
74|33|and the night when it retreateth
74|34|and the morning when it reddeneth
74|35|I swear that this is one of the most terrible calamities
74|36|giving warning unto men
74|37|as well unto him among you who desireth to go forward, as unto him who chooseth to remain behind
74|38|Every soul is given in pledge for that which it shall have wrought
74|39|Except the companions of the right hand
74|40|who shall dwell in gardens, and shall ask one another questions
74|41|concerning the wicked
74|42|and shall also ask the wicked themselves, saying, what hath brought you into hell
74|43|They shall answer, we were not of those who were constant at prayer
74|44|neither did we feed the poor
74|45|and we waded in vain disputes, with the fallacious reasoners
74|46|and we denied the day of judgment
74|47|until death overtook us
74|48|And the intercession of the interceders shall not avail them
74|49|What aileth them, therefore, that they turn aside from the admonition of the Koran
74|50|as though they were timorous asses
74|51|flying from a lion
74|52|But every man among them desireth that he may have expanded scrolls delivered to him from God
74|53|By no means. They fear not the life to come
74|54|By no means: Verily this is a sufficient warning
74|55|Whoso is willing to be warned, him shall it warn
74|56|But they shall not be warned, unless God shall please. He is worthy to be feared; and he is inclined to forgiveness
75|1|Verily I swear by the day of resurrection
75|2|and I swear by the soul which accuseth itself
75|3|Doth man think that We will not gather his bones together
75|4|Yea: We are able to put together the smallest bones of his fingers
75|5|But man chooseth to be wicked, for the time which is before him
75|6|He asketh, when will the day of resurrection be
75|7|But when the sight shall be dazzled
75|8|and the moon shall be eclipsed
75|9|and the sun and the moon shall be in conjunction
75|10|on that day man shall say, where is a place of refuge
75|11|By no means: There shall be no place to fly unto
75|12|With thy Lord shall be the sure mansion of rest on that day
75|13|On that day shall a man be told that which he hath done first and last
75|14|Yea; a man shall be an evidence against himself
75|15|And though he offer his excuses, they shall not be received
75|16|Move not thy tongue, O Mohammed, in repeating the revelations brought thee by Gabriel, before he shall have finished the same, that thou mayest quickly commit them to memory
75|17|For the collecting the Koran in thy mind, and the teaching thee the true reading thereof are incumbent on Us
75|18|But when We shall have read the same unto thee by the tongue of the angel, do thou follow the reading thereof
75|19|And afterwards it shall be our part to explain it unto thee
75|20|By no means shalt thou be thus hasty for the future. But ye love that which hasteneth away
75|21|and neglect the life to come
75|22|Some countenances, on that day, shall be bright
75|23|looking towards their Lord
75|24|and some countenances, on that day, shall be dismal
75|25|They shall think that a crushing calamity shall be brought upon them
75|26|Assuredly. When a man's soul shall come up to his throat, in his last agony
75|27|and the standers-by shall say, who bringeth a charm to recover him
75|28|And shall think it to be his departure out of this world
75|29|and one leg shall be joined with the other leg
75|30|On that day unto thy Lord shall he be driven
75|31|For he believed not, neither did he pray
75|32|but he accused God's apostle of imposture, and turned back from obeying him
75|33|Then he departed unto his family, walking with a haughty mien
75|34|Wherefore, woe be unto thee; woe
75|35|And again, woe be unto thee; woe
75|36|Doth man think that he shall be left at full liberty, without control
75|37|Was he not a drop of seed, which was emitted
75|38|Afterwards he became a little coagulated blood; and God formed him, and fashioned him with just proportion
75|39|And made of him two sexes, the male and the female
75|40|Is not he who hath done this able to quicken the dead
76|1|Did there not pass over man a long space of time; during which he was a thing not worthy of remembrance
76|2|Verily we have created man of the mingled seed of both sexes, that We might prove him: And We have made him to hear and to see
76|3|We have surely directed him in the way; whether he be grateful, or ungrateful
76|4|Verily we have prepared for the unbelievers chains, and collars, and burning fire
76|5|But the just shall drink of a cup of wine, mixed with the water of Cafur
76|6|a fountain whereof the servants of God shall drink; they shall convey the same by channels whithersoever they please
76|7|These fulfil their vow, and dread the day, the evil whereof will disperse itself far abroad
76|8|and give food unto the poor, and the orphan, and the bondman, for his sake
76|9|saying, we feed you for God's sake only: We desire no recompense from you, nor any thanks
76|10|Verily we dread, from our Lord, a dismal and calamitous day
76|11|Wherefore God shall deliver them from the evil of that day, and shall cast on them brightness of countenance, and joy
76|12|and shall reward them, for their patient persevering, with a garden, and silk garments
76|13|Therein shall they repose themselves on couches; they shall see therein neither sun nor moon
76|14|and the shades thereof shall be near spreading above them, and the fruits thereof shall hang low, so as to be easily gathered
76|15|And their attendants shall go round about unto them, with vessels of silver, and goblets
76|16|The bottles shall be bottles of silver shining like glass; they shall determine the measure thereof by their wish
76|17|And therein shall they be given to drink of a cup of wine, mixed with the water of Zenjebil
76|18|a fountain in paradise named Salsabil
76|19|And youths, which shall continue for ever in their bloom, shall go round to attend them; when thou seest them, thou shalt think them to be scattered pearls
76|20|And when thou lookest, there shalt thou behold delights, and a great kingdom
76|21|Upon them shall be garments of fine green silk, and of brocades, and they shall be adorned with bracelets of silver: And their Lord shall give them to drink of a most pure liquor
76|22|and shall say unto them, verily this is your reward: And your endeavour is gratefully accepted
76|23|Verily We have sent down unto thee the Koran, by a gradual revelation
76|24|Wherefore patiently wait the judgment of thy Lord; and obey not any wicked person or unbeliever among them
76|25|And commemorate the name of thy Lord, in the morning, and in the evening
76|26|And during some part of the night worship Him, and praise Him a long part of the night
76|27|Verily these men love the transitory life, and leave behind them the heavy day of judgment
76|28|We have created them, and have strengthened their joints; and when We please, We will substitute others like unto them, in their stead
76|29|Verily this is an admonition: And whoso willeth, taketh the way unto his Lord
76|30|But ye shall not will, unless God willeth; for God is knowing, and wise
76|31|He leadeth whom He pleaseth into his mercy: But for the unjust hath He prepared a grievous punishment
77|1|By the angels which are sent by God, following one another in a continual series; and those which move swiftly
77|2|with a rapid motion
77|3|and by those which disperse his commands, by divulging them through the earth
77|4|and by those which separate truth from falsehood, by distinguishing the same
77|5|and by those which communicate the divine admonitions
77|6|to excuse, or to threaten
77|7|Verily that which ye are promised is inevitable
77|8|When the stars, therefore, shall be put out
77|9|and when the heaven shall be cloven in sunder
77|10|and when the mountains shall be winnowed
77|11|and when the apostles shall have a time assigned them to appear and bear testimony against their respective people
77|12|to what a day shall that appointment be deferred
77|13|To the day of separation
77|14|And what shall cause thee to understand what the day of separation is
77|15|On that day, woe be unto them who accused the prophets of imposture
77|16|Have We not destroyed the obstinate unbelievers of old
77|17|We will also cause those of the latter times to follow them
77|18|Thus do We deal with the wicked
77|19|Woe be, on that day, unto them who accused the prophets of imposture
77|20|Have We not created you of a contemptible drop of seed
77|21|which We placed in a sure repository
77|22|until the fixed term of delivery
77|23|And We were able to do this: For We are most powerful
77|24|On that day, woe be unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
77|25|Have We not made the earth to contain
77|26|the living and the dead
77|27|and placed therein stable and lofty mountains, and given you fresh water to drink
77|28|Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
77|29|It shall be said unto them, go ye to the punishment which ye denied as a falsehood
77|30|Go ye into the shadow of the smoke of hell, which shall ascend in three columns
77|31|and shall not shade you from the heat, neither shall it be of service against the flame
77|32|but it shall cast forth sparks as big as towers
77|33|resembling yellow camels in colour
77|34|Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
77|35|This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose
77|36|neither shall they be permitted to excuse themselves
77|37|Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
77|38|This shall be the day of separation: We will assemble both you and your predecessors
77|39|Whereofore, if ye have any cunning stratagem, employ stratagems against Me
77|40|Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
77|41|But the pious shall dwell amidst shades and fountains
77|42|and fruits of the kinds which they shall desire
77|43|And it shall be said unto them, eat and drink with easy digestion, in recompense for that which ye have wrought
77|44|for thus do We reward the righteous doers
77|45|Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
77|46|Eat, O unbelievers, and enjoy the pleasures of this life, for a little while: Verily ye are wicked men
77|47|Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
77|48|And when it is said unto them, bow down; they do not bow down
77|49|Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
77|50|In what new revelation will they believe, after this
78|1|Concerning what do the unbelievers ask questions of one another
78|2|Concerning the great news of the resurrection
78|3|about which they disagree
78|4|Assuredly they shall hereafter know the truth thereof
78|5|Again, assuredly they shall hereafter know the truth thereof
78|6|Have We not made the earth for a bed
78|7|and the mountains for stakes to fix the same
78|8|And have We not created you of two sexes
78|9|and appointed your sleep for rest
78|10|and made the night a garment to cover you
78|11|and destined the day to the gaining your livelihood
78|12|and built over you seven solid heavens
78|13|and placed therein a burning lamp
78|14|And do We not send down from the clouds pressing forth rain, water pouring down in abundance
78|15|that We may thereby produce corn, and herbs
78|16|and gardens planted thick with trees
78|17|Verily the day of separation is a fixed period
78|18|The day whereon the trumpet shall sound, and ye shall come in troops to judgment
78|19|and the heaven shall be opened, and shall be full of gates for the angels to pass through
78|20|and the mountains shall pass away, and become as a vapour
78|21|verily hell shall be a place of ambush
78|22|a receptacle for the transgressors
78|23|who shall remain therein for ages
78|24|They shall not taste any refreshment therein, or any drink
78|25|except boiling water, and filthy corruption
78|26|A fit recompense for their deeds
78|27|For they hoped that they should not be brought to an account
78|28|and they disbelieved our signs, accusing them of falsehood
78|29|But every thing have We computed, and written down
78|30|Taste, therefore: We will not add unto you any other than torment
78|31|But for the pious is prepared a place of bliss
78|32|Gardens planted with trees, and vineyards
78|33|and damsels with swelling breasts, of equal age with themselves
78|34|and a full cup
78|35|They shall hear no vain discourse there, nor any falsehood
78|36|This shall be their recompense from thy Lord; a gift fully sufficient
78|37|From the Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them; the Merciful. The inhabitants of heaven or of earth shall not dare to demand audience of Him
78|38|The day whereon the spirit Gabriel, and the other angels shall stand in order, they shall not speak in behalf of themselves or others, except he only to whom the Merciful shall grant permission, and who shall say that which is right
78|39|This is the infallible day. Whoso, therefore, willeth, let him return unto his Lord
78|40|Verily We threaten you with a punishment nigh at hand: The day whereon a man shall behold the good or evil deeds which his hands have sent before him; and the unbeliever shall say, would to God I were dust
79|1|By the angels who tear forth the souls of some with violence
79|2|and by those who draw forth the souls of others with gentleness
79|3|by those who glide swimmingly through the air with the commands of God
79|4|and those who precede and usher the righteous to paradise
79|5|and those who subordinately govern the affairs of this world
79|6|On a certain day, the disturbing blast of the trumpet shall disturb the universe
79|7|and the subsequent blast shall follow it
79|8|On that day men's hearts shall tremble
79|9|Their looks shall be cast down
79|10|The infidels say, shall we surely be made to return whence we came
79|11|After we shall have become rotten bones, shall we be again raised to life
79|12|They say, this then will be a return to loss
79|13|Verily it will be but one sounding of the trumpet
79|14|and behold, they shall appear alive on the face of the earth
79|15|Hath not the story of Moses reached thee
79|16|When his Lord called unto him in the holy valley Towa, saying
79|17|go unto Pharaoh; for he is insolently wicked
79|18|and say, hast thou a desire to become just and holy
79|19|And I will direct thee unto thy Lord, that thou mayest fear to transgress
79|20|And he shewed him the very great sign of the rod turned into a serpent
79|21|But he charged Moses with imposture, and rebelled against God
79|22|Then he turned back hastily
79|23|and he assembled the magicians, and cried aloud, saying
79|24|I am your supreme Lord
79|25|Wherefore God chastised him with the punishment of the life to come, and also of this present life
79|26|Verily herein is an example unto him who feareth to rebel
79|27|Are ye more difficult to create, or the heaven which God hath built
79|28|He hath raised the height thereof, and hath perfectly formed the same
79|29|And He hath made the night thereof dark, and hath produced the light thereof
79|30|After this, He stretched out the earth
79|31|whence He caused to spring forth the water thereof, and the pasture thereof
79|32|and He established the mountains
79|33|for the use of yourselves, and of your cattle
79|34|When the prevailing, the great day shall come
79|35|on that day shall a man call to remembrance what he hath purposely done
79|36|And hell shall be exposed to the view of the spectator
79|37|And whoso shall have transgressed
79|38|and shall have chosen this present life
79|39|verily hell shall be his abode
79|40|But whoso shall have dreaded the appearing before his Lord, and shall have refrained his soul from lust
79|41|verily paradise shall be his abode
79|42|They will ask thee concerning the last hour, when will be the fixed time thereof
79|43|By what means canst thou give any information of the same
79|44|Unto thy Lord belongeth the knowledge of the period thereof
79|45|And thou art only a warner, who fearest the same
79|46|The day whereon they shall see the same, it shall seem to them as though they had not tarried in the world longer than an evening, or a morning thereof
80|1|The prophet frowned, and turned aside
80|2|because the blind man came unto him
80|3|And how dost thou know whether he shall peradventure be cleansed from his sins
80|4|or whether he shall be admonished, and the admonition shall profit him
80|5|The man who is wealthy
80|6|thou receivest respectfully
80|7|whereas it is not to be charged on thee, that he is not cleansed
80|8|But him who cometh unto thee earnestly seeking his salvation
80|9|and who feareth God
80|10|dost thou neglect
80|11|By no means shouldest thou act thus
80|12|Verily the Koran is an admonition; -- and he who is willing retaineth the same
80|13|written in volumes honourable
80|14|exalted, and pure
80|15|by the hands of scribes honoured
80|16|and just
80|17|May man be cursed! What hath seduced him to infidelity
80|18|Of what thing doth God create him
80|19|Of a drop of seed doth He create him; and He formeth him with proportion
80|20|and then facilitateth his passage out of the womb
80|21|Afterwards He causeth him to die, and layeth him in the grave
80|22|hereafter, when it shall please Him, He shall raise him to life
80|23|Assuredly. He hath not hitherto fully performed what God hath commanded him
80|24|Let man consider his food; in what manner it is provided
80|25|We pour down water by showers
80|26|afterwards We cleave the earth in clefts
80|27|and We cause corn to spring forth therein
80|28|and grapes, and clover
80|29|and the olive, and the palm
80|30|and gardens planted thick with trees
80|31|and fruits, and grass
80|32|for the use of yourselves and of your cattle
80|33|When the stunning sound of the trumpet shall be heard
80|34|on that day shall a man fly from his brother
80|35|and his mother, and his father
80|36|and his wife, and his children
80|37|Every man of them, on that day, shall have business of his own sufficient to employ his thoughts
80|38|On that day the faces of some shall be bright
80|39|laughing, and joyful
80|40|And upon the faces of others, on that day, shall there be dust
80|41|darkness shall cover them
80|42|These are the unbelievers, the wicked
81|1|When the sun shall be folded up
81|2|and when the stars shall fall
81|3|and when the mountains shall be made to pass away
81|4|and when the camels ten months gone with young shall be neglected
81|5|and when the wild beasts shall be gathered together
81|6|and when the seas shall boil
81|7|and when the souls shall be joined again to their bodies
81|8|and when the girl who hath been buried alive shall be asked
81|9|for what crime she was put to death
81|10|and when the books shall be laid open
81|11|and when the heaven shall be removed
81|12|and when hell shall burn fiercely
81|13|and when paradise shall be brought near
81|14|Every soul shall know what it hath wrought
81|15|Verily I swear by the stars which are retrograde
81|16|which move swiftly, and which hide themselves
81|17|and by the night, when it cometh on
81|18|and by the morning, when it appeareth
81|19|that these are the words of an honourable messenger
81|20|endued with strengeth, of established dignity in the sight of the possessor of the throne
81|21|obeyed by the angels under his authority, and faithful
81|22|And your companion Mohammed is not distracted
81|23|He had already seen him in the clear horizon
81|24|And he suspected not the secrets revealed unto him
81|25|Neither are these the words of an accursed devil
81|26|Whither, therefore, are ye going
81|27|This is no other than an admonition unto all creatures
81|28|unto him among you who shall be willing to walk uprightly
81|29|But ye shall not will, unless God willeth, the Lord of all creatures
82|1|When the heaven shall be cloven in sunder
82|2|and when the stars shall be scattered
82|3|and when the seas shall be suffered to join their waters
82|4|and when the graves shall be turned upside down
82|5|Every soul shall know what it hath committed, and what it hath omitted
82|6|O man, what hath seduced thee against thy gracious Lord
82|7|who hath created thee, and put thee together
82|8|and rightly disposed thee? In what form He pleased hath He fashioned thee
82|9|Assuredly. But ye deny the last judgment as a falsehood
82|10|Verily there are appointed over you guardian angels
82|11|honourable in the sight of God, writing down your actions
82|12|who know that which ye do
82|13|The just shall surely be in a place of delight
82|14|But the wicked shall surely be in hell
82|15|they shall be cast therein to be burned, on the day of judgment
82|16|and they shall not be absent therefrom for ever
82|17|What shall cause thee to understand what the day of judgment is
82|18|Again, what shall cause thee to understand what the day of judgment is
82|19|It is a day whereon one soul shall not be able to obtain any thing in behalf of another soul: And the command, on that day, shall be God's
83|1|Woe be unto those who give short measure or weight
83|2|who, when they receive by measure from other men, take the full
83|3|but when they measure unto them, or weigh unto them, defraud
83|4|Do not these think they shall be raised again
83|5|at the great day
83|6|the day whereon mankind shall stand before the Lord of all creatures
83|7|By no means. Verily the register of the actions of the wicked is surely in Sejjin
83|8|And what shall make thee to understand what Sejjin is
83|9|It is a book distinctly written
83|10|Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
83|11|who denied the day of judgment as a falsehood
83|12|And none denieth the same as falsehood, except every unjust and flagitious person
83|13|Who, when our signs are rehearsed unto him, saith, they are fables of the ancients
83|14|By no means: But rather their lusts have cast a veil over their hearts
83|15|By no means. Verily they shall be shut out from their Lord on that day
83|16|and they shall be sent into hell to be burned
83|17|Then shall it be said unto them, by the infernal guards, this is what ye denied as a falsehood
83|18|Assuredly. But the register of the actions of the righteous is in Illiyyun
83|19|And what shall cause thee to understand what Illiyyun is
83|20|It is a book distinctly written
83|21|Those who approach near unto God, are witnesses thereto
83|22|Verily the righteous shall dwell among delights
83|23|Seated on couches they shall behold objects of pleasure
83|24|thou shalt see in their faces the brightness of joy
83|25|They shall be given to drink of pure wine, sealed
83|26|the seal whereof shall be musk: And to this let those aspire, who aspire to happiness
83|27|And the water mixed therewith shall be of Tasnim
83|28|a fountain whereof those shall drink who approach near unto the divine presence
83|29|They who act wickedly laugh the true believers to scorn
83|30|and when they pass by them, they wink at one another
83|31|And when they turn aside to their people, they turn aside making scurrilous jests
83|32|And when they see them, they say, verily these are mistaken men
83|33|But they are not sent to be keepers over them
83|34|Wherefore one day the true believers, in their turn, shall laugh the infidels to scorn
83|35|Lying on couches they shall look down upon them in hell
83|36|Shall not the infidels be rewarded for that which they have done
84|1|When the heaven shall be rent in sunder
84|2|and shall obey its Lord, and shall be capable thereof
84|3|and when the earth shall be stretched out
84|4|and shall cast forth that which is therein, and shall remain empty
84|5|and shall obey its Lord, and shall be capable thereof
84|6|O man, verily labouring thou labourest to meet thy Lord, and thou shalt meet Him
84|7|And he who shall have his book given into his right hand
84|8|shall be called to an easy account
84|9|and shall turn unto his family with joy
84|10|But he who shall have his book given him behind his back
84|11|shall invoke destruction to fall upon him
84|12|and he shall be sent into hell to be burned
84|13|because he rejoiced insolently amidst his family on earth
84|14|Verily he thought that he should never return unto God
84|15|Yea verily; but his Lord beheld him
84|16|Wherefore I swear by the redness of the sky after sun-set
84|17|and by the night, and the animals which it driveth together
84|18|and by the moon when she is at the full
84|19|ye shall surely be transferred successively from state to state
84|20|What aileth them, therefore, that they believe not the resurrection
84|21|and that, when the Koran is read unto them, they worship not
84|22|Yea: The unbelievers accuse the same of imposture
84|23|But God well knoweth the malice which they keep hidden in their breasts
84|24|Wherefore denounce unto them a grievous punishment
84|25|except those who believe and do good works: For them is prepared a never failing reward
85|1|By the heaven adorned with signs
85|2|by the promised day of judgment
85|3|by the witness, and the witnessed
85|4|cursed were the contrivers of the pit
85|5|of fire supplied with fuel
85|6|when they sat round the same
85|7|and were witnesses of what they did against the true believers
85|8|And they afflicted them for no other reason, but because they believed in the mighty, the glorious God
85|9|unto whom belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth: And God is witness of all things
85|10|Verily for those who persecute the true believers of either sex, and afterwards repent not, is prepared the torment of hell; and they shall suffer the pain of burning
85|11|But for those who believe, and do that which is right, are destined gardens beneath which rivers flow: This shall be great felicity
85|12|Verily the vengeance of thy Lord is severe
85|13|He createth, and He restoreth to life
85|14|He is inclined to forgive, and gracious
85|15|The possessor of the glorious throne
85|16|who effecteth that which He pleaseth
85|17|Hath not the story of the hosts
85|18|of Pharaoh, and of Thamud, reached thee
85|19|Yet the unbelievers cease not to accuse the divine revelations of falsehood
85|20|But God encompasseth them behind, that they cannot escape
85|21|Verily that which they reject is a glorious Koran
85|22|the original whereof is written in a table kept in heaven
86|1|By the heaven, and that which appeareth by night
86|2|But what shall cause thee to understand what that which appeareth by night is
86|3|It is the star of piercing brightness
86|4|Every soul hath a guardian set over it
86|5|Let a man consider, therefore, of what he is created
86|6|He is created of seed poured forth
86|7|issuing from the loins, and the breast-bones
86|8|Verily God is able to restore him to life
86|9|the day whereon all secret thoughts and actions shall be examined into
86|10|and he shall have no power to defend himself, nor any protector
86|11|By the heaven which returneth the rain
86|12|and by the earth which openeth to let forth vegetables and springs
86|13|Verily this is a discourse distinguishing good from evil
86|14|and it is not composed with lightness
86|15|Verily the infidels are laying a plot to frustrate my designs
86|16|But I will lay a plot for their ruin
86|17|Wherefore, O prophet, bear with the unbelievers: Let them alone a while
87|1|Praise the name of thy Lord, the most high
87|2|Who hath created, and completely formed his creatures
87|3|And Who determineth them to various ends, and directeth them to attain the same
87|4|and who produceth the pasture for cattle
87|5|and afterwards rendereth the same dry stubble of a dusky hue
87|6|We will enable thee to rehearse our revelations; and thou shalt not forget any part thereof
87|7|except what God shall please; for He knoweth that which is manifest, and that which is hidden
87|8|And We will facilitate unto thee the most easy way
87|9|Wherefore admonish thy people, if thy admonition shall be profitable unto them
87|10|Whoso feareth God, he will be admonished
87|11|But the most wretched unbeliever will turn away therefrom
87|12|who shall be cast to be broiled in the greater fire of hell
87|13|wherein he shall not die, neither shall he live
87|14|Now hath he attained felicity who is purified by faith
87|15|and who remembereth the name of his Lord, and prayeth
87|16|But ye prefer this present life
87|17|Yet the life to come is better, and more durable
87|18|Verily this is written in the ancient books
87|19|the books of Abraham and Moses
88|1|Hath the news of the overwhelming day of judgment reached thee
88|2|The countenances of some, on that day, shall be cast down
88|3|labouring and toiling
88|4|They shall be cast into scorching fire to be broiled
88|5|They shall be given to drink of a boiling fountain
88|6|They shall have no food, but of dry thorns and thistles
88|7|which shall not fatten, neither shall they satisfy hunger
88|8|But the countenances of others, on that day, shall be joyful
88|9|well pleased with their past endeavour
88|10|They shall be placed in a lofty garden
88|11|wherein thou shalt hear no vain discourse
88|12|Therein shall be a running fountain
88|13|Therein shall be raised beds
88|14|and goblets placed before them
88|15|and cushions laid in order
88|16|and carpets ready spread
88|17|Do they not consider the camels, how they are created
88|18|and the heaven, how it is raised
88|19|and the mountains, how they are fixed
88|20|and the earth, how it is extended
88|21|Wherefore warn thy people; for thou art a warner only
88|22|Thou art not impowered to act with authority over them
88|23|But whoever shall turn back, and disbelieve
88|24|God shall punish him with the greater punishment of the life to come
88|25|Verily unto us shall they return
88|26|Then shall it be our part to bring them to account
89|1|By the day-break
89|2|and then nights
89|3|by that which is double, and that which is single
89|4|and by the night when it cometh on
89|5|Is there not in this an oath formed with understanding
89|6|Hast thou not considered how thy Lord dealt with Ad
89|7|the people of Irem, adorned with lofty buildings
89|8|the like whereof hath not been erected in the land
89|9|and with Thamud, who hewed the rocks in the valley into houses
89|10|and with Pharaoh, the contriver of the stakes
89|11|Who had behaved insolently in the earth
89|12|and multiplied corruption therein
89|13|Wherefore thy Lord poured on them various kinds of chastisement
89|14|For thy Lord is surely in a watch-tower, whence He observeth the actions of men
89|15|Moreover man, when his Lord trieth him by prosperity, and honoureth him, and is bounteous unto him, saith, my Lord honoureth me
89|16|But when He proveth him by afflictions, and withholdeth his provisions from him, he saith, my Lord despiseth me
89|17|By no means: But ye honour not the orphan
89|18|neither do ye excite one another to feed the poor
89|19|and ye devour the inheritance of the weak, with undistinguishing greediness
89|20|and ye love riches, with much affection
89|21|By no means should ye do thus. When the earth shall be minutely ground to dust
89|22|and thy Lord shall come, and the angels rank by rank
89|23|and hell, on that day, shall be brought nigh: On that day shall man call to remembrance his evil deeds; but how shall remembrance avail him
89|24|He shall say, would to God that I had heretofore done good works in my life-time
89|25|On that day none shall punish with his punishment
89|26|nor shall any bind with his bonds
89|27|O thou soul which art at rest
89|28|return unto thy Lord, well pleased with thy reward, and well pleasing unto God
89|29|Enter among my servants
89|30|and enter my paradise
90|1|I swear by this territory
90|2|and thou, O prophet, residest in this territory
90|3|and by the begetter, and that which He hath begotten
90|4|verily We have created man in misery
90|5|Doth he think that none shall prevail over him
90|6|He saith, I have wasted plenty of riches
90|7|Doth he think that none seeth him
90|8|Have we not made him two eyes
90|9|and a tongue, and two lips
90|10|and shewn him the two highways of good and evil
90|11|Yet he attempteth not the cliff
90|12|What shall make thee to understand what the cliff is
90|13|It is to free the captive
90|14|or to feed, in the day of famine
90|15|the orphan who is of kin
90|16|or the poor man who lieth on the ground
90|17|Whoso doth this, and is one of those who believe, and recommend perseverance unto each other, and recommend mercy unto each other
90|18|these shall be the companions of the right-hand
90|19|But they who shall disbelieve our signs, shall be the companions of the left-hand
90|20|Above them shall be arched fire
91|1|By the sun, and its rising brightness
91|2|by the moon, when she followeth him
91|3|by the day, when it sheweth his splendor
91|4|by the night, when it covereth him with darkness
91|5|by the heaven, and Him who built it
91|6|by the earth, and Him who spread it forth
91|7|by the soul, and Him who completely formed it
91|8|and inspired into the same its faculty of distinguishing, and power of choosing, wickedness and piety
91|9|Now is he who hath purified the same, happy
91|10|but he who hath corrupted the same, is miserable
91|11|Thamud accused their prophet Saleh of imposture, through the excess of their wickedness
91|12|When the wretch among them was sent to slay the camel
91|13|and the apostle of God said unto them, let alone the camel of God; and hinder not her drinking
91|14|But they charged him with imposture; and they slew her. Wherefore their Lord destroyed them, for their crime, and made their punishment equal unto them all
91|15|And he feareth not the issue thereof
92|1|By the night, when it covereth all things with darkness
92|2|by the day, when it shineth forth
92|3|by Him who hath created the male, and the female
92|4|Verily your endeavour is different
92|5|Now whoso is obedient, and feareth God
92|6|and professeth the truth of that faith which is most excellent
92|7|unto him will We facilitate the way to happiness
92|8|But whoso shall be covetous, and shall be wholly taken up with this world
92|9|and shall deny the truth of that which is most excellent
92|10|unto him will We facilitate the way to misery
92|11|and his riches shall not profit him, when he shall fall headlong into hell
92|12|Verily unto Us appertaineth the direction of mankind
92|13|And ours is the life to come, and the present life
92|14|Wherefore I threaten you with fire which burneth fiercely
92|15|which none shall enter to be burned except the most wretched
92|16|who shall have disbelieved, and turned back
92|17|But he who strictly bewareth idolatry and rebellion, shall be removed far from the same
92|18|who giveth his substance in alms
92|19|and by whom no benefit is bestowed on any, that it may be recompensed
92|20|but who bestoweth the same for the sake of his Lord, the most High
92|21|And hereafter he shall be well satisfied with his reward
93|1|By the brightness of the morning
93|2|and by the night, when it groweth dark
93|3|Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither doth He hate thee
93|4|Verily the life to come shall be better for thee than this present life
93|5|And thy Lord shall give thee a reward wherewith thou shalt be well pleased
93|6|Did He not find thee an orphan, and hath He not taken care of thee
93|7|And did He not find thee wandering in error, and hath He not guided thee into the truth
93|8|And did He not find thee needy, and hath He not enriched thee
93|9|Wherefore oppress not the orphan
93|10|neither repulse the beggar
93|11|But declare the goodness of thy Lord
94|1|Have We not opened thy breast
94|2|and eased thee of thy burden
94|3|which galled thy back
94|4|and raised thy reputation for thee
94|5|Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease
94|6|Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease
94|7|When thou shalt have ended thy preaching, labour to serve God in return for his favours
94|8|and make thy supplication unto thy Lord
95|1|By the fig, and the olive
95|2|and by mount Sinai
95|3|and this territory of security
95|4|Verily We created man of a most excellent fabric
95|5|afterwards We rendered him the vilest of the vile
95|6|Except those who believe, and work righteousness; for they shall receive an endless reward
95|7|What therefore shall cause thee to deny the day of judgment after this
95|8|Is not God the most wise judge
96|1|Read, in the name of thy Lord, Who hath created all things
96|2|who hath created man of congealed blood
96|3|Read, by thy most beneficent Lord
96|4|Who taught the use of the pen
96|5|Who teacheth man that which he knoweth not
96|6|Assuredly. Verily man becometh insolent
96|7|because he seeth himself abound in riches
96|8|Verily unto thy Lord shall be the return of all
96|9|What thinkest thou as to him
96|10|who forbiddeth our servant, when he prayeth
96|11|What thinkest thou; if he follow the right direction
96|12|or command piety
96|13|What thinkest thou; if he accuse the divine revelations of falsehood, and turn his back
96|14|Doth he not know that God seeth
96|15|Assuredly. Verily, if he forbear not, We will drag him by the forelock
96|16|the lying, sinful forelock
96|17|And let him call his council to his assistance
96|18|We also will call the infernal guards to cast him into hell
96|19|Assuredly. Obey him not: But continue to adore God; and draw nigh unto Him
97|1|Verily We sent down the Koran in the night of al Kadr
97|2|And what shall make thee understand how excellent the night of al Kadr is
97|3|The night of al Kadr is better than a thousand months
97|4|Therein do the angels descend, and the spirit Gabriel also, by the permission of their Lord, with his decrees concerning every matter
97|5|It is peace, until the rising of the morn
98|1|The unbelievers among those to whom the scriptures were given, and among the idolaters, did not stagger, until the clear evidence had come unto them
98|2|An apostle from God, rehearsing unto them pure books of revelations
98|3|wherein are contained right discourses
98|4|Neither were they unto whom the scriptures were given divided among themselves, until after the clear evidence had come unto them
98|5|And they were commanded no other in the scriptures than to worship God, exhibiting unto him the pure religion, and being orthodox; and to be constant at prayer, and to give alms: And this is the right religion
98|6|Verily those who believe not, among those who have received the scriptures, and among the idolaters, shall be cast into the fire of hell, to remain therein for ever. These are the worst of creatures
98|7|But they who believe, and do good works; these are the best of creatures
98|8|Their reward with their Lord shall be gardens of perpetual abode, through which rivers flow; they shall remain therein for ever. God will be well pleased in them; and they shall be well pleased in him. This is prepared for him who shall fear his Lord
99|1|When the earth shall be shaken by an earthquake
99|2|and the earth shall cast forth her burdens
99|3|and a man shall say, what aileth her
99|4|On that day the earth shall declare her tidings
99|5|for that thy Lord will inspire her
99|6|On that day men shall go forward in distinct classes, that they may behold their works
99|7|And whoever shall have wrought good of the weight of an ant, shall behold the same
99|8|And whoever shall have wrought evil of the weight of an ant, shall behold the same
100|1|By the war-horses which run swiftly to the battle, with a panting noise
100|2|and by those which strike fire, by dashing their hoofs against the stones
100|3|and by those which make a sudden incursion on the enemy early in the morning
100|4|and therein raise the dust
100|5|and therein pass through the midst of the adverse troops
100|6|Verily man is ungrateful unto his Lord
100|7|and he is witness thereof
100|8|And he is immoderate in the love of worldly good
100|9|Doth he not know, therefore, when that which is in the graves shall be taken forth
100|10|and that which is in men's breasts shall be brought to light
100|11|that their Lord will, on that day, be fully informed concerning them
101|1|The striking
101|2|What is the striking
101|3|And what shall make thee to understand how terrible the striking will be
101|4|On that day men shall be like moths scattered abroad
101|5|and the mountains shall become like carded wool of various colours driven by the wind
101|6|Moreover he whose balance shall be heavy with good works
101|7|shall lead a pleasing life
101|8|But as to him whose balance shall be light
101|9|his dwelling shall be the pit of hell
101|10|What shall make thee to understand how frightful the pit of hell is
101|11|It is a burning fire
102|1|The emulous desire of multiplying riches and children employeth you
102|2|until ye visit the graves
102|3|By no means should ye thus employ your time: Hereafter shall ye know your folly
102|4|Again, by no means: Hereafter shall ye know your folly
102|5|By no means: If ye knew the consequence hereof with certainty of knowledge, ye would not act thus
102|6|Verily ye shall see hell
102|7|Again, ye shall surely see it with the eye of certainty
102|8|Then shall ye be examined, on that day, concerning the pleasures with which ye have amused yourselves in this life
103|1|By the afternoon
103|2|verily man employeth himself in that which will prove of loss
103|3|Except those who believe, and do that which is right; and who mutually recommend the truth, and mutually recommend perseverance unto each other
104|1|Woe unto every slanderer, and backbiter
104|2|Who heapeth up riches, and prepareth the same for the time to come
104|3|He thinketh that his riches will render him immortal
104|4|By no means. He shall surely be cast into al Hotama
104|5|And what shall cause thee to understand what al Hotama is
104|6|It is the kindled fire of God
104|7|which shall mount above the hearts of those who shall be cast therein
104|8|Verily it shall be as an arched vault above them
104|9|on columns of vast extent
105|1|Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the masters of the elephant
105|2|Did He not make their treacherous design an occasion of drawing them into error
105|3|and send against them flocks of birds
105|4|which cast down upon them stones of baked clay
105|5|and render them like the leaves of corn eaten by cattle
106|1|For the uniting of the tribe of Koreish
106|2|their uniting in sending forth the caravan of merchants and purveyors in winter and summer
106|3|Let them serve the Lord of this house
106|4|who supplieth them with food against hunger, and hath rendered them secure from fear
107|1|What thinkest thou of him who denieth the future judgment as a falsehood
107|2|It is he who pusheth away the orphan
107|3|and stirreth not up others to feed the poor
107|4|Woe be unto those who pray
107|5|and who are negligent at their prayer
107|6|who play the hypocrites
107|7|and deny necessaries to the needy
108|1|Verily we have given thee al Cawthar
108|2|Wherefore pray unto thy Lord, and slay the victims
108|3|verily he who hateth thee shall be childless
109|1|Say: O unbelievers
109|2|I will not worship that which ye worship
109|3|nor will ye worship that which I worship
109|4|Neither do I worship that which ye worship
109|5|neither do ye worship that which I worship
109|6|Ye have your religion, and I my religion
110|1|When the assistance of God shall come, and the victory
110|2|and thou shalt see the people enter into the religion of God by troops
110|3|Celebrate the praise of thy Lord, and ask pardon of Him; for He is inclined to forgive
111|1|The hands of Abu Laheb shall perish, and he shall perish
111|2|His riches shall not profit him, neither that which he hath gained
111|3|He shall go down to be burned into flaming fire
111|4|and his wife also, bearing wood
111|5|having on her neck a cord of twisted fibres of a palm-tree
112|1|Say, God is one God
112|2|the eternal God
112|3|He begetteth not, neither is He begotten
112|4|And there is not any one like unto Him
113|1|Say, I fly for refuge unto the Lord of the day-break
113|2|that He may deliver me from the mischief of those things which He hath created
113|3|and from the mischief of the night, when it cometh on
113|4|and from the mischief of women blowing on knots
113|5|and from the mischief of the envious, when he envieth
114|1|Say, I fly for refuge unto the Lord of men
114|2|the King of men
114|3|the God of men
114|4|that He may deliver me from the mischief of the whisperer who slyly withdraweth
114|5|who whispereth evil suggestions into the breasts of men
114|6|from genii and men
