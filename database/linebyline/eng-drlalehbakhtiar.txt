In the Name of God, The Merciful, The Compassionate
The Praise belongs to God, Lord of the worlds
The Merciful, The Compassionate
One Who is Sovereign of the Day of Judgment
Thee alone we worship and to Thee alone we pray for help
Guide us on the straight path
the path of those to whom Thou wert gracious, not the ones against whom Thou art angry, nor the ones who go astray
Alif L[m M\m]
That is the Book—there is no doubt ^in it^, a guidance for the ones who are Godfearing
Those who believe in the unseen and perform the formal prayer and they spend from what We have provided them
and perform the formal prayer, and they spend out of what We provided them, and those who believe in what was caused to descend to thee, and what was caused to descend before thee, and they are certain of the world to come
Those are on a guidance from their Lord and those, they are the ones who prosper
Truly, as for those who were ungrateful, it is the same to them whether thou hadst warned them or thou hast warned them not. They believe not
God sealed over their hearts and over their inner hearing and a blindfold over their inner sight. And there is a tremendous punishment for them
And among humanity are some who say: We believed in God and in the Last Day, and yet they are not ones who believe
They seek to trick God and those who believed while they deceive none but themselves, but they are not aware
In their hearts is a sickness. Then, God increased them in sickness, and for them is a painful punishment because they had been lying against themselves
And when it was said to them not to make corruption in and on the earth, they said: Truly, we are only ones who make things right
No doubt they, they are the ones who make corruption except they are not aware
And when it was said to them: Believe as humanity believed, they said: Will we believe as the fools believed? No! Truly, they, they are the fools, except they know not
And when they met those who believed, they said: We believed. And when they went privately to their satans, they said: Truly, we are with you. We were only ones who ridicule
God ridicules them and causes them to increase in their defiance, to wander unwilling to see
Those are those who bought fallacy for guidance, so their trade was not bettered nor had they been ones who are truly guided
Their parable is like a parable of those who started a fire. Then, when it illuminated what was around it, God took away their light and left them in shadows where they perceive not
Unwilling to hear, unwilling to speak, unwilling to see, then, they will not return to the way
Or as a cloudburst from heaven in which there are shadows and thunder and lightning. They lay their fingertips in their ears from the thunderbolt, being fearful of death. And God is One Who Encloses the ones who are ungrateful
The lightning almost snatches their sight. When it illuminated for them, they walked in the light. And when it grew dark against them, they stood still. And if God willed, He would have taken away their having the ability to hear and their sight. Truly, God is Powerful over everything
O humanity! Worship your Lord Who created you and those who were before you so that perhaps you will be Godfearing
It is He Who assigned the earth for you as a place of restfulness and the heaven as a canopy. And He caused water to descend from heaven and from it drove out fruit of trees as provision for you. Then, assign not rivals to God while you, you know
And if you had been in doubt about what We sent down to Our servant, then approach with a Chapter of the Quran —the like of it— and call to your witnesses other than God if you had been ones who are sincere
And if you accomplish it not —and you will never accomplish it— then be Godfearing of the fire whose fuel is humanity and rocks, prepared for the ones who are ungrateful
And give good tidings to those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, that for them will be Gardens beneath which rivers run. Whenever they were provided from there of its fruit as provision they would say: This is what we were provided before. And they will be brought it —ones that resemble one another— and in it for them will be purified spouses. And they are ones who will dwell in them forever
Truly, God is not ashamed that He propound a parable, even of a gnat or whatever is above it. So as for those who believed, then, they know that it is The Truth from their Lord, but those who were ungrateful, then they will say: What did God mean by this parable? He causes many to go astray by it and He guides many by it. And He causes none to go astray by it, but the ones who disobey—
those who break the compact of God after a solemn promise and sever what God commanded that it be joined and make corruption in and on the earth. Those, they are the ones who are losers
How is it you are ungrateful to God? You had been lifeless, then, He gave you life. again, He will cause you to die. Again, He will give you life. And, again, you are returned to Him
It is He Who created for you all that is in and on the earth. Again, He turned His attention to the heaven. Then, He shaped them into seven heavens. And He is Knowing of everything
And when thy Lord said to the angels: Truly, I am assigning on the earth a viceregent. They said: Wilt Thou be One Who Makes on it someone who makes corruption on it and sheds blood, while we glorify Thy praise and sanctify Thee? He said: Truly, I know what you know not
And He taught Adam the names, all of them. Again, He presented them to the angels and said: Communicate to Me the names of these if you had been ones who are sincere
They said: Glory be to Thee! We have no knowledge but what Thou hadst taught us. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Knowing, The Wise
He said: O Adam! Communicate to them their names. So then, when he communicated to them their names, He said: Did I not say to you: Truly, I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and I know what you show and what you had been keeping back
And mention when We said to the angels: Prostrate yourselves to Adam! They, then, prostrated themselves but Iblis. He refused and grew arrogant. He had been among the ones who are ungrateful
And We said: O Adam! Inhabit the Garden, thou and thy spouse: Eat freely from it both of you wherever you both willed, but come not near this, the tree or you both will be among the ones who are unjust
Then, Satan caused both of them to slide back from there and drove both of them out from that in which they both had been. And We said: Get down some of you as an enemy to some other. And for you on the earth, a time appointed and sustenance for a while
Adam, then, received words from his Lord for He turned to him in forgiveness. Truly, He, He is The Accepter of Repentance, The Compassionate
We said: Get down altogether from it. And whenever guidance approaches you from Me, then, whoever heeded My guidance, then, there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse
But those who were ungrateful and denied Our signs, those will be the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever
O Children of Israel! Remember My divine blessing with which I was gracious to you and live up to the compact with Me. I will live up to the compact with you. And have reverence for Me alone
And believe in what I caused to descend, that which establishes as true what is with you. And be not the first one who is ungrateful for it. And exchange not My signs for a little price. And fear Me, God, alone
And confuse not The Truth with falsehood nor keep back The Truth while you know
And perform the formal prayer, and give the purifying alms, and bow down with the ones who bow down
You command humanity to virtuous conduct and forget yourselves while you relate the Book? Will you not, then, be reasonable
And pray for help with patience and formal prayer. And, truly, it is arduous, but for the ones who are humble
those who bear in mind that, truly, they, they will be ones who encounter their Lord and that to Him they will be ones who return
O Children of Israel! Remember My divine blessing with which I was gracious to you, and that I gave advantage to you over the worlds
And be Godfearing of a Day when no soul will give recompense for another soul at all, nor will intercession be accepted from it nor an equivalent be taken from it nor will they be helped
And mention when We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh who cause an affliction to befall you of a dire punishment. They slaughter your children and save alive your women. And in that there is a tremendous trial from your Lord
And mention when We separated the sea for you, and We rescued you, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh while you look on
And mention when We appointed for Moses forty nights. Again, you took the calf to yourselves after him and you were ones who are unjust
Again, We pardoned you after that, so that perhaps you will give thanks
And mention when We gave Moses the Book, and the Criterion between right and wrong, so that perhaps you will be truly guided
And mention when Moses said to his folk: O my folk! Truly, you did wrong to yourselves by your taking the calf to yourselves to worship, so repent to One Who is your Fashioner and kill yourselves. That would be better for you with One Who is your Fashioner. Then He will turn to you in forgiveness. Truly, He, He is The Accepter of Repentance, The Compassionate
And mention when you said: O Moses! We will never believe thee until we see God publicly. So the thunderbolt took you while you look on
Again, We will raise you up after your death so that perhaps you will give thanks
And We shaded over you cloud shadows. We caused to descend to you the manna and the quails. Eat of what is good that We provided you. And they did not wrong Us. Rather, they had been doing wrong to themselves
And mention when We said: Enter this town, then, eat freely from it whatever you willed, and enter the door as one who prostrates oneself and say: Unburden us of sin! We will forgive you your transgressions. And We will increase the ones who are doers of good
Then, those who did wrong substituted another saying —other than what was said to them— so We caused to descend on those who did wrong wrath from heaven, because they had been disobeying
And mention when Moses asked for water for his folk. Then, We said: Strike the rock with thy staff. Then, twelve springs ran out from it. Every clan knew their drinking place. Eat and drink from the provision of God, and do no mischief in and on the earth as ones who make corruption
And mention when you said: O Moses! We will never endure patiently with one kind of food, so call to thy Lord for us to drive out for us of what the earth is bringing forth of its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions. Moses said: Would you have in exchange what is lesser for what is higher? Get down to a settled country. Then, truly for you is what you asked for. And stamped on them were abasement and wretchedness. And they drew the burden of anger from God. That was because they had been ungrateful for the signs of God, and kill the Prophets without right. That, because they rebelled, and they had been exceeding the limits
Truly, those who believed, and those who became Jews, and the Christians and the Sabeans, whoever believed in God and the Last Day and did as one in accord with morality, then, for them, their compensation is with their Lord. And there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse
And when We took your solemn promise, and We exalted the mount above you: Take what We gave you with firmness, and remember what is in it, so that perhaps you will be Godfearing
Again, after that you turned away, and if it were not for the grace of God on you, and His mercy certainly, you would have been among the ones who are losers
And, certainly, you knew those who exceeded the limits among you on the Sabbath, to whom We said: Be you apes, ones who are driven away
Then, We made this an exemplary punishment for the former of them, and of succeeding generations, and an admonishment for the ones who are Godfearing
And mention when Moses said to his folk: Truly, God commands that you sacrifice a cow. They said: Hast thou taken us to thyself in mockery? He said: I take refuge with God that I be among the ones who are ignorant
They said: Call to thy Lord for us to make manifest to us what she is! Moses said: Truly, He says: She should be a cow that is neither old nor virgin —middle-aged between them— so accomplish what you are commanded
They said: Call to thy Lord for us to make manifest to us what hue she is. He said: Truly, He says: She is a saffron-colored cow —one that is bright in hue— that makes the ones who look on her joyous
They said: Call to thy Lord for us to make manifest to us what she is. Truly, cows resembled one another to us, and, truly, if God willed we would be ones who are truly guided
He said: Truly, He says she is a cow neither broken to plow the earth, nor to draw water for cultivation, that which is to be handed over without blemish on her. They said: Now thou hadst brought about The Truth. So they sacrificed her, and they almost accomplish it not
And mention when you killed a soul, then, you put up an argument over it. And God was One Who Drives Out what you had been keeping back
So We said: Turn him away with some of it! Thus, God gives life to the dead, and He causes you to see His signs, so that perhaps you will be reasonable
Again, after that, your hearts became hard, so that they were as rocks or harder in hardness. And, truly, from the rocks there are some that the rivers gush forth from it. And, truly, there are some that split open so water goes forth from it. And, truly, some that from it get down from dreading God. And God is not One Who is Heedless of what you do
Are you desirous that they believe in you? Surely, a group of people among them had been hearing the assertion of God. Yet again, they tamper with it after they were reasonable, and they know
And when they met those who believed, they said: We believed. And when they went privately—some of them with some others—they said: Will you divulge to them what God opened to you, so that they argue with you about it before your Lord? Will you not, then, be reasonable
Know they not that God knows what they keep secret, and what they speak openly
And among them are the unlettered who know nothing of the Book but fantasy. And, truly, they but surmise
And woe to those who write down the Book with their own hands. Again, they say: This is from God. Certainly, they exchange it for a little price. Then, woe to them for what their hands wrote down. And woe to them for what they earn
And they said: The fire will never touch us, but for numbered days. Say: Took you to yourselves a compact from God? If so, God never breaks His compact; or say you about God what you know not
Yea! Whoever earned an evil deed and is enclosed by his transgression, then those will be the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever
And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, those will be the Companions of the Garden. They, ones who will dwell in it forever
And mention when We took a solemn promise from the Children of Israel not to worship other than God, and goodness to the ones who are your parents and to the possessors of kinship and the orphans and the needy. And speak with kindness to humanity. And perform the formal prayer, and give the purifying alms. Again, you turned away but a few among you. You are ones who turn aside
And mention when We took your solemn promise: You will not shed your blood, nor drive yourselves out from your abodes. Again, you were in accord and you, you bear witness
Again, you are these—killing yourselves, and driving out a group of people among you from their abodes, to support one another against them in sin and deep seated dislike. And if they approach you as prisoners of war, you redeem them, although expelling them is that which is forbidden to you. Then, believe you in some of the Book, and are ungrateful for some? Then, what will be the recompense of whoever commits that among you, but degradation in this present life? And on the Day of Resurrection, they will be returned to the hardest punishment. And God is not One Who is Heedless of what you do
Those are those who bought this present life for the world to come, so the punishment on them will not be lightened, nor will they be helped
And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book and We sent Messengers following after him. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear portents, and confirmed him with the hallowed Spirit. Is it that whenever a Messenger drew near you with what you yourselves yearn not for, you grew arrogant, and you denied a group of people, and you kill a group of people
And they said: Our hearts are encased! Nay! God cursed them for their ingratitude, so little is what they believe
Mention when a Book from God drew near them, that which establishes as true what was with them—and before that they had been asking for victory over those who were ungrateful—so when drew near them what they recognized, they were ungrateful for it. Then, the curse of God is on the ones who are ungrateful
Miserable was that for which they sold out themselves for it, that they are ungrateful for what God caused to descend, resenting that God sends down of His grace on whom He wills of His servants. They drew the burden of anger on anger. And for the ones who are ungrateful, there is a despised punishment
And when it was said to them to believe in what God caused to descend, they said: We believe in what was caused to descend to us. And they are ungrateful for what is beyond it, while it is The Truth, that which establishes as true what is with them. Say: Why, then, kill you the Prophets of God before if you had been ones who believe
And, certainly, Moses drew near you with the clear portents. Again, you took the calf to yourselves after him. And you are ones who are unjust
And mention when We took your solemn promise, and We exalted the mount above you: Take what We gave you with firmness and hear. They said: We heard and we rebelled, and they were steeped with love for the calf in their hearts because of their ingratitude. Say: Miserable was what commands you to it of your belief if you had been ones who believe
Say: If the Last Abode for you had been with God —that which is exclusively for you— excluding others of humanity— then, covet death if you had been ones who are sincere
And they never covet it ever because of what their hands put forward, and God is Knowing of the ones who are unjust
And, certainly, thou wilt find them to be eager among humanity for this life, even of those who ascribed partners with God. Each one of them wishes that he be given a long life of a thousand years, yet he still would not be one who is drawn away from the punishment, even if he be given a long life, and God is Seeing of what they do
Say: Whoever had been an enemy of Gabriel knows, then, truly, it was sent down through him to thy heart with the permission of God, that which establishes as true what was before it, and as a guidance and good tidings for the ones who believe
Whoever had been an enemy of God and His angels, and His Messengers and Gabriel and Michael, then, truly, God is an enemy of the ones who are ungrateful
And, certainly, We caused to descend to thee signs, clear portents. And none are ungrateful for them, but the ones who disobey
Is it not that whenever they made a contract—a compact— a group of people among them repudiated it? Nay! Most of them believe not
And when a Messenger drew near them from God—one who establishes as true what was with them— a group of people repudiated among those who were given the Book, the Book of God—behind their backs as if they had not been knowing that it was God’s Book
And they followed what the satans recount during the dominion of Solomon. And Solomon was not ungrateful, except the satans were ungrateful. They teach humanity sorcery, and what was caused to descend to the two angels at Babylon—Harut and Marut. But neither of these two teach anyone unless they say: We are only a test, so be not ungrateful. And they learn from these two that by it they separate and divide between a man and his spouse. And they were not ones who injured anyone with it, but by the permission of God. And they learn what hurts them and profits them not. And, certainly, they knew that whoever bought it, for him in the world to come was not any apportionment. And miserable was that for which they sold themselves. Would that they had been knowing
And if they believed and were Godfearing, certainly, their place of spiritual reward from God was better. Would that they had been knowing
O those who believed! Say not: Look at us, but say: Wait for us patiently and hear. And for the ones who are ungrateful, there is a painful punishment
Neither wish those who were ungrateful from among the People of the Book, nor the ones who are polytheists that any good be sent down to you from your Lord. And God singles out for His mercy whom He wills. And God is Possessor of the Sublime Grace
For whatever sign We nullify or cause it to be forgotten, We bring better than it, or similar to it. Hast thou not known that God is Powerful over everything
Hast thou not known that God, to Him is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and not for you other than God is there either a protector or a helper
Or want you that you ask your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever takes disbelief in exchange for belief, then, surely, he went astray from the right way
Many of the People of the Book wished that after your belief they return you to being one who is ungrateful out of jealousy within themselves even after The Truth became clear to them. So pardon and overlook them until God brings His command. Truly, God is Powerful over everything
And perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves, you will find it with God. Truly, God is Seeing of what you do
And they said: None will enter the Garden, but ones who had been Jews or Christians. That is their own fantasies. Say: Prepare your proof if you had been ones who are sincere
Yea! Whoever submitted his face to God, and he is one who is a doer of good, then, for him his compensation is with his Lord. And there will be neither fear in them, nor will they feel remorse
And the Jews said: The Christians are not based on anything. And the Christians said: The Jews are not based on anything, although they both recount the Book. Thus, said those who know not a thing like their saying. So God will give judgment between them on the Day of Resurrection about what they had been at variance in it
And who does greater wrong than those who prevented access to the places of prostration to God so that His Name not be remembered in them, and endeavored for their devastation? It had not been for those to enter them, but as ones who are fearful. For them is degradation in the present, and for them is a tremendous punishment in the world to come
And to God belongs the East and the West. So wherever you turn to, then, again, there is the Countenance of God. Truly, God is One Who is Extensive, Knowing
And they said: God took to Himself a son. Glory be to Him! Nay! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are ones who are morally obligated to Him
Beginner of the heavens and the earth and when He decreed a command, then, truly, He says to it: Be! Then, it is
And those who know not said: Why does God not speak to us or a sign approach us? Thus, said those who were before them like their saying.• Their hearts resembled one another. Surely, We made manifest the signs for a folk who are certain
Truly, We sent thee with The Truth as a bearer of good tidings and as a warner. And thou wilt not be asked about the Companions of Hellfire
The Jews will never be well-pleased with thee, nor the Christians until thou hast followed their creed. Say: Truly, guidance of God. It is the guidance. And if thou hadst followed their desires after what drew near thee of the knowledge, there is not for thee from God either a protector or a helper
Those to whom We gave the Book recount it with a true recounting. Those believe in it, and whoever is ungrateful for it, then, those, they are the ones who are losers
O Children of Israel! Remember My divine blessing with which I was gracious to you, and that I gave you an advantage over the worlds
And be Godfearing of a Day when no soul will give recompense for another soul at all, nor will the equivalent be accepted from it, nor will intercession profit it , nor will they be helped
And mention when his Lord tested Abraham with words; then, he fulfilled them. God said: Truly, I am One Who Makes thee a leader for humanity. He said: And of my offspring? He said: Attain not My compact the ones who are unjust
And mention when We made the House a place of spiritual reward for humanity and a place of sanctuary: And take the Station of Abraham to yourselves as a place of prayer. And We made a compact with Abraham, and Ishmael saying that: Purify My House for the ones who circumambulate it, and the ones who cleave to it, and the ones who bow down, and the ones who prostrate themselves
And mention when Abraham said: My Lord! Make this a safe land, and provide its people with fruits, whomever of them believed in God and the Last Day. God said: And whoever is ungrateful, I will give him enjoyment for a while. Again, I will compel him to the punishment of the fire. And miserable will be the Homecoming
And mention when Abraham elevates the foundations of the House with Ishmael saying: Our Lord! Receive it from us. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Hearing, The Knowing
Our Lord! And make us ones who submit to Thee, and, of our offspring, a community of ones who submit to Thee. And cause us to see our devotional acts, and turn to us in forgiveness. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Accepter of Repentance, The Compassionate
Our Lord! And raise Thou up, then, in the midst of them, a Messenger from among them who will recount to them Thy signs and teach them the Book, and wisdom and make them pure. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Almighty, The Wise
And who shrinks from the creed of Abraham, but he who fooled himself? And, certainly, We favored him in the present. And, truly, in the world to come he will be among the ones in accord with morality
When his Lord said to him: Submit! He said: I submitted to the Lord of the worlds
And Abraham charged his children to it, and Jacob: O my children! Truly, God favored the way of life for you. Then, be not overtaken by death but you be ones who submit to the One God
Or had you been witnesses when death attended Jacob when he said to his children: How will you worship after me? They said: We will worship thy God and the God of thy fathers—Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac—One God. And we are ones who submit to Him
That was, surely, a community that passed away. For them is what they earned, and for you is what you earned and you will not be asked about what they had been doing
And they said: Be you ones who are Jews or Christians, you will be truly guided. Say thou: Nay! We follow the creed of Abraham a monotheist. And he had not been of the ones who are polytheists
Say: We believed in God and what was caused to descend to us, and what was caused to descend to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes and whatever was given Moses and Jesus, and whatever was given to the Prophets from their Lord. We separate and divide not between anyone of them. And we are ones who submit to Him
So if they believed the like of what you believed in it, then, surely, they were truly guided. And if they turned away, then, they are not but in breach. So God suffices for you against them. And He is The Hearing, The Knowing
Life’s color is from God. And who is fairer at coloring than God? And we are ones who worship Him
Say: Argue you with us about God? And He is our Lord and your Lord. And to us are our actions, and to you are your actions. And we are to Him ones who are sincere and devoted
Or say you about Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes had been ones who became Jews or were Christians? Say: Are you greater in knowledge or God? And who does greater wrong than he who had been keeping back testimony from God that is with him, and God is not One Who is Heedless of what you do
That is a community that surely passed away; for it is what it earned and for you is what you earned and you will not be asked about what they had been doing
The fools among humanity say: What turned them from their direction of formal prayer to which they had been towards? Say: To God belongs the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to a straight path
And, thus, We made you a middle community that you be witnesses to humanity, and that the Messenger be a witness to you. And We made not the direction of the formal prayer which thou hadst been towards but that We make evident whoever follows the Messenger from him who turns about on his two heels. And, truly, it had been grave, but for those whom God guided. And God had not been wasting your belief. Truly, God is Gentle toward humanity, Compassionate
Surely, We see the going to and fro of thy face toward heaven. Then, We will turn thee to a direction of formal prayer that thou wilt be well pleased with it. Then, turn thy face to the direction of the Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you had been, turn your faces to its direction. And, truly, those who were given the Book know that it is The Truth from their Lord, and God is not One Who is Heedless of what they do
And even if thou wert to bring to those who were given the Book every sign, they would not heed thy direction of formal prayer. Nor art thou one who heeds their direction of formal prayer. Nor are some of them ones who heed the direction of the other’s formal prayer. And if thou hadst followed their desires after the knowledge brought about to thee, then, truly, thou wouldst be among the ones who are unjust
Those to whom We gave the Book recognize it as they recognize their children, while, truly, a group of people among them keep back The Truth while they know
it is The Truth from thy Lord. So be thou not among the ones who contest
And everyone has a direction to that which he turns. Be forward, then, in good deeds. Wherever you be, God will bring you altogether for the Judgment. Truly, God is Powerful over everything
And from wherever thou hadst gone forth, then, turn thy face in the direction of the Masjid al-Haram. And, truly, this is The Truth from thy Lord, and God is not One Who is Heedless of what you do
And from wherever thou hadst gone forth, then, turn thy face to the direction of the Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you had been, then, turn your faces to the direction of it so that there be no disputation from humanity against you, but from those of them who did wrong. Dread them not, then, but dread Me. And I fulfill My divine blessing on you—so that perhaps you will be truly guided—
as We sent to you a Messenger from among you who recounts Our signs to you, and makes you pure, and teaches you the Book and wisdom, and teaches you what you be knowing not
So remember Me and I will remember you. And give thanks to Me, and be not ungrateful
O those who believed! Pray for help with patience and formal prayer. Truly, God is with the ones who remain steadfast
And say not about those who are slain in the way of God: They are lifeless. Nay! They are living, except you are not aware
We will, certainly, try you with something of fear and hunger and diminution of wealth and lives and fruits, and give good tidings to the ones who remain steadfast
those who, when an affliction lit on them, they said: Truly, we belong to God and, truly, we are ones who return to Him
Those, blessings will be sent on them from their Lord and mercy. And those, they are the ones who are truly guided
Truly, Safa and Marwa are among the Waymarks of God, so whoever made the pilgrimage to Makkah to the House or visited the Kabah, then, there is no blame on him that he circumambulates between the two. And whoever volunteered good, then, truly, God is One Who is Responsive, Knowing
Truly, those who keep back what We caused to descend of the clear portents and the guidance, after We made it manifest to humanity in the Book—those, God curses them and the ones who curse, curse them
But those who repented, and made things right, and made things manifest, then, those—I will turn to them in forgiveness. And I am The Accepter of Repentance, The Compassionate
Truly, those who were ungrateful, and they died and they were ones who are ungrateful, those, on them is a curse of God, and the angels and humanity, one and all
They are ones who will dwell in it forever. The punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be given respite
And your God is One God. There is no god but He, The Merciful, The Compassionate
Truly, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alteration of the nighttime and the daytime and the boats that run on the sea with what profits humanity, and what God caused to descend from heaven of water, and gave life to the earth after its death, and disseminated on it all moving creatures, and diversified the winds and the clouds, ones caused to be subservient between heaven and earth, are the signs for a folk who are reasonable
Yet there are among humanity some who take to themselves rivals besides God. They love them like they should cherish God. And those who believed are stauncher in cherishing God. And if only those who did wrong would consider when they will see the punishment that all strength belongs to God, and that God is Severe in punishment
When they will clear themselves—those who were followed from those who followed them—and they will see the punishment, all cords will be cut asunder from them
Those who were followed said: If there be a return again for us, then, we would clear ourselves from them as they cleared themselves from us. Thus, God will cause them to see their actions with regret for them, and they will never be ones who go forth from the fire
O humanity! Eat of what is in and on the earth—lawful, wholesome—and follow not the steps of the Satan. Truly, he is a clear enemy to you
Truly, he commands you to evil and depravity, and that you say about God what you know not
And when it was said to them: Follow what God caused to descend. They said: Nay! We will follow whatever we discovered our fathers were following on it —even though their fathers had been not at all reasonable—nor are they truly guided
And the parable of those who were ungrateful is like the parable of those who shout to what hears not, but a crying out and pleading yet those to which they call out to are deaf, dumb and blind, so they are not reasonable
O those who believed! Eat of what is good that We provided you and give thanks to God if it had been He alone whom you worship
Truly, He forbade carrion for you and blood and the flesh of swine and what was hallowed to any other than God, but whoever was driven by necessity, without being one who is willfully disobedient, and not one who turns away, then, it is not a sin for him. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Truly, those who keep back what God caused of the Book to descend, and exchange it for a little price, those, they consume not into their bellies but fire. God will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He make them pure. And for them will be a painful punishment

That is because God sent down the Book with The Truth and, truly, those who were at variance regarding the Book are in a wide breach
It is not virtuous conduct that you turn your faces towards the East or the West. Rather, virtuous conduct consists of: Whoever believed in God and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the Prophets. And whoever gave wealth out of cherishing Him to the possessors of kinship and to the orphans and to the needy and to the traveler of the way and to the one who begs and the freeing of a bondsperson, and whoever performed the formal prayer, and gave the purifying alms, and the ones who live up to their compact when they made a contract, and the ones who remain steadfast in desolation and tribulation and at the time of danger, those are those who were sincere and those, they are the ones who are Godfearing
O those who believed! Reciprocation was prescribed for you for the slain: the freeman for the freeman and the servant for the servant and the female for the female. But whoever was forgiven a thing by his brother, the pursuing be as one who is honorable, and the remuneration be with kindness. That is a lightening from your Lord, and a mercy. And he who exceeded the limits after that, then, for him is a painful punishment
And for you in reciprocation there is the saving of life, O those imbued with intuition, so that perhaps you will be Godfearing
It is prescribed for you when death attended anyone of you if one left goods, to bequeath to the ones who are your parents and the nearest kin as the one who is honorable, an obligation for the ones who are Godfearing

O those who believed! Formal fasting was prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those who were before you so that perhaps you will be Godfearing
Fasting is prescribed for numbered days. Then, whoever among you had been sick or on a journey, then, a period of other days. And for those who cannot fast is a redemption of food for the needy. And whoever volunteered good, it is better for him. And that you formally fast is better for you if you had been knowing
The month of Ramadan is that in which the Quran was caused to descend—a guidance for humanity—and clear portents of the guidance, and the Criterion between right and wrong. So whoever of you bore witness to the month, then, formal fasting, and whoever had been sick or on a journey, then, a period of other days. God wants ease for you, and wants not hardship for you, so that you perfect the period and that you magnify God because He guided you so that perhaps you will give thanks
And when My servants asked thee about Me, then, truly, I am near. I answer the call of one who calls when he will call to Me. So let them respond to Me and let them believe in Me, so that perhaps they will be on the right way
It is permitted for you on the nights of formal fasting to have sexual intercourse with your wives. They (f) are a garment for you and you are a garment for them (f). God knew that you had been dishonest to yourselves so He turned to you in forgiveness and pardoned you. So now lie with them (f) and look for what God prescribed for you. And eat and drink until the white thread becomes clear to you from the black thread at dawn. Again, fulfill the formal fasting until night.

Rather, virtuous conduct was to be Godfearing, and approach houses from their front doors. And be Godfearing of God so that perhaps you will prosper
And fight in the Way of God those who fight you, but exceed not the limits. Truly, God loves not the ones who exceed the limits
And kill them wherever you came upon them, and drive them out from wherever they drove you out. And persecution is more grave than killing. And fight them not near the Masjid al-Haram unless they fight you in it. But if they fought you, then kill them. Thus, this is the recompense for the ones who are ungrateful
Then, if they refrained themselves, then, truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
And fight them until there be no persecution, and the way of life be for God. Then, if they refrained themselves, then, there is to be no deep seated dislike, but against the ones who are unjust. Fight aggression

And spend in the way of God, and cast not yourselves by your own hands into deprivation by fighting. ^And do good^. Truly, God loves the ones who are doers of good
And fulfill the pilgrimage to Makkah, and the visit for God. And if you were restrained, then, whatever was feasible of sacrificial gifts.

And when you were safe, then, whoever took joy in the visit and the pilgrimage to Makkah then whatever was feasible of a sacrificial gift. Then, whoever finds not the means, then, formal fasting for three days during the pilgrimage to Makkah and seven when you returned, that is ten completely.

The pilgrimage to Makkah is in known months. And whoever undertook the duty of pilgrimage to Makkah in them, then, there is no sexual intercourse nor disobedience nor dispute during the pilgrimage to Makkah.

There is no blame on you that you be looking for grace from your Lord. And when you pressed on from Arafat, then remember God at the Sacred Monument. And remember Him as He guided you, although you had been before this, certainly, of the ones who go astray
Again, press on from where humanity pressed on, and ask God for forgiveness. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
And when you satisfied your devotional acts, then, remember God like your remembrance of your fathers, or a stauncher remembrance. And among humanity are some who say: Our Lord! Give to us in the present! And for him, there is no apportionment in the world to come
And among them are some who say: Our Lord! Give us benevolence in the present and benevolence in the world to come and protect us from the punishment of the fire
Those, for them is a share of what they earned. And God is Swift at reckoning
And remember God during numbered days. So whoever hastened on in two days, then, there is no sin on him. And whoever remained behind, then, there is no sin on him. And for whoever was Godfearing, be Godfearing of God. And know that to Him you will be assembled
And among humanity is one whose sayings impress thee about this present life and he calls to God to witness what is in his heart while he is most stubborn in altercation
And when he turned away, he hastened about the earth so that he makes corruption in and on it, and he causes the cultivation and stock to perish, but God loves not corruption
And when it was said to him: Be Godfearing of God! Vainglory took him to sin. So hell is enough for him! And, certainly, it will be a miserable Final Place

Ask the Children of Israel how many a sign, a clear portent, We gave them. And whoever substitutes the divine blessing of God after it drew near him, then, truly, God is Severe in repayment
Made to appear pleasing to those who were ungrateful I this present life, and they deride those who believed.• But those who were Godfearing will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. And God provides for whomever He wills without reckoning
Humanity had been of one community. Then, God raised up the Prophets, ones who give good tidings and ones who warn. And with them He caused the Book to descend with The Truth to give judgment among humanity about what they were at variance in it. None were at variance in it but those who were given it after the clear portents drew near them because of their insolence to one another. Then, God guided those who believed to The Truth—about what they were at variance in it— with His permission. And God guides whom He wills to a straight path
Or assumed you that you would enter the Garden while approaches you not the likeness of those who passed away before you? Desolation and tribulation afflicted them.

And they cease not to fight you until they repel you from your way of life, if they are able. And whoever of you goes back on his way of life, then, dies while he is one who is ungrateful, those, their actions were fruitless in the present and in the world to come. And those will be the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever

They ask thee about intoxicants and gambling. Say: In both of them there is deplorable sin and profits for humanity. And their sin is more deplorable than what is profitable. And they ask thee how much they should spend. Say: The extra. Thus, God makes manifest His signs to you so that perhaps you will reflect
on the present and the world to come. And they ask thee about orphans. Say: Making things right for them is better. And if you intermix with them, then they are your brothers/sisters. God knows the one who makes corruption from the one who makes things right. And if God willed, He would have overburdened you. Truly, God is Almighty, Wise
Marry not ones who are female polytheists until they believe. The one who is a believing, female bond servant is better than the one who is a female polytheist even if she impressed you and wed not the ones who are male polytheists until they believe. And one who is a believing, male bond servant is better than the one who is a male polytheist even if he impressed you. Those call you to the fire while God calls you to the Garden and to forgiveness with His permission. And He makes manifest His signs to humanity so that perhaps they will recollect
They ask thee about menstruation. Say: It is an impurity, so withdraw from your wives during menstruation. Come not near them (f) until they cleanse themselves.

For those who vow abstinence from their wives, await four months. Then, if they changed their minds, then, truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
And if they resolved on setting them (f) free, then, truly, God is Hearing, Knowing
And the women who are to be divorced will await by themselves three menstrual periods. And it is not lawful for them (f) that they (f) keep back what God created in their (f) wombs, if they (f) had been believing in God, and the Last Day. Their husbands have better right to come back during that period if they (m) wanted to make things right. For the rights of them (f) in regard to their husbands is the like of rights of their (f) husbands in regard to them (f), as one who is honorable. And men have a degree over them (f). And God is Almighty, Wise
Setting free is said two times: Then, hold fast to them (f) as one who is honorable or setting them (f) free with kindness. And it is not lawful for you that you take anything of what you gave them (f) unless they both fear that they both will not perform the ordinances of God. And if you feared that they both will not perform the ordinances of God, then, there is no blame on either of them in what she offered as redemption for that. These are the ordinances of God, so exceed not the limits. And whoever violates the ordinances of God, then, those, they are the ones who are unjust
And if he divorced her finally, then, she is not lawful to him after that until she marries a spouse other than him. Then, if that husband divorced her irrevocably, there is no blame on either of them if they return to one another if both of them thought that they will perform within the ordinances of God, and these are the ordinances of God. He makes them manifest for a folk who know
And when you divorced wives, and they (f) reached their (f) term, then, hold them (f) back as one who is honorable or set them (f) free as one who is honorable. But hold them (f) not back by injuring them so that you commit aggression. And whoever commits that, then, surely, he did wrong himself. And take not to yourselves the signs of God in mockery. Remember the divine blessing of God on you, and what He caused to descend to you from the Book and wisdom. He admonishes you with it. And be Godfearing of God and know that God is Knowing of everything
And when you revocably divorced wives, and they reached their (f) term, then, place not difficulties for them (f) that they (f) re-marry their former spouses when they agreed among themselves as one who is honorable. This is admonished for him —whoever had been among you who believes in God and the Last Day— that is pure and purer for you. And God knows and you know not
And the ones who are mothers will breast feed their (f) children for two years completely for whoever wanted to fulfill breast feeding. And on one to whom a child is born is their (f) provision and their clothing (f) as one who is honorable. No soul is placed with a burden, but to its capacity. Neither the one who is a mother be pressed for her child, nor the one to whom a child is born for his child. And on one who inherits is the like of that. While if they both wanted weaning by them agreeing together and after consultation, then, there is no blame on either of them. And if you wanted to seek wet-nursing for your children, then, there is no blame on you when you handed over what you gave as one who is honorable. And be Godfearing of God. And know that God is Seeing of what you do
And those of you whom death will call to itself, forsaking spouses, they (f) will await by themselves (f) four months and ten days. And when they (f) reached their term, then, there is no blame on you in what they (f) accomplished for themselves (f), as one who is honorable. God is Aware of what you do
And there is no blame on you in what you offered with it of a proposal to women, or for what you hid in yourselves. God knew that you will remember them (f), except appoint not with them (f) secretly, unless you say a saying as one who is honorable. And resolve not on the knot of marriage until she reaches her prescribed term. And know that God knows what is within yourselves. So be fearful of Him. And know that God is Forgiving, Forbearing
There is no blame on you if you divorced wives whom you touch not, nor undertake a duty to them (f) of a dowry portion. And make provision for them (f). For the one who is wealthy—according to his means—and for the one who is needy —according to his means—with a sustenance, one that is honorable, an obligation on the ones who are doers of good
And if you divorced them (f) before you touch them (f), and you undertook the duty of a dowry portion for them (f), then, half of what you undertook as a duty unless they (f) pardon it or they (m) pardon it in whose hand is the marriage knot. And that they (m) pardon is nearer to God-consciousness. Forget not grace among you. Truly, God is Seeing of what you do
Be watchful of the formal prayers and the middle formal prayer. Stand up as ones who are morally obligated to God
And if you feared, then, pray on foot or as one who is mounted. And when you were safe, then, remember God, for He taught you what you be not knowing
And those whom death will call to itself forsaking spouses, will bequeath for their spouses sustenance for a year without expelling them (f). But if they (f) went forth themselves (f), then, there is no blame on you in what they (f) accomplished for themselves (f) as one who is honorable. And God is Almighty, Wise
And for ones who are divorced females, sustenance, as one who is honorable. This is an obligation on the ones who are Godfearing
Thus, God makes manifest His signs to you so that perhaps you will be reasonable
Hast thou not considered those who went forth from their abodes while they were in the thousands being fearful of death? And God said to them: Die! Again, He gave them life. Truly, God is Possessor of Grace for humanity except most of humanity gives not thanks
So fight in the Way of God, and know that God is Hearing, Knowing
Who is he who will lend God a fairer loan that He will multiply it for him manifold times? And God seizes and extends and you are returned to Him
Hast thou not considered the Council of the Children of Israel after Moses when they said to a Prophet of theirs: Raise up a king for us, and we will fight in the way of God. He said: Perhaps if fighting was prescribed for you, you would not fight. They said: Why should we not fight in the way of God when we were driven out of our abodes with our children. Then, when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, but for a few of them. And God is Knowing of the ones who are unjust
And their Prophet said to them: Truly, God raised up for you Saul, a king. They said: How would it be for him to have dominion over us when we have better right to dominion than he, as he is not given plenty of wealth? He said: Truly, God favored him over you, and increased him greatly in the knowledge and the physique. And God gives His dominion to whom He wills. And God is One Who is Extensive, Knowing
And their Prophet said to them: Truly, a sign of his dominion is that there would approach you the Ark of the Covenant. In it is tranquility from your Lord, and abiding wisdom of what the people of Moses left, and the people of Aaron. And the angels will carry it. Truly, in that is a sign for you if you had been ones who believe
So when Saul set forward with his army he said: Truly, God is One Who Tests you with a river. So whoever would drink of it, he is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, truly, he is of me, but he who scoops up with a scooping of his hand. So they drank of it, but a few of them. Then, when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said: There is no energy for us today against Goliath and his armies. Said those who think they truly would be ones who encounter God: How often a faction of a few vanquished a faction of many with the permission of God! And God is with the ones who remain steadfast
And so when they departed against Goliath and his armies they said: Our Lord! Pour out patience on us, and make our feet firm, and help us against the folk— the ones who are ungrateful
So they put them to flight with the permission of God. And David killed Goliath. And God gave him the dominion and wisdom, and taught him of what He wills. And if not for God driving humanity back—some by some others—the earth would have, certainly, gone to ruin, except God is Possessor of Grace to the worlds
These are the signs of God. We recount to thee The Truth. And, truly, thou art among the ones who are sent
These are the Messengers. We gave advantage, some of them over some others.• Of them are those to whom God spoke and some of them He exalted in degree. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear portents and confirmed him with the hallowed Spirit. And if God willed, those who were after them have fought one another after the clear portents drew near them, except they were at variance. And some of them believed, while some of them were ones who are ungrateful. And if God willed, they would not have fought one another, except God accomplishes what He wants
O those who believed! Spend of what We provided you, before a Day approaches when there is neither trading in it nor friendship nor intercession. And the ones who are ungrateful, they are the ones who are unjust
God! There is no god but He, The Living, The Eternal. Neither slumber takes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. Who will intercede with Him but with His permission? He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them. And they will not comprehend anything of His knowledge, but what He willed. His Seat encompassed the heavens and the earth, and He is not hampered by their safe-keeping. And He is The Lofty, The Sublime
There is no compulsion in the way of life. Surely, right judgment became clear from error. So whoever disbelieves in false deities and believes in God, then, surely, he held fast to the most firm handhold. It is not breakable. And God is Hearing, Knowing
God is The Protector of those who believed. He brings them out from the shadows into the light. And those who were ungrateful, their protectors are false deities. They bring them out from the light into the shadows. Those will be the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever
Hast thou not considered him who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God gave him dominion? Mention when Abraham said: My Lord is He Who gives life and causes to die. He said: I give life and cause to die. Abraham said: Truly, God brings the sun from the East, so bring thou the sun from the West! Then, he who was ungrateful was dumfounded. And God guides not the unjust folk
Or like the one who passed by a town and it was one that has fallen down into ruins. He said: How will God give life to this after its death? So God caused him to die for a hundred years. Again, He raised him up. He said: How long hadst thou lingered in expectation? He said: I lingered in expectation for a day or some part of a day. He said: Nay. Thou hadst lingered in expectation a hundred years. Then look on thy food and thy drink. They are not spoiled. And look on thy donkey. We made thee a sign for humanity. And look on the bones, how We set them up. Again, We will clothe them with flesh. So when it became clear to him, he said: I know that God is Powerful over everything
And mention when Abraham said: My Lord! Cause me to see how Thou wilt give life to the dead. He said: Wilt thou not believe? He said: Yea, but so my heart be at rest. He said: Again, take four birds, and twist them to thyself. Again, lay a part of them on every mountain. Again, call to them. They will approach thee coming eagerly. And know thou that God is Almighty, Wise
A parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of God is like a parable of a grain. It puts forth seven ears of wheat. In every ear of wheat, a hundred grains. And God multiplies for whom He wills. And God is One Who is Extensive, Knowing
Those who spend their wealth in the way of God and, again, pursue not what they spent with reproachful reminders nor injury, the compensation for them is with their Lord. And there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse
An honorable saying and forgiveness are better than charity succeeded by injury. And God is Sufficient, Forbearing
O those who believed! Render not untrue your charities with reproachful reminders nor injury like he who spends of his wealth to show off to humanity, and believes not in God and the Last Day. His parable is like the parable of a smooth rock. Over it is earth dust. A heavy downpour lit on it, and left it bare. They have no power over anything of what they earned and God guides not the ungrateful folk
And the parable of those who spend their wealth looking for the goodwill of God and for confirming their souls is like the parable of a garden on a hillside. A heavy downpour lit on it. Then, it gave its harvest double. And even if lights not on it a heavy downpour, then a dew. And God is Seeing of what you do
Would anyone of you wish that he have a garden of date palm trees and grapevines beneath which rivers run with all kinds of fruits in it for him? Then, old age lit on him, and he had weak offspring. Then, a whirlwind lit on it in which there is a fire. Then, it was consumed. Thus, God makes manifest His signs for you so that perhaps you will reflect
O those who believed! Spend of what is good that you earned, and from what We brought out for you from the earth. And aim not at getting the bad of it to spend while you would not be ones who take it, but you would close an eye to it. And know that God is Sufficient, Worthy of Praise
Satan threatens you with poverty and commands you to depravity; whereas God promises you His forgiveness from Himself and His grace. And God is One Who is Extensive, Knowing
He gives wisdom to whom He wills. And whomever is given wisdom, then, surely, was given much good and none recollects no doubt but those imbued with intuition
And whatever of contributions you spent or vows that you vowed, then, truly, God knows it. And for the ones who are unjust there is no helper
If you show your charity, then, how bountiful it is while if you conceal it and give it to the poor, that would be better for you. This absolves you of some of your evil deeds. And God is Aware of what you do
Their guidance is not on thee. But God guides whomever He wills. And whatever of good you spend, it is for yourselves. And spend not but looking for the Countenance of God. And whatever of good you spend, your account will be paid to you in full and you will not be wronged
Spend for the poor, those who were restrained in the way of God and are not able to travel on the earth. The one who is ignorant assumes them to be rich because of their having reserve. Thou wilt recognize them by their mark. They ask not persistently of humanity. And whatever of good you spend, then, truly, God is Knowing of that
Those who spend their wealth by nighttime and daytime, secretly or in public, then, for them, their compensation is with their Lord. And there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse
Those who consume usury will not arise, but like he who arises whom Satan prostrated by touch. That is because they said: Trading is only like usury and yet God permitted trading and forbade usury. So whoever drew near an admonishment from his Lord and refrained himself, for him is what was past. And his command is with God. While whoever reverted, then, those will be the Companions of the Fire. They, ones who will dwell in it forever
God eliminates usury, and He causes charity to increase. And God loves not any sinful ingrate
Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and performed the formal prayer and gave the purifying alms, for them, their compensation is with their Lord. And there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse
O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God. And forsake what remained of usury, if you had been ones who believe
But if you accomplish it not, then, give ear to war from God and His Messenger. And if you repented, you will have your principal capital, doing no wrong to others nor will you be wronged
If a debtor had been possessing adversity, a respite until a time of ease and prosperity. And it is better for you that you be charitable, if you had been knowing
And be Godfearing of a Day on which you are returned to God. Again, every soul will be paid its account in full for what it earned, and they will not be wronged
O those who believed! When you contracted a debt for a term—that which is determined—then, write it down. Let one who is a scribe write it down between you justly. One who is a scribe should not refuse to write it down as God taught him. So let him write down and let the debtor dictate. Let him be Godfearing of God, his Lord, and diminish not anything out of it. But if the debtor had been mentally deficient, or weak, or not able to dictate himself, then, let his protector dictate justly. And call two witnesses to bear witness from among your men. Or if there are not two men, then a man and two women, with whom you are well-pleased as witnesses, so that if one of them (f) goes astray, then, the other one of the two will remind her. And the witnesses will not refuse when they were called. And grow not weary that you write it down, be it small or great, with its term. That is more equitable with God and more upright for testimony, and likelier not to be in doubt unless it be a trade, that which is transferred at the time—to give and take among yourselves. Then, there is no blame on you if you not write it down. And call witnesses when you have a transaction. Let neither one who is a scribe nor witness be pressed. And if you accomplish that, then, it is, truly, disobedience on your part. So be Godfearing of God. And God teaches you. And God is Knowing of everything
And if you had been on a journey and find no one who is a scribe, then, a guarantee of that which is held in hand. But if any of you entrusted to another, then, let who was trusted give back his trust and let him be Godfearing of God, his Lord, and keep not back testimony. And he who keeps back, he, then, truly, his heart is one that is perverted. And God is Knowing of what you do
To God belongs what is in the heavens and in and on the earth. Whether you show what is within yourselves, or conceal it, God will make a reckoning with you for it. And He will forgive whom He wills. And He will punish whom He wills. And God is Powerful over everything
The Messenger believed in what was caused to descend to him from his Lord as do the ones who believe. All believed in God and His angels and His Books and His Messengers saying: We separate and divide not among anyone of His Messengers. And they said: We heard and we obeyed, so grant Thy forgiveness, Our Lord! And to Thee is the Homecoming
God places not a burden on a soul beyond its capacity. For it is what it earned and against it is what it deserved. Our Lord! Take us not to task if we forgot or made a mistake. Our Lord! Burden us not with a severe test like that which Thou hadst burdened those who were before us. Our Lord! Load us not such that we have no energy for it and pardon us and forgive us and have mercy on us. Thou art our Defender so help us against the folk, the ones who are ungrateful
Alif L[m M\m]
God! There is no god but He, The Living, The Eternal
He sent down to thee the Book with The Truth, that which establishes as true what was before it. And He caused to descend the Torah and the Gospel
before this as a guidance for humanity. And He caused to descend the Criterion between right and wrong. Truly, those who were ungrateful for the signs of God, for them is a severe punishment. And God is Almighty, Possessor of Requital
Truly, God, nothing is hidden from Him in or on the earth nor in heaven
It is He Who forms you in the wombs how He wills. There is no god but He, Almighty, Wise
It is He who caused the Book to descend to thee. In it are signs, ones that are definitive. They are the essence of the Book and others, ones that are unspecific. Then, those whose hearts are swerving, they follow what was unspecific in it, looking for dissent and looking for an interpretation, but none knows its interpretation but God. And the ones who are firmly rooted in knowledge say: We believed in it as all is from our Lord. And none recollects, but those imbued with intuition
Our Lord! Cause our hearts not to swerve after Thou hadst guided us. And bestow on us mercy from that which proceeds from Thy Presence. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Giver
Our Lord! Truly, Thou art One Who Gathers humanity on a Day in which there is no doubt in it. Truly, God breaks not His solemn declaration
Truly, those who were ungrateful, it will not avail them—neither their wealth nor their children—against God at all. And those, they will be fuel for the fire
in like manner of the people of Pharaoh and those who were before them. They denied Our signs so God took them because of their impiety. And God is Severe in repayment
Say to those who were ungrateful: You will be vanquished and you will be assembled into hell. It will be a miserable Final Place
Surely, there had been a sign for you in the two factions who met one another—one faction fights in the way of God and the other as ones who are ungrateful, whom they see twice the like of visibly in their eyes. And God confirms with His help whom He wills. Truly, in this is a lesson for those imbued with insight
Made to appear pleasing to humanity was the cherishing of lust: From women and children and that which is heaped up heaps of gold and silver and horses, ones that are distinguished, and flocks and cultivation, that is the enjoyment of this present life, while God, with Him is the goodness of the Destination
Say: Shall I tell you of better than that? For those who were Godfearing, with their Lord are Gardens beneath which rivers run. They are ones who will dwell in them forever with purified spouses and contentment from God. And God is Seeing His servants
those who say: Our Lord! Truly, we believed, so forgive us our impieties and protect us from the punishment of the fire
They are the ones who remain steadfast and the ones who are sincere and the ones who are morally obligated and the ones who spend in the way of God and the ones who ask for forgiveness at the breaking of day
God bore witness that there is no god but He, as do the angels and those imbued with the knowledge, the ones who uphold equity. There is no god but He, The Almighty, The Wise
Truly the way of life with God is submission to the One God. And at variance were those who were given the Book after what drew near them of the knowledge out of insolence among themselves. And whoever is ungrateful for the signs of God, then, truly, God is Swift in reckoning
So if they argued with thee, then say: I submitted my face to God as have those who followed me. And say to those who were given the Book and to the unlettered: Have you submitted to God? If they submitted to God, then, surely, they were truly guided. And if they turned away, then, on thee is only delivering the message. And God is Seeing of His servants
Truly, those who are ungrateful for the signs of God and kill the Prophets without right and kill those who command to equity from among humanity, then, give thou to them the good tidings of a painful punishment
Those, those are they whose actions were fruitless in the present and the world to come. And for them there is no one who helps
Hast thou not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They are called to the Book of God to give judgment between them. Again, a group of people among them turn away and they, they are ones who turn aside
That is because they said: The fire will not touch us but for numbered days. And they were deluded in their way of life by what they had been devising
How then will it be when We gathered them on a Day, there is no doubt in it? The account of every soul will be paid in full for what it earned and they, they will not be wronged
Say: O God! The One Who is Sovereign of Dominion, Thou hast given dominion to whom Thou hast willed, and Thou hast torn away dominion from whom Thou hast willed. Thou hast rendered powerful whom Thou hast willed, and Thou hast abased whom Thou hast willed. In Thy hand is the good. Truly, Thou art Powerful over everything
Thou hast caused the nighttime to be interposed into the daytime. And Thou hast caused the daytime to be interposed into the nighttime. And Thou hast brought out the living from the dead. And Thou hast brought out the dead from the living. Thou hast provided to whomever Thou hast willed without stinting
Let not the ones who believe take to themselves the ones who are ungrateful for protectors instead of the ones who believe. And whoever accomplishes that is not with God in anything, unless it is because you are Godfearing that you are being cautious towards them. And God cautions you of Himself. And to God is the Homecoming
Say: Whether you conceal what is in your breasts or show it, God knows it and He knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. And God is Powerful over everything
A Day when every soul will find that which is brought forward of good and what it did of evil. It will wish that there be between this and between that a long space of time. God cautions you of Himself. And God is Gentle to the servants
Say: If you had been loving God, then, follow me. And God will love you and forgive you your impieties. God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Say: Obey God and the Messenger. Then, if they turned away, then, truly, God loves not the ones who are ungrateful
Truly, God favored Adam and Noah and the people of Abraham and the people of Imran above all the worlds
some of one another’s offspring. And God is The Hearing, The Knowing
Mention when the woman of Imran said: My Lord! I vowed to Thee what is in my womb—that which is dedicated—so receive Thou this from me. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Hearing, The Knowing
Then, when she brought forth she said: My Lord! Truly, I brought her forth, a female. And God is greater in knowledge of what she brought forth. And the male is not like the female. And, truly, I named her Mary. And, truly, I commend her to Thy protection and her offspring from the accursed Satan
So her Lord received her with the very best acceptance. And her bringing forth caused the very best to develop in her. And Zechariah took charge of her. Whenever Zechariah entered upon her in her sanctuary, he found her with provision. He said: O Mary! From where is this for thee (f)? She said: This is from God. Truly, God provides to whom He wills without reckoning
There Zechariah called to his Lord. He said: My Lord! Bestow on me good offspring from Thy Presence. Truly, Thou art hearing the supplication
Then, the angels proclaimed to him while he was one who stands to invoke blessings in the sanctuary that God gives thee good tidings of Yahya—one who establishes the Word of God as true—a chief and concealer of secrets and a Prophet among the ones in accord with morality
He said: My Lord! How is it I will have a boy while, surely, I reached old age and my woman is a barren woman. He said: Thus, God accomplishes what He wills
He said: My Lord! Assign a sign for me. He said: Thy sign is that thou wilt not speak to humanity for three days but by gesture and remember thy Lord frequently, and glorify in the evening and early morning
And mention when the angels said: O Mary! Truly, God favored thee (f), and purified thee (f), and favored thee (f) above women of the world
O Mary! Be thou morally obligated to thy Lord and prostrate thyself (f) and bow down (f) with the ones who bow down
That is tidings from the unseen We reveal to thee. And thou hadst not been present with them when they cast their pens as to which of them would take control of Mary, nor hadst thou been present with them when they strive against one another
Mention when the angels said: O Mary! Truly, God gives thee (f) good tidings of a Word from Him. His name is the Messiah—Jesus son of Mary—well-esteemed in the present and the world to come and among the ones who are brought near
And he will speak to humanity from the cradle and in manhood and be among the ones in accord with morality
She said: My Lord! How is it I will be with child when no mortal touches me? He said: Thus, God creates whatever He wills. When He decreed a command, then, He only says to it: Be! Then, it is
And He teaches him the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel
to be a Messenger to the Children of Israel saying: Surely I drew near you with a sign from your Lord that I will create for you out of clay a likeness of a bird. Then, I breathe into it and it will become a bird with the permission of God. And I cure one who is blind from birth and the leper and give life to dead mortals with the permission of God. And I tell you what you eat and what you store up in your houses. Truly, in that is a sign for you if you had been ones who believe
And I come with that which establishes as true what was before me of the Torah, and permit you some of what was forbidden to you. And I drew near you with a sign from your Lord. So be Godfearing of God and obey Me
Truly, God is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him. This is a straight path
And when Jesus became conscious of their ingratitude, he said: Who are my helpers for God? The disciples said: We will be helpers for God. We believed in God and bear thee witness that we are ones who submit to God
Our Lord! We believed in what Thou hadst caused to descend. And we followed the Messenger so write us down with the ones who bear witness
And they planned and God planned. And God is Best of the ones who plan
Mention when God said: O Jesus! I will be One Who Gathers thee and One Who Elevates thee to Myself and One Who Purifies thee from those who were ungrateful, and One Who Makes those who followed thee above those who were ungrateful until the Day of Resurrection. Again, you will return to Me. Then, I will give judgment between you about what you had been at variance in it
So as for those who were ungrateful, then, I will punish them with a severe punishment in the present and the world to come. And for them there is no one who helps
And to those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, We will pay them their account with full compensation. And God loves not the ones who are unjust
These We recount to thee are of the signs and the wise remembrance
Truly the parable of Jesus with God is like the parable of Adam. He created him from earth dust. Again, He said to him: Be! Then, he is
The Truth is from thy Lord, so be not of the ones who contest
Then, to whoever argued with thee about it after what drew near thee of the knowledge, say: Approach now! Let us call to our children and your children and our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves. Again we will humbly supplicate, and we lay the curse of God on the ones who lie
This is, truly, a narrative of The Truth. And there is no god but God. And, truly, God, He is The Almighty, The Wise
Then, truly, if they turned away, then, truly, God is Knowing of the ones who make corruption
Say: O People of the Book! Approach now to a word common between us and between you that we worship none but God and ascribe nothing as partners with Him, that none of us take others to ourselves as lords besides God. And if they turned away, then, say: Bear witness that we are ones who submit to God
O People of the Book! Why argue with one another about Abraham while neither was the Torah caused to descend nor the Gospel until after him. Will you not, then, be reasonable
Lo, behold! You are these who argued with one another about what you have some knowledge. Why, then, argue with one another about what is with you when you have no knowledge? And God knows and you know not
Abraham had been neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he had been a monotheist, one who submits to God. He had not been among the ones who were polytheists
Truly, of humanity closest to Abraham are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believed. And God is Protector of the ones who believe
A section of the People of the Book wished that they cause you to go astray. And they cause none to go astray, but themselves, and they are not aware
O People of the Book! Why be ungrateful for the signs of God while you bear witness
O People of the Book! Why confuse you The Truth with falsehood, and keep back The Truth while you know
And a section of the People of the Book said: Believe in what was caused to descend to those who believed at the beginning of the daytime. Disbelieve at the last of the day so that perhaps they will return to disbelief
And believe none, but one who heeded your way of life. Say: Truly guidance is The Guidance from God and believe not that anyone be given the like of what you were given, so that he argue with you before your Lord. Say: Truly, the grace is in the hand of God. He gives it to whomever He wills. And God is One Who is Extensive, Knowing
He singles out for His mercy whom He wills. And God is Possessor of Sublime Grace
And among the People of the Book is he who, if thou hast entrusted him with a hundredweight, he would give it back to thee. And among them is he who, if thou hast entrusted him with a dinar, he would not give it back to thee unless thou hadst continued as one who stands over him. That is because they said: There is no way of moral duty on us as to the unlettered. And they are lying against God while they, they know
Yea! Whoever lived up to his compact and was Godfearing, then, truly, God loves the ones who are Godfearing
Truly, those who exchange the compact of God and their sworn oaths for a little price, those, there is no apportionment for them in the world to come. And God will neither speak to them, nor look on them on the Day of Resurrection nor will He make them pure. And for them is a painful punishment
And, truly, among them is a group of people who distort their tongues with the Book so that you assume it is from the Book, although it is not from the Book. And they say: It is from God, although it is not from God. And they say a lie against God while they know
It had not been for a mortal that God should give him the Book and critical judgment and the prophethood and, again, he say to humanity: Be you servants of me instead of God! Rather, he would say: Be you masters, because you had been teaching the Book and because you had been studying it
Nor would He command you to take to yourselves the angels and the Prophets as lords. Would He command you to ingratitude after you are ones who submit to God
And mention when God took a solemn promise from the Prophets: Whatever I gave you of the Book and wisdom, again, if a Messenger drew near you with that which establishes as true what is with you, you will believe in him and you will help him. He said: Are you in accord? And will you take on My severe test? They said: We are in accord. He said: Then, bear witness and I am with you among the ones who bear witness
Then, whoever turned away after this, then, those, they are the ones who disobey
Desire they other than the way of life of God while to Him submitted whatever is in the heavens and the earth willingly or unwillingly and they are returned to Him
Say: We believed in God and what was caused to descend to us and what was caused to descend to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes and what was given to Moses and Jesus and the Prophets from their Lord. We separate and divide not between anyone of them and we are ones who submit to Him
And whoever be looking for a way of life other than submission to God, it will never be accepted from him. And he, in the world to come, will be among the ones who are losers
How will God guide a folk who disbelieved after their belief? And they bore witness to The Truth of the Messenger after the clear portents drew near them. And God guides not the unjust folk
Those, their recompense is that the curse of God is on them and of the angels and of humanity, one and all
ones who will dwell with it forever. Neither will the punishment be lightened from them, nor will they be given respite
But those who repented after that and made things right, then, truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Truly, those who disbelieved after their belief, again, added to their disbelief. Their remorse will never be accepted. Those, they are the ones who go astray
Truly, those who were ungrateful and died when they were ones who are ungrateful, it will not be accepted from anyone of them the earth full of gold, even if he offered it as ransom. Those, for them, is a painful punishment, and for them there is no one who helps
You will never attain virtuous conduct until you spend of what you love. And whatever thing you spend, truly, God is Knowing of it
All food had been allowed to the Children of Israel, but what Israel, Jacob, forbade to himself before the Torah is sent down. Say: Then, approach with the Torah and recount it if you had been ones who are sincere
Then, whoever devised lies against God after that then, those, they are the ones who are unjust
Say: God was Sincere, so follow the creed of Abraham—a monotheist—and he had not been among the ones who are polytheists
Truly, the first House set in place for humanity was that which is at Bekka, that which is blessed, and a guidance for the worlds
In it are clear portents, signs, the Station of Abraham. And whoever entered it had been one who is safe. And to God is a duty on humanity of pilgrimage to the House in Makkah for whoever was able to travel the way to it. And whoever was ungrateful, then truly God is Independent of the worlds
Say: O People of the Book! Why be ungrateful for the signs of God? And God is Witness over what you do
Say: O People of the Book! Why bar you from the way of God he who believed, desiring crookedness when you are witnesses? God is not One Who is Heedless of what you do
O those who believed! If you obey a group of people of those who were given the Book, they will repel you after your belief turning you into ones who are ungrateful
And how would you be ungrateful when the signs of God are recounted to you, and His Messenger is among you? And whoever cleaves firmly to God was, then, surely guided to a straight path
O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God as it is His right that He be feared. And die not but that you be ones who submit to the One God
And cleave firmly to the rope of God altogether and be not split up. And remember the divine blessing of God on you when you had been enemies. Then, He brought your hearts together. You became brothers/sisters by His divine blessing. You had been on the brink of an abyss of the fire and He saved you from it. Thus, God makes manifest to you His signs so that perhaps you will be truly guided
And let there be a community from among you who calls to good and commands to that which is honorable and prohibits that which is unlawful. And those, they are the ones who prosper
And be not like those who split up and were at variance after the clear portents drew near them. And those, for them is a tremendous punishment
on a Day when faces will brighten and faces will cloud over. As for those whose faces cloud over: Disbelieve you after your belief? Then experience the punishment for what you had been ungrateful
And as for those whose faces brightened, they are in the mercy of God. They, ones who will dwell in it forever
These are the signs of God. We recount them to thee in Truth. And God wants not injustice in the worlds
And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. To God all commands are returned
You had been the best community that was brought out for humanity. You command to that which is honorable and prohibit that which is unlawful and believe in God. And if the People of the Book believed, it would have been better for them. Some of them are the ones who believe, but most of them are the ones who disobey
They will never injure you but are an annoyance. And if they fight you, they will turn their backs on you. Again, they will not be helped
Abasement was stamped on them wherever they were come upon—but those with a rope to God and a rope to humanity—and they drew the burden of anger from God and wretchedness was stamped on them. That is because they had been ungrateful for the signs of God and kill the Prophets without right. That is because they rebelled and had been exceeding the limits
They are not all the same. Among the People of the Book is a community of ones who are upstanding. They recount the signs of God in the night watch of the night and they, they prostrate themselves
They believe in God and the Last Day and they command that which is honorable and prohibit that which is unlawful and they compete with one another in good deeds. Those are among the ones in accord with morality
And whatever of good they accomplish will never go unappreciated. And God is Knowing of the ones who are Godfearing
Truly, those who were ungrateful never will avail them their wealth nor their children against God at all. And those will be the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever
The parable of what they spend in this present life is like the parable of a freezing wind in it that lit on the cultivation of the folk who did wrong themselves and caused it to perish. And God did not wrong them, but they do wrong themselves
O those who believed! Take not to yourselves as close friends other than yourselves. They stop at nothing to ruin you. They wished that misfortune would fall on you. Surely, their hatred showed itself from their mouths and what their breasts conceal is greater. Surely, We made manifest to you the signs if you had been reasonable
Lo, behold! You are those imbued with love for them, but they love you not. And you believed in the Book, all of it. And when they met you, they said: We believe. But when they went privately, they bit the tips of their fingers at you in rage. Say: Die in your rage. Truly God is Knowing of what is within the breasts
If benevolence touches you, it raises anger in them, but if an evil deed lights on you, they are glad about it. But if you endure patiently and are Godfearing, their cunning will not injure you at all. Truly, God is One Who Encloses what they do
And when thou hadst set forth in the early morning from thy family to place the ones who believe at their positions for fighting, God is Hearing, Knowing
Mention when two sections are about to lose heart among you although God was their Protector. And let the ones who believe put their trust in God
And, certainly, God helped you at Badr while you were humiliated in spirit. So be Godfearing of God so that perhaps you will give thanks
Mention when thou hast said to the ones who believe: Suffices you not that your Lord will reinforce you with three thousand among the angels? Ones who are caused to descend
yea! if you endure patiently and are Godfearing? And if they approach you instantly here, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels—ones who are sweeping on
And God made it but as good tidings to you so that with it your hearts will be at rest. And there is no help, but from God, The Almighty, The Wise
for He will sever a selection of those who were ungrateful or suppress them so they turn about as ones who are frustrated
It is none of thy affair at all if He turns to them in forgiveness or He punishes them, for, truly, they are ones who are unjust
And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
O those who believed! Consume not usury—that which is doubled and redoubled—and be Godfearing of God so that perhaps you will prosper
And be Godfearing of the fire that was prepared for the ones who are ungrateful
And obey God and the Messenger so that perhaps you will find mercy
And compete with one another for forgiveness from your Lord and for a Garden whose depth is as the heavens and the earth that was prepared for the ones who are Godfearing
those who spend in gladness and tribulation and the ones who choke their rage and the ones who pardon humanity. And God loves the ones who are doers of good
And those who, when they committed an indecency or did wrong to themselves, they remembered God. Then, they asked for forgiveness for their impieties. And who forgives impieties but God? And persist not in what impiety they committed while they know
Those, their recompense is forgiveness from their Lord and Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever. And how bountiful is the compensation for the ones who work
Customs passed away before you. So journey through the earth; then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who deny
This is a clear explanation for humanity, a guidance and an admonishment for the ones who are Godfearing
And be not feeble nor feel remorse. And you will be among the lofty, if you had been ones who believe
If a wound afflicts you, surely, a wound afflicted the folk similar to that. And these are the days We rotate among humanity so that God knows those who believed and takes witnesses to Himself from among you—and God loves not the ones who are unjust—
and so that God may prove those who believed and eliminate the ones who are ungrateful
Or assumed you that you would enter the Garden while God knows not those who struggled among you and knows the ones who remain steadfast
And, certainly, you had been coveting death before you were to meet it. Then, surely, you saw and look on it
And Muhammad is only a Messenger. Surely, Messengers passed away before him. Then, if he died or be slain, will you turn about on your heels? And he who turns about on his heels will not injure God at all. And God will give recompense to the ones who are thankful
It had not been for any soul to die, but with the permission of God. Prescribed is that which is appointed. And whoever wants a reward for good deeds in the present, We will give him that. And whoever wants a reward for good deeds in the world to come We will give him that. And We will give recompense to the ones who are thankful
And how many a Prophet whom, along with him, many thousands fought, but none lost confidence with what lit on them in the way of God, nor were they weakened nor were they to give in. And God loves the ones who remain steadfast
And their saying had been only that they said: Our Lord! Forgive us our impieties and our excessiveness in our affairs. And make our feet firm and help us against the folk, the ones who are ungrateful
So God gave them a reward for good deeds in the present and the goodness of reward for good deeds in the world to come. And God loves the ones who are doers of good
O those who believed! If you obey those who were ungrateful, they will repel you back on your heels and you will turn about—ones who are losers
Nay! God is your Defender and He is Best of the ones who help
We will cast into the hearts of those who were ungrateful, alarm, because they ascribed partners with God. And He sends not down for it authority. And their place of shelter will be the fire. And miserable will be the place of lodging of the ones who are unjust
And, certainly, God was sincere to you in His promise when you blasted the enemy with His permission until you lost heart and you contended with one another about the command and you rebelled after He caused you to see what you longed for in the spoils of war. Among you are some who want the present and among you are some who want the world to come. Again, He turned you away from them that He test you and, certainly, He pardoned you. And God is Possessor of Grace for the ones who believe
When you mount up, not attentive to anyone and the Messenger calls you from your rear, then, He repaid you, lament for lament, so that you neither feel remorse for what slipped away from you, nor for what lit on you. And God is Aware of what you do
Again, He caused to descend safety for you after lament. Sleepiness overcomes a section of you while a section caused themselves grief thinking of God without right, a thought out of the Age of Ignorance. They say: Have we any part in the command? Say: Truly, the command is entirely from God. They conceal within themselves what they show not to thee. They say: If there had been for us any part in the command, we would not be killed here. Say: Even if you had been in your houses, those would have departed—whom it was prescribed they be slain—for the Final Place of sleeping, so that God tests what is in your breasts and He proves what is in your hearts. And God is Knowing of what is in the breasts
Truly, those of you who turned away on a day two multitudes met one another, only Satan caused them to slip back for some of what they earned. And, certainly, God pardoned them. Truly God is Forgiving, Forbearing
O those who believed! Be not like those who were ungrateful and said about their brothers when they traveled through the earth or had been ones who are combatants: If they had been with us, neither would they have died, nor would they have been slain, so that God makes this a cause of regret in their hearts. And God gives life and causes to die. And God is Seeing of what you do
And if you were slain in the way of God or died, certainly, forgiveness and mercy from God are better than what they gather in the present
And if you died or were slain, it is, certainly, to God you will be assembled
And it is by the mercy of God thou wert gentle with them. And if thou hadst been hard, harsh of heart, they would have broken away from around thee. So pardon them and ask for forgiveness for them. And take counsel with them in the affair. But when thou art resolved, then, put thy trust in God. Truly, God loves the ones who put their trust in Him
If God helps you, then none will be one who is a victor over you. And if He withdraws His help from you, then, who is there who helps you after Him? And in God put their trust the ones who believe
It had not been for a Prophet that he defraud. And whoever defrauds, what he defrauded will approach him on the Day of Resurrection. Again, the account will be paid in full of every soul for what he earned and they will not be wronged
So, then, is he who followed the contentment of God like he who drew the burden of the displeasure of God and whose place of shelter will be hell? And miserable will be the Homecoming
They have degrees with God. And God is Seeing of what they do
Certainly, God showed grace to the ones who believe when he raised up among them a Messenger from themselves who recounts His signs to them and makes them pure and teaches them the Book and wisdom. And, truly, before that they had been, certainly, clearly wandering astray
And why, when an affliction lit on you, surely, you lit two times its like on them. Say: Where is this from? Say: It is from yourselves. Truly, God is Powerful over everything
And what lit on you on a day when the two multitudes met one another was with the permission of God that He would know the ones who believe
and He would know those who were hypocrites. It was said to them: Approach now! Fight in the way of God or drive back. They said: If we would have known there would be fighting, we would, certainly, have followed you. They were nearer to disbelief on that day than to belief. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. And God is greater in knowledge of what they keep back
Those who said to their brothers while they sat back: If they obeyed us, they would not have been slain. Say: Then, drive off death from yourselves, if you had been ones who are sincere
And assume not those who were slain in the way of God to be lifeless. Nay! They are living with their Lord. They are provided for
glad for what God gave them of His grace. And rejoice at the good tidings for those who have not yet joined them from behind them. There will be neither fear in them, nor will they feel remorse
They rejoice at the good tidings of the divine blessing from God and His grace and that God will not waste the compensation of the ones who believe
those who responded to God and the Messenger after wounds lit on them. For those of them who did good among them and were Godfearing, there is a sublime compensation
Those to whom humanity said: Truly, humanity has gathered against you, so dread them, but it increased them in belief and they said: God is enough for us. And how excellent is He, The Trustee
So they turned about with divine blessing from God and grace and evil afflicts them not and they followed the contentment of God and God is Possessor of Sublime Grace
It is only Satan who frightens you with his protectors. So fear them not, but fear Me if you had been ones who believe
And let not those who compete with one another in ingratitude dishearten thee. Truly, they will never injure God at all. God wants to assign no allotment for them in the world to come and for them is a tremendous punishment
Truly, those who bought ingratitude at the price of belief will never injure God at all. And for them will be a painful punishment
And those who were ungrateful should not assume that the indulgence We grant to them is better for them. We only grant indulgence to them so that they add sin! And for them is a despised punishment
God had not been forsaking the ones who believe to what you are in until He differentiates the bad from what is good. And God will not inform about the unseen, but God elects from His Messengers whom He wills. So believe in God and His Messengers. And if you believe and are Godfearing, then, for you there is a sublime compensation
And assume not those who are misers that what God gave them of His grace is better for them. Nay! It is worse for them. To be hung around their necks will be what they were misers with on the Day of Resurrection. And to God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth. And God is Aware of what you do
Certainly, God heard the saying of those who said: Truly, God is poor and we are rich.• We will write down what they said and their killing of the Prophets without right. And We will say: Experience the punishment of the burning
That is for what your hands put forward and that God is not unjust to His servants
To those who said: Truly, God made a compact with us that we believe not in a Messenger until He approaches with a sacrifice to be consumed by the fire, say: Surely, Messengers brought about to you before me the clear portents and even of what you spoke. Then, why have you killed them if you had been ones who are sincere
Then if they denied thee, surely, Messengers before thee were denied who drew near with the clear portents and the Psalms and the illuminating Book
Every soul is one that experiences death. Your account will be paid with full compensation on the Day of Resurrection. Then, whoever was drawn away from the fire and was caused to enter the Garden, surely, won a triumph. And what is this present life but the delusion of enjoyment
You will, certainly, be tried with your wealth and yourselves and you will, certainly, hear much annoyance from those who were given the Book before you and from those who ascribed partners with God. And if you endure patiently and are Godfearing, then, truly, that is of the commands to constancy
And when God took a solemn promise from those who were given the Book: You will make it manifest to humanity and keep it not back. Yet they repudiated it behind their backs and exchange it for a little price. And miserable will be what they buy
Assume not that those who are glad for what they brought and who love to be praised for what they accomplish not, assume not, then, that they will be kept safe from the punishment. And for them, a painful punishment
To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and of the earth. And God is Powerful over everything
Truly, in the creation of the heavens and of the earth and the alteration of nighttime and daytime there are signs for those imbued with intuition
those who remember God while upright and sitting and on their sides and they reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth: Our Lord! Thou hadst not created this in vain. Glory be to Thee! Then, protect us from the punishment of the fire
Our Lord! Whomever Thou hast caused to enter the fire, surely, Thou hadst covered him with shame and there will not be for the ones who are unjust any helpers
Our Lord! Truly, we heard one who calls out, cries out for belief: Believe in your Lord! So we believed. Our Lord! So forgive Thou our impieties and absolve us of our evil deeds and gather us to Thee with the pious
Our Lord! Give us what Thou hadst promised us through Thy Messengers and cover us not with shame on the Day of Resurrection. Truly, Thou wilt not break Thy solemn declaration
And their Lord responded to them: I waste not the actions of ones who work among you from male or female. Each one of you is from the other. So those who emigrated and were driven out from their abodes and were maligned on My way and who fought and were slain, I will, certainly, absolve them of their evil deeds. And I will, certainly, cause them to enter into Gardens beneath which rivers run, a reward for good deeds from God. And God, with Him is the goodness of rewards for good deeds
Let not the going to and fro delude thee of those who were ungrateful in the land
—a little enjoyment—again, their place of shelter will be hell. And it will be a miserable Final Place
But those who were Godfearing of their Lord, for them will be Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever, a hospitality from God. And what is with God is best for the pious
And, truly, among the People of the Book are those who believe in God and what was caused to descend to you and what was caused to descend to them, ones who are humble toward God. They exchange not the signs of God for a little price. Those, for them, their compensation is with their Lord. And, truly, God is Swift in reckoning
O those who believed! Excel in patience and be steadfast. And be Godfearing of God so that perhaps you will prosper
O humanity! Be Godfearing of your Lord Who created you from a single soul and, from it, created its spouse and from them both disseminated many men and women. And be Godfearing of God through Whom you demand rights of one another and the wombs, the rights of blood relations. Truly, God had been watching over you
And give the orphans their property and take not in exchange the bad of yours for what is good of theirs. And consume not their property with your own property. Truly, this had been criminal, a hateful sin
And if you feared that you will not act justly with the orphans, then, marry who seems good to you of the women, by twos, in threes or four. But if you feared you will not be just, then, one or what your right hands possessed. That is likelier that you not commit injustice
And give wives their marriage portion as a spontaneous gift. Then, truly, if they (f) were pleased to offer to you anything of it on their (f) own, consume it wholesomely with repose
And give not the mentally deficient your wealth that God assigned to you to maintain for them, but provide for them from it and clothe them. And say honorable sayings to them
And test the orphans until when they reached the age for marriage. Then, if you observed them to be of right judgment, then, release their property to them and consume it not excessively and hastily, for they will develop. And whoever had been rich, let him have restraint and whoever had been poor, then, let him consume as one who is honorable. And when you released their property to them, call witnesses over them. And God sufficed as a Reckoner
For men is a share of what was left by the ones who are their parents and the nearest kin. And for women is a share of what was left by the ones who are their parents and nearest kin whether it was little or it was much—an apportioned share
And when the division is attended by those imbued with kinship and the orphans and the needy, then, provide for them from it and say honorable sayings to them
And let executors dread like those who, if they left behind weak offspring, would fear for them. Then, let them be Godfearing of God and let them say appropriate sayings
Truly, those who consume the wealth of orphans with injustice, consume only fire into their bellies and they will roast in a blaze
God enjoins you concerning your children. For the male, the like allotment of two females. And if there had been women, more than two, then, for them (f) two-thirds of what he left. But if there had been one, then, for her is half. And for one’s parents, for each one of them a sixth of what he left, if he would have a child. Then, if he be with no child and his parents inherited, then, a third to his mother. Then, if he had brothers, then a sixth for his mother. This is after any bequest he enjoins or any debt. Your parents or your children, you are not informed which of them is nearer to you in profit. This is a duty to God. Truly, God had been Knowing, Wise
And for you is a half of what your spouses left if they be with no child. Then, if they (f) had a child, then, for you is a fourth of what they (f) left. This is after any bequest which they bequeath or any debt. And for them (f) a fourth of what you left if you be with no child. And if you had a child, then, for them (f) is an eighth of what you left. This is after any bequest which you bequeath or any debt. And if a man would have no direct heirs, or a woman, but indirect heirs, and has a brother or sister, then, for each one of them (f), a sixth. Then, if there would be more than that, then, they would be ascribed associates in a third. This is after any bequest which is bequeathed or any debt without being one who presses the heirs. This is the enjoinment from God. And God is Knowing, Forbearing
These are the ordinances of God. And whoever obeys God and His Messenger, He will cause to enter Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever. And that is the winning the sublime triumph
And whoever rebels against God and His Messenger and violates His ordinances, He will cause him to enter fire, one who shall dwell in it forever and he will have a despised punishment
And those who approach indecency among your wives, call to four among you to bear witness against them (f). Then, if they bore witness to the affair, then, hold them (f) back in their houses until death gathers them (f) to itself or God makes a way for them (f)
And those two who among you approach that, then penalize them both. Then, if they repented and made things right, then, turn aside from them. Truly, God had been Accepter of Repentance, Compassionate
To turn only to God for forgiveness is for those who do evil in ignorance and, again, soon they are remorseful. Then, those are whom God turns to in forgiveness. And God had been Knowing, Wise
And there is not remorsefulness for those who do evil deeds until when one of them was attended by death, he would say: I, truly, repented now nor for those who die while they are ones who are ungrateful. Those, We made ready for them a painful punishment
O those who believed! It is not lawful for you that you inherit women unwillingly, and place not difficulties for them (f) so that you take away some of what you gave them (f), unless they approach a manifest indecency. And live as one who is honorable with them (f). Then, if you disliked them (f) perhaps you dislike something in which God makes much good
And if you wanted to exchange your spouse in place of another spouse and you gave one of them (f) a hundredweight, so take not anything from it. Would you take it by false charges to harm her reputation and in clear sin
And how would you take it when one of you had sexual intercourse with the other and they (f) took from you an earnest solemn promise
And marry not women whom your fathers married unless it was in the past. Truly, it had been an indecency and repugnant and how evil a way
Your mothers were forbidden to you and your daughters and your sisters and your paternal and maternal aunts and daughters of your brothers and daughters of your sisters and your foster mothers, those who breast fed you, and your sisters through fosterage and mothers of your wives and your stepdaughters, those who are in your care from wives, those with whom you have lain—but if you have not yet lain with them (f), then there is no blame on you; and wives of your sons who are of your loins; and that you should not gather two sisters together unless it be from the past. Truly, God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
Forbidden to you are the ones who are married women, but from females whom your right hands (f) possessed. This is prescribed by God for you. And were permitted to you those who were beyond these so that with your wealth you be looking as males, ones who seek wedlock, not as ones who are licentious males. For what you enjoyed of it from them (f), give them (f) their bridal due as their dowry portion. And there is no blame on you for what you agreed on among yourselves after the duty. Truly, God had been Knowing, Wise
And whoever of you is not affluent to be able to marry the ones who are free, chaste females, the female believers, then, from females whom your right hands possessed, the ones who are female spiritual warriors, female believers And God is greater in knowledge about your belief. You are of one another. So marry them (f) with the permission of their people, and give them (f) their bridal due as one who is honorable, they being ones who are free, chaste females, without being ones who are licentious females, nor females, ones who take lovers to themselves. And when they (f) are in wedlock, if they (f) approached indecencies, then on them is half of the ones who are free, chaste females of the punishment. That is for those who dreaded fornication among you. And that you endure patiently is better for you. God is Forgiving, Compassionate
God wants to make manifest to you and to guide you to customs of those who were before you and to turn to you in forgiveness. And God is Knowing, Wise
God wants that He turn to you in forgiveness while those who follow their lusts want that you turn against God in a serious deviation
God wants to lighten the burden on you. And the human being was created weak
O those who believed! Consume not your wealth between you with falsehood, but that it be a transaction of agreeing together among you. And kill not yourselves. Truly, God had been Compassionate to you
But whoever accomplishes that through deep seated dislike and injustice, We will scorch him in a fire. And that would have been easy for God
If you avoid major sins that you are prohibited, We will absolve you of your minor sins and cause you to enter a generous gate
And covet not what God gave as advantage of it to some of you over others. For men is a share of what they deserved and for women is a share of what they (f) deserved. And ask God for His grace. Truly, God had been Knowing of everything
And to everyone We assigned inheritors to what the ones who are your parents and the nearest kin left. And those with whom you made an agreement with your sworn oaths, then, give them their share. Truly, God had been Witness over everything
Men are supporters of wives because God gave some of them an advantage over others and because they spent of their wealth. So the females, ones in accord with morality are the females, ones who are morally obligated and the females, ones who guard the unseen of what God kept safe. And those females whose resistance you fear, then admonish them (f) and abandon them (f) in their sleeping places and go away from them (f). Then if they (f) obeyed you, then look not for any way against them (f). Truly, God had been Lofty, Great
And if you feared a breach between the two, then, raise up an arbiter from his people and an arbiter from her people. If they both want to make things right, God will reconcile it between the two. Truly, God had been Knowing, Aware
And worship God and ascribe nothing as partners with Him. And kindness to the ones who are your parents and to the possessors of kinship and the orphans and the needy, to the neighbor who is as a possessor of strangeness and the neighbor who is kin and to the companion by your side and the traveler of the way and whom your right hands possessed. Truly, God loves not ones who had been proud, boastful
those who are misers and command humanity to miserliness and keep back what God gave them of His grace. And We made ready for the ones who are ungrateful a despised punishment
and for those who spend their wealth to show off to humanity and believe neither in God nor in the Last Day. And to whomever Satan would be a comrade, then how evil a comrade
And what would be for them if they believed in God and the Last Day and spent out of what God provided them? God had been Knowing of them
Truly, God does not wrong even the weight of an atom. And if there be benevolence, He multiplies it and gives that which proceeds from His Presence a sublime compensation
Then, how will it be when We brought about from each community a witness and We brought thee about as witness against these
On a Day those who were ungrateful and rebelled against the Messenger will wish that the earth be shaped over them but they will not keep back God’s discourse
O those who believed! Come not near the formal prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying nor defiled but as one who passes through a way until you wash yourselves. And if you had been sick or on a journey or one of you drew near from the privy or you came into sexual contact with your wives and you find no water, then, aim at getting wholesome, dry earth. Then, wipe your faces and your hands. Truly, God had been Pardoning, Forgiving
Hast thou not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They exchange fallacy and they want you to go astray from the way
And God is greater in knowledge of your enemies. And God sufficed as a protector. And God sufficed as a helper
Among those who became Jews are those who tamper with words out of context. They say: We heard and we rebelled and: Hear—without being one who is caused to hear and: Look at us—distorting their tongues and discrediting the way of life. And if they said: We heard and we obeyed and: Hear thou and: Wait for us, it would have been better for them and more upright, except God cursed them for their ingratitude. So they believe not but a few
O those who were given the Book! Believe in what We sent down, that which establishes as true what was with you, before We obliterate faces, and repel them backward or curse them as We cursed the Companions of the Sabbath. And the command of God had been one that is accomplished
Truly, God forgives not to ascribe partners with Him and He forgives other than that whomever He wills. And whoever ascribes partners with God, then, surely, he devised a serious sin
Hast thou not considered those who make themselves seem pure? Nay! God makes pure whom He wills and they will not be wronged in the least
Look on how they devise a lie against God; and it sufficed as clear sin
Hast thou not considered those who were given a share of the Book? They believe in false gods and false deities and they say to those who were ungrateful: These are better guided than those who believed in the way
Those are those whom God cursed. And for whomever God curses, then, thou wilt not find a helper for him
Or share they in the dominion? Then, they give not humanity in the least
Are they jealous of humanity for what God gave them of His grace? Then, surely, We gave the people of Abraham the Book and wisdom and We gave them a sublime dominion
Then, among them are some who believed in him and among them are some who barred him. And hell sufficed for a blaze
Truly, those who were ungrateful for Our signs, We will scorch them in a fire. As often as their skins were wholly burned, We will substitute with other skins so that they will experience the punishment. Truly, God had been Almighty, Wise
And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, We will cause them to enter into Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever, eternally. For them in it will be purified spouses. And We will cause them to enter into plenteous shady shadow
Truly, God commands you to give back trusts to the people. And when you gave judgment between humanity, give judgment justly. Truly, how excellent God admonishes you of it. Truly, God had been Hearing, Seeing
O those who believed! Obey God and obey the Messenger and those imbued with authority among you. Then, if you contended with one another in anything, refer it to God and the Messenger if you had been believing in God and the Last Day. That is better and a fairer interpretation
Hast thou not considered those who claim that they believed in what was caused to descend to thee and what was caused to descend before thee? They want to take their disputes to another for judgment—to false deities—while they were commanded to disbelieve in them, but Satan wants to cause them to go astray—a far wandering astray
And when it was said to them: Approach now to what God caused to descend and approach now to the Messenger, thou hadst seen the ones who are hypocrites barring thee with hindrances
How then will it be when they are lit on by an affliction for what their hands put forward? Again, they drew near thee, swearing by God: Truly, we wanted but kindness and conciliation
They are those whom God knows what is in their hearts. So turn aside from them and admonish them and say to them concerning themselves penetrating sayings
And We never sent a Messenger, but he is obeyed with the permission of God. And if, when they did wrong themselves, they drew near to thee and asked for the forgiveness of God and the Messenger asked for forgiveness for them, they found God Accepter of Repentance, Compassionate
But no! By thy Lord! They will not believe until they make thee a judge in what they disagreed about between them. Again, they find within themselves no impediment to what thou hadst decided, resigning themselves to submission, full submission
And if We prescribed for them that you: Kill yourselves, or: Go forth from your abodes, they would not have accomplished it, but a few of them. And had they accomplished what they are admonished by it, it would have been better for them and a stauncher confirming
And, then, We would have given them from that which proceeds from Our Presence a sublime compensation
And We would have guided them on a straight path
And whoever obeys God and the Messenger, those are to whom God was gracious among the Prophets and just persons and the witnesses and the ones in accord with morality. And excellent were those as allies
That is the grace from God. And God sufficed as Knowing
O those who believed! Take your precautions. Then, move forward in companies of men or move forward altogether
And, truly, among you is he who lingers behind. Then, if affliction lit on you, he would say: Surely, God was gracious to me that I not be a witness to them
And if the grace of God lit on you, certainly, he would say, as if there be not any affection between you and between him: Would that I had been with them so that I would have won a triumph, winning a sublime triumph
Then, let fight in the way of God those who sell this present life for the world to come. And whoever fights in the way of God, then, is slain or is vanquished, We will give him a sublime compensation
And why should you not fight in the way of God and for the ones taken advantage of due to weakness among the men and the women and the children, those who say: Our Lord! Bring us out from this town whose people are the ones who are unjust and assign for us a protector from Thy Presence and assign for us a helper from Thy Presence
Those who believed fight in the way of God. And those who were ungrateful fight in the way of the false deity. So fight the protectors of Satan. Truly the cunning of Satan had been weak
Hast thou not considered those who when it was said to them: Limit your hands from warfare and perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms? Then, when fighting was prescribed for them, there was a group of people among them who dread humanity, even dreading God or with a more severe dreading, and they said: Our Lord! Why hadst Thou prescribed fighting for us? Why hadst Thou not postponed it for another near term for us? Say: The enjoyment of the present is little and the world to come is better. For whomever was Godfearing, you will not be wronged in the least
Wherever you be, death will overtake you, even if you had been in imposing towers. And when benevolence lights on them, they say: This is from God. And when an evil deed lights on them, they say: This is from thee. Say: All is from God. So what is with these folk that they understand almost no discourse
Whatever of benevolence lit on thee is from God. And whatever evil deeds lit on thee, then, is from thyself. And We sent thee to humanity as a Messenger. And God sufficed as Witness
Whoever obeys the Messenger, surely, obeyed God and whoever turned away, then We sent thee not as a guardian over them
And they say: Obedience! Then, when they departed from thee, a section of them spent the night planning on other than what thou hast said. And God records what they spend the night planning. So turn aside from them and put thy trust in God. And God sufficed as Trustee
But no! They meditate not on the Recitation. And if it had been from other than God, certainly, they would have found in it many contradictions
Whenever drew near them a command of public safety or fear, they broadcasted it. But if they referred it to the Messenger, and to those imbued with authority among them, they would have known it—those who investigate from among them. And if it were not for the grace of God on you and His mercy, certainly, you would have followed Satan, but a few
So fight thou in the way of God. Thou art not placed with a burden but for thyself. And encourage the ones who believe. Perhaps God will limit the might of those who were ungrateful. And God is Stauncher in might and Stauncher in making an example
Whoever intercedes with a benevolent intercession, there will be for himself a share of it. And whoever intercedes with an intercession for bad deeds, there will be for himself a like part of it. And God had been over everything One Who Oversees
And when you were given greetings with greetings, then, give greetings fairer than that or return the same to them. Truly, God had been over everything a Reckoner
God, there is no god but He. He will, certainly, gather you on the Day of Resurrection. There is no doubt about it. And who is one who is more sincere in discourse than God
Then, what is it with you that you be two factions concerning the ones who are hypocrites? And God overthrew them for what they earned? Want you to guide whom God caused to go astray? And whomever God causes to go astray, thou wilt never find for him a way
They wished for you to be ungrateful as they were ungrateful so you become equals. So take not to yourselves protectors from them until they emigrate in the way of God. Then, if they turned away, then, take them and kill them wherever you found them. And take not to yourselves from them either a protector or a helper
but those who reach out to a folk who between you and between them is a solemn promise or when they drew near to you, their breasts were reluctant that they fight you or they fight their folk? And if God willed, He would have given them authority over you and they would have fought you. So if they withdrew from you and fight not against you and gave a proposal of surrender to you, then, God has not assigned any way for you against them
You will find others who want that they be safe from you and that they be safe from their folk. Whenever they were returned to temptation, they were overthrown in it. So if they withdraw not from you, nor give a proposal of surrender to you and limit not their hands, then, take them and kill them wherever you came upon them. And those, We made for you a clear authority against them
And it had not been for the one who believes to kill one who believes unless by error. And whoever killed one who believes by error the letting go of a believing bondsperson and blood money should be handed over to his family unless that family be charitable. And if he had been from the enemy folk of yours and he be one who believes, then, there should be the letting go of a believing bondsperson. And if he had been of a folk who between you and between them is a solemn promise, then, blood money should be handed over to the family and the letting go of a believing bondsperson. Then, whoever finds not the means, then, formally fast for two successive months as a penance from God. And God had been Knowing, Wise
And whoever kills one who believes as one who is willful, then, his recompense is hell, one who will dwell in it forever. And God was angry with him and cursed him and He prepared for him a tremendous punishment
O those who believed! When you traveled in the way of God, then be clear and say not to whomever gave you a proposal of peace: Thou art not one who believes, looking for advantage in this present life. With God is much gain. Thus, you had been like that before, then God showed grace to you, so be clear. Truly, God had been Aware of what you do
Not on the same level are the ones who sit at home among the ones who believe—other than those imbued with disability—and the ones who struggle in the way of God with their wealth and their lives. God gave advantage to the ones who struggle with their wealth and their lives by a degree over the ones who sit at home. And to each God promised the fairer. And God gave advantage to the ones who struggle over the ones who sit at home with a sublime compensation
degrees from Him and forgiveness and mercy. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
Truly, those whom the angels gathered to themselves—ones who are unjust to themselves—they will say: In what condition had you been? They will say: We had been ones taken advantage of due to weakness on the earth. They will say: Be not the earth of God that which is extensive enough to emigrate in it? Then, for those, their place of shelter will be hell. And how evil a Homecoming
But the ones taken advantage of due to weakness of the men and the women and the children who are neither able to access some means, nor are they truly guided to the way
then those, perhaps God will pardon them. And God had been Pardoning, Forgiving
And whoever emigrates in the way of God will find in and on the earth many places of refuge and plenty. And whoever goes forth from his house as one who emigrates for God and His Messenger, and, again, death overtakes him, then, surely, his compensation will fall on God. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
And when you traveled on the earth, there is no blame on you if you shorten the formal prayer if you feared that you would be persecuted by those who were ungrateful. The ones who are ungrateful, they had been for you a clear enemy
And when thou hadst been among them, performing the formal prayer with them, let a section of them stand up with thee and take their weapons. And when they prostrated themselves, then, let them move behind you and let another section approach who has not yet formally prayed. Then, let them formally pray with thee and let them take their precaution and their weapons. Those who were ungrateful wished for you to be heedless of your weapons and your sustenance. They would turn against you with a single turning. And there is no blame on you if you had been annoyed because of rain or you had been sick that you lay down your weapons. And take precaution for yourselves. Truly, God prepared for the ones who are ungrateful a despised punishment
Then, when you satisfied the formal prayer, then, remember God when upright and sitting and on your sides. And, then, when you were secured, perform the formal prayer. Truly, the formal prayer had been —for the ones who believe— a timed prescription
And be not feeble in looking for the folk. If you be suffering, they suffer as you suffer, yet you hope for from God what they hope not for, and God had been Knowing, Wise
Truly, We caused to descend to thee the Book with The Truth so that thou wilt give judgment between humanity by what God caused thee to see. And be thou not the pleader for ones who are traitors
And ask God for forgiveness. Truly, God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
And dispute not for those who are dishonest to themselves. Truly, God loves not anyone who had been a sinful betrayer
They conceal themselves from humanity, but they conceal themselves not from God, as He is with them when they spend the night planning with sayings with which He is not well-pleased. God had been One Who Encloses what they do
Lo, behold! You are these who disputed for them in this present life. Then, who will dispute with God for them on the Day of Resurrection? Or who will be a trustee over them
And whoever does evil or does wrong to himself, again, asks for forgiveness from God will, truly, find God Forgiving, Compassionate
And whoever earns a sin, truly, he earns it only against himself. And God had been Knowing, Wise
And whoever earns a transgression or a sin, and, again, accuses an innocent one, surely, laid a burden on himself of false charges that harm another’s reputation and a clear sin
And were it not for the grace of God on thee and His mercy, a section of them was about to do something that would cause thee to go astray. And they cause none to go astray but themselves and they injure thee not at all. And God caused the Book to descend to thee and wisdom and taught thee what thou art not knowing. The grace of God had been sublime upon thee
No good is there in most of their conspiring secretly, but for him who commanded charity or one who is honorable or makes things right between humanity. And whoever accomplishes that—looking for the goodwill of God—then, We will give him a sublime compensation
And whoever makes a breach with the Messenger after the guidance became clear to him and follows a way other than that of the ones who believe, We will turn him away from what he turns to and We will scorch him in hell. How evil a Homecoming
Truly, God forgives not to ascribe partners with Him. And He forgives other than that whomever He wills. And whoever ascribes partners with God, then, surely, went astray, a wandering far astray
They call to other than Him none but female gods and they call to but the rebellious Satan
God cursed him.• And Satan said: Truly, I will take to myself of Thy servants, an apportioned share
and I will cause them to go astray. And I will fill them with false desires. And I will command them, then they will slit the ears of the flocks. And I will command them, and they will alter the creation of God. And whoever takes Satan to himself for a protector other than God, then, surely, he lost, a clear loss
Satan promises them and fills them with false desires and Satan promises them nothing but delusion
Those, their place of shelter will be hell and they will find no way to escape from it
But those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, We will cause them to enter Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever, eternally. The promise of God is true. And who is One More Sincere in speech than God
Paradise will be neither after your fantasies, nor the fantasies of the People of the Book. Whoever does evil will be given recompense for it and he will not find for himself other than God either a protector or a helper
And whoever does as the ones in accord with morality—whether male or female—and is one who believes then, those will enter the Garden and they will not be wronged, in the least
And who is fairer in the way of life than he who submitted his face to God and he is one who is a doer of good and followed the creed of Abraham, a monotheist? And God took Abraham to Himself as a friend
And to God is whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. And God had been One Who Encloses everything
And they ask thee for advice about women. Say: God pronounces to you about them (f) and what is recounted to you in the Book about women who have orphans, those to whom (f) you give not what was prescribed for them (f) because you prefer that you marry them (f) and about the ones taken advantage of due to weakness among children and that you stand up for the orphans with equity. And whatever you accomplish of good, then, truly, God had been Knowing of it
And if a woman feared resistance or turning aside from her husband no blame on either of them that they make things right between the two, that there be reconciliation. And reconciliation is better. And persons were prone to stinginess. And if you do good and are Godfearing, then, truly, God had been Aware of what you do
You will never be able to be just between wives, even if you were eager so incline not with total inclination away from her, forsaking her as if she be one who is in suspense. And if you make things right and are Godfearing, then, truly, God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
And if the two split up, God will enrich each of them from all His plenty. And God had been One Who is Extensive, Wise
And to God is whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth and, certainly, We charged those who were given the Book before you, and to you, that you be Godfearing of God alone. And if you are ungrateful, then, truly, to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. And God had been Sufficient, Worthy of Praise
And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. And God sufficed as a Trustee
If He wills, He will cause you to be put away—O humanity—and approach with others. And over that God had been Powerful
Whoever had been wanting a reward for good deeds in the present, then with God is The Reward for good deeds in the present and in the world to come. And God had been Hearing, Seeing
O those who believed! Be staunch in equity as witnesses to God even against yourselves or the ones who are your parents or the nearest of kin, whether you would be rich or poor, then God is Closer to both than you are. So follow not your desires that you become unbalanced. And if you distort or turn aside, then, truly, God had been Aware of what you do
O those who believed! Believe in God and His Messenger and the Book which He sent down to His Messenger and the Book that He caused to descend before. And whoever is ungrateful to God and His angels and His Books and His Messengers and the Last Day, then, surely, went astray, a wandering far astray
Truly those who believed, and, again, disbelieved, and, again, believe and, again, disbelieve, and, again, added to disbelief, neither will God be forgiving of them nor guide them to a way
Give thou good tidings to the ones who are hypocrites that, truly, for them is a painful punishment
those who take to themselves the ones who are ungrateful as their protectors instead of the ones who believe! Are they looking for great glory with them? Truly, then, all great glory belongs to God alone
And, surely, He sent down to you in the Book that when you heard the signs of God being unappreciated and being ridiculed, then, and sit not with them until they discuss in conversation about other than that or else, you will be like them. Truly, God is One Who Gathers the ones who are hypocrites and the ones who are ungrateful altogether in hell
Those who lie in wait for you, if there had been a victory from God for you, they would say: Have we not been with you? If the ones who are ungrateful had been with a share, they would say: Gain we not mastery over you and secure you from among the ones who believe? And God will give judgment between you on the Day of Resurrection. God will never assign the ones who are ungrateful any way over the ones who believe
Truly, the ones who are hypocrites seek to trick God. And He is The One Who Deceives them, and when they stood up for formal prayer, they stood up lazily to make display to humanity. And they remember not God but a little
ones who are wavering between this and that, neither with these, nor with these. And whom God causes to go astray, thou wilt never find a way for him
O those who believed! Take not to yourselves the ones who are ungrateful as protectors instead of the ones who believe. Want you to assign to God clear authority against yourselves
Truly, the ones who are hypocrites will be in the lowest, deepest reaches of the fire. And thou wilt not find for them any helper
but those who repented and made things right and cleaved firmly to God and made sincere their way of life for God, then, those will be with the ones who believe. And God will give the ones who believe a sublime compensation
What would God accomplish by your punishment if you gave thanks to Him and believed in Him? God had been One Who is Responsive, Knowing
God loves not the open publishing of evil sayings, the open publishing of evil sayings, but by him who was wronged. God had been Hearing, Knowing
If you show good or conceal it or pardon evil, then, truly, God had been Pardoning, Powerful
Truly, those who are ungrateful to God and His Messengers and they want to separate and divide between God and His Messengers and they say: We believe in some and we disbelieve in others, they want that they take themselves to a way between that
Those, they are, in truth, the ones who are ungrateful. We made ready for the ones who are ungrateful a despised punishment
And those who believed in God and His Messengers and they separate and divide not between any of them, those, He will give them their compensation. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
The People of the Book ask thee that thou hast sent down to them a Book from heaven. Surely, they had asked Moses for greater than that. Then, they said: Cause us to see God publicly. So a thunderbolt took them for their injustice. Again, they took the calf to themselves after what drew near to them—the clear portents. Even so We pardoned that. And We gave Moses a clear authority
And We exalted the mount above them for their solemn promise. And We said to them: Enter the door as ones who prostrate themselves. And We said to them: Disregard not the Sabbath! And We took from them an earnest solemn promise
for their breaking their solemn promise and their ingratitude for the signs of God and their killing the Prophets without right and their saying: Our hearts are encased. Nay! God set a seal on them for their ingratitude—so they believe not but a few—
and for their ingratitude and their saying against Mary serious, false charges to harm her reputation
and for their saying: We killed the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, the Messenger of God. And they killed him not, nor they crucified him. Rather, a likeness to him of another was shown to them. And, truly, those who were at variance in it are in uncertainty about it. There is no knowledge with them about it but they are pursuing an opinion. And they for certain killed him not
Nay! God exalted him to Himself. And God had been Almighty, Wise
Yet there is none among the People of the Book but will, surely, believe in Jesus before his death. And on the Day of Resurrection he will be a witness against them
So for the injustice of those who became Jews, We forbade them what was good that was permitted to them and for their barring many from the way of God
and for their taking usury—although they were prohibited from it—and for their consuming the wealth of humanity with falsehood. We made ready for the ones who are ungrateful among them a painful punishment
But the ones who are firmly rooted in knowledge among them and the ones who believe, they believe in what was caused to descend to thee and what was caused to descend before thee. They are the ones who perform the formal prayer. And they are the ones who give the purifying alms. They are the ones who believe in God and the Last Day. It is those to whom We will give a sublime compensation
Truly, We revealed to thee, as We revealed to Noah and the Prophets after him. And We revealed to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes and Jesus and Job and Jonah and Aaron and Solomon. And We gave David the Psalms
And Messengers We related to thee before and Messengers We relate to thee not. God spoke directly to Moses, speaking directly
Messengers are ones who give good tidings and ones who warn so that humanity not be in disputation against God after the Messengers. And God had been Almighty, Wise
And God bears witness to what He caused to descend to thee. He caused it to descend with His knowledge. And the angels also bear witness. And God sufficed as witness
Truly, those who were ungrateful and barred others from the way of God, they, surely, went astray, a wandering far astray
Truly, those who were ungrateful and did wrong, God will never be forgiving of them, nor guide them to a road
but the road to hell, ones who will dwell in it forever, eternally. And that had been easy for God
O humanity! Surely, the Messenger drew near you with The Truth from your Lord. So believe, it is better for you. And if you are ungrateful, then, truly, to God is whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And God had been Knowing, Wise
O People of the Book! Go not beyond the limits in your way of life and say not about God but The Truth: That the Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, was a Messenger of God and His Word that He cast to Mary and a Spirit from Him. So believe in God and His Messengers. And say not: Three. To refrain yourselves from it is better for you. There is only One God. Glory be to Him that He have a son! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth and God sufficed as a Trustee
The Messiah will never disdain that he be a servant of God nor the angels, the ones who are brought near to Him. And whoever disdains His worship and grows arrogant, He will assemble them altogether to Himself
Then, as for those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, then, He will pay their compensation in full and increase His grace for them. And as for those who disdained and grew arrogant, He will punish them with a painful punishment. They will not find for themselves other than God a protector or a helper
O humanity! Surely, there drew near you proof from your Lord. And We caused to descend to you a clear light
So for those who believed in God and cleaved firmly to Him, then, He will cause them to enter into mercy from Him and grace and guide them to Himself on a straight path
They ask thee for advice. Say: God pronounces to you about indirect heirs. If a man perished and he be without children and he has a sister, then, for her is half of what he left. And he inherits from her if she be without children. And if there had been two sisters, then, for them (f), two-thirds of what he left. And if there had been brothers/sisters, men and women, the man will have the like allotment as two females. God makes manifest to you so that you go not astray, and God is Knowing of everything
O those who believed! Live up to your agreements. Flocks of animals were permitted to you, but what is now recounted to you: You are not ones who are permitted hunting while you are in pilgrim sanctity. Truly, God gives judgment how He wants
O those who believed! Profane not the waymarks of God nor the Sacred Month nor the sacrificial gift nor the garlanded nor ones who are bound for the Sacred House looking for grace from their Lord and contentment. And when you left your pilgrim sanctity, then, hunt. And let not that you detest a folk who barred you from the Masjid al-Haram drive you into exceeding the limits.• And cooperate with one another in virtuous conduct and God-consciousness and cooperate not with one another in sin and deep seated dislike. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Severe in repayment
Carrion was forbidden to you and blood and flesh of swine and what of it was hallowed to other than God and the one that is a strangled beast and the one that is beaten to death and the animal one fallen to its death and the animal gored to death or eaten by a beast of prey—but what you slew lawfully—and what were sacrificed to fetishes and what you partition by divining arrows. That is contrary to moral law. Today, those who were ungrateful gave up hope because of your way of life. So dread them not but dread Me. Today, I perfected your way of life for you and I fulfilled My divine blessing on you and I was well-pleased with submission to the One God for your way of life. Whoever was driven by necessity due to emptiness—not one who inclines to sin—then, truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
They ask thee what was permitted to them. Say: That which is good was permitted to you and what you taught of hunting creatures, as one who teaches hunting dogs of what God taught you. So eat of what they seized for you and remember the Name of God over it and be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Swift in reckoning
Today, what is good was permitted to you. The food of those to whom We gave the Book is allowed to you and your food is allowed to them. And the ones who are free, chaste females from the females, ones who believe and the ones who are free, chaste females from among those who were given the Book before you when you were to give them their bridal due, as males, ones who seek wedlock, not as ones who are licentious males, nor as males, ones who take lovers to themselves. And whoever disbelieves after belief, then, surely, his actions will be fruitless. And he in the world to come will be among the ones who are losers
O those who believed! When you stood up for the formal prayer, then, wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows and wipe your heads and your feet up to the ankles. If you had been defiled, then, cleanse yourselves. And if you had been sick or on a journey or one of you drew near from the privy or you came into sexual contact with your wives and you find no water, then, aim at getting wholesome, dry earth and wipe your faces and hands with it. God wants not to make any impediment for you and He wants to purify you and to fulfill His divine blessing on you, so that perhaps you will give thanks
And remember the divine blessing of God on you and His solemn promise that he made as a covenant with you by it when you said: We heard and we obeyed. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Knowing of what is in the breasts
O those who believed! Be staunch in equity as witnesses to God and let not that you detest a folk drive you into not dealing justly. Be just. That is nearer to God-consciousness. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Aware of what you do
And God promised those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality that for them is forgiveness and a sublime compensation
And those who were ungrateful and denied Our signs, those will be the Companions of Hellfire
O those who believed! Remember the divine blessing of God on you when they, a folk, were about to extend their hands against you, but He limited their hands from you. And be Godfearing of God. And in God let the ones who believe put their trust
And, certainly, God took a solemn promise from the Children of Israel and We raised up among them twelve chieftains. And God said: Truly, I am with you. If you performed the formal prayer and gave the purifying alms and believed in My Messengers and you supported them and you lent God a fairer loan, I would, certainly, absolve you of your evil deeds. And I would, certainly, cause you to enter Gardens beneath which rivers run. Then, whoever among you was ungrateful after this, then, surely, he went astray from the right way
Then, for their breaking their solemn promise, We cursed them and We made their hearts ones that harden. They tamper with the words out of context and they forgot an allotment of what they were reminded of in it. Thou wilt not cease to peruse the treachery of them, but a few of them. Then, overlook and pardon them. Truly, God loves the ones who are doers of good
And from those who said: We are Christians, We took their solemn promise, but they forgot an allotment of what they were reminded of it so We stirred up enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection. And God will tell them of what they had been crafting
O People of the Book! Surely, Our Messenger drew near you. He makes manifest to you much of what you had been concealing of the Book and pardons much. Surely, from God drew near you a light and a clear Book
God guides with it whoever followed His contentment to ways of peace and He brings them out from the shadows into the light with His permission and He guides them to a straight path
Certainly, ungrateful were those who said: Truly, God is the Messiah, the son of Mary. Say: Who, then, has any sway over God? If He wanted to He would cause the Messiah son of Mary and his mother to perish and whatever is in and on the earth altogether. To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between the two. He creates what He wills. And God is Powerful over everything
And the Jews and Christians said: We are the children of God and His beloved. Say: Why, then, does He punish you for your impieties? Nay! You are mortals whom He created. He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is even between the two. And to Him is the Homecoming
O People of the Book! Surely, Our Messenger drew near you. He makes manifest to you the way of life—after an interval without Messengers—so that you say not: There drew not near us either a bearer of good tidings or a warner. Then, surely, drew near to you a bearer of good tidings and a warner. And God is Powerful over everything
And mention when Moses said to his folk: O my folk! Remember the divine blessing of God on you when He assigned Prophets among you and assigned kings and gives you what He gave not to anyone of the worlds
O my folk! Enter the region, one that is sanctified, that God prescribed for you and go not back, turning your back, for, then, you will turn about as ones who are losers
They said: O Moses! Truly, in it is a haughty folk and we will never enter it until they go forth from it, but if they go forth from it, then, we will, certainly, be ones who enter
Two men to whom God was gracious said among those who fear to disobey: Enter on them through the door! And when you entered it, you will, certainly, be ones who are victors. And put your trust in God if you had been ones who believe
They said: O Moses! We will never enter it as long as they continued in it, so thou and thy Lord, you two go and fight. We are here, ones who sit at home
He said: My Lord! I control no one but myself and my brother so separate Thou between us and between the folk, the ones who disobey
He said: Truly, it is that which is forbidden to them ^for forty years.^ They will wander about the earth. So grieve not for the folk, the ones who disobey
And recount thou to them the tiding of the two sons of Adam in Truth when they both brought near a sacrifice and it was received from one of them but there is non-acceptance from the other. He said: I will, surely, kill thee. He said: Truly, God receives only from the ones who are Godfearing
If thou wert to extend thy hand against me so that thou wouldst kill me, I would not be one who stretches out my hand towards thee so that I kill thee. I fear God, Lord of the worlds
Truly, I want that thou wilt draw the burden of my sin and thy sin, then, to be among the Companions of the Fire. That is the recompense of the ones who are unjust
Then, his soul prompted him to kill his brother. And he killed him and became among the ones who are losers
Then, God raised up a raven to scratch the earth, to cause him to see how to cover up the naked corpse of his brother. He says: Woe to me! Was I unable to be like this raven to cover up the naked corpse of my brother? Then, he became among the ones who were remorseful
On account of that, We prescribed for the Children of Israel that whoever killed a person, other than in retribution for another person, or because of corruption in and on the earth, it will be as if he had killed all of humanity. And whoever gave life to one, it will be as if he gave life to all of humanity. And, certainly, our Messengers drew near them with the clear portents. Again, truly, many of them after that were ones who were excessive in and on the earth
The only recompense for those who war against God and His Messenger and hasten about corrupting in and on the earth, is that they be killed or caused to be crucified or their hands and their feet be cut off on opposite sides or they be expelled from the region. That for them is their degradation in the present. And for them in the world to come, there is a tremendous punishment
but for those who repented before you have power over them. So know you that God is Forgiving, Compassionate
O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God and look for an approach to Him and struggle in His way so that perhaps you will prosper
Truly, those who were ungrateful, if they had whatever is in and on the earth and the like of it with as much again that they offer it as ransom from the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, it would not be received from them and for them is a painful punishment
They will want to go forth from the fire, but they will not be ones who go forth from it. And for them is an abiding punishment
And as for the one who is a male thief and the one who is a female thief, then, sever their hands as recompense for what they earned, an exemplary punishment from God. And God is Almighty, Wise
But whoever repents after his injustice and made things right, then, truly, God will turn to him in forgiveness. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Hast thou not known that to God, to Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills and He forgives whom He wills. And God is Powerful over everything
O Messenger! Let them not dishearten thee—those who compete with one another in ingratitude among those who said: We believed with their mouths while their hearts believe not. ^And among those who became Jews^ are ones who hearken to lies, ones who hearken to folk of others who approach not thee. They tamper with the words out of context. They say: If you were given this, then, take it, but if you are not given this, then, beware! And for whomever God wants to test, thou wilt never have sway over him against God at all. Those are whom God wants not to purify their hearts. For them in the present is degradation. And for them in the world to come is a tremendous punishment
They are ones who hearken to lies, the ones who devour the wrongful. Then, if they drew near thee, then, give thou judgment between them or turn aside from them. And if thou hast turned aside from them, then, they will never injure thee at all. And if thou hadst given judgment, then, give judgment between them with equity. Truly, God loves the ones who act justly
And how will they make thee their judge while with them is the Torah wherein is the determination of God? Yet, again, after that, they turn away. Those are the ones who believe not
Truly, We caused the Torah to descend wherein is guidance and light. The Prophets give judgment with it, those who submitted to God, for those who became Jews and the rabbis and learned Jewish scholars who committed to memory the Book of God and they had been witnesses to it. So dread not humanity, but dread Me. And exchange not My signs for a little price. And whoever gives not judgment by what God caused to descend, those, they are the ones who are ungrateful
And We prescribed for them in it: A life for a life and an eye for an eye and a nose for a nose and an ear for an ear and a tooth for a tooth and for injuries to the body, reciprocation. Then, whoever was charitable and forgives it, it will be an atonement for him. And whoever gives judgment not by what God caused to descend, then, those, they are the ones who are unjust
And We sent following in their footsteps, Jesus son of Mary, one who establishes as true what was before him in the Torah. And We gave him the Gospel in which is guidance and light, and that which establishes as true what was before him in the Torah and a guidance and admonishment for the ones who are Godfearing
And let the People of the Gospel give judgment by what God caused to descend in it. And whoever gives not judgment by what God caused to descend, then, those, they are the ones who disobey
And We caused the Book to descend to thee with The Truth, that which establishes as true what was before it of the Book and that which preserves it. So give judgment between them by what God caused to descend. And follow not their desires that drew near thee against The Truth. For each among you We made a divine law and an open road. And if God willed, He would have made you one community to try you with what He gave you so be forward in good deeds. To God is your return altogether. Then, He will tell you about what you had been at variance in it
And give judgment between them by what God caused to descend and follow not their desires and beware of them so that they tempt thee not from some of what God caused to descend to thee. And if they turned away, then, know that God only wants that He light on them for some of their impieties. And, truly, many within humanity are ones who disobey
Look they for a determination of Age of Ignorance? And who is fairer than God in determination for a folk who are certain
O those who believed! Take not to yourselves the Jews and the Christians as protectors. Some of them are protectors of one another. And whoever among you turns away to them, then, he is of them. Truly, God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust
And thou hast seen those who in their hearts is a sickness. They compete with one another. They say: We dread that a turn of fortune should light on us. Then, perhaps God brings a victory or a command from Him? Then, they will become —from what they kept secret within themselves—ones who are remorseful
And those who believed will say: Are these they who swore an oath by God —the most earnest of sworn oaths—that they were with you? Their actions were fruitless. They became ones who are losers
O those who believed! Whoever of you goes back on his way of life, God will bring the folk whom He loves and whom love Him, humble-spirited towards the ones who believe, disdainful towards the ones who are ungrateful. They struggle in the way of God and they fear not the reproach of one who is reproached. That is the grace of God. He gives it to whom He wills. And God is One Who is Extensive, Knowing
Your protector is only God and His Messenger and those who believed and those who perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and they are ones who bow down
And whoever turns in friendship to God and His Messenger and those who believed, then, behold the Party of God. They are the ones who are victors
O those who believed! Take not to yourselves those who took to themselves your way of life in mockery and as a pastime from among those who were given the Book before you and the ones who are ungrateful, as protectors. And be Godfearing of God if you had been ones who believe
And when you cried out for formal prayer they took it to themselves in mockery and as a pastime. That is because they are a folk who are not reasonable
Say: O People of the Book! Seek you revenge on us because we believed in God and what was caused to descend to us and what was caused to descend before, while, truly, most of you are ones who disobey
Say: Will I tell thee of worse than that as a reward from God? He whom God cursed and with whom He was angry and He made some of them into apes and swine who worshiped the false deities. Those are worse placed and ones who go astray from the right way
And when they drew near you they said: We believed. And, surely, they entered with ingratitude and they, surely, went forth with it. And God is greater in knowledge of what they had been keeping back
And thou hast seen many of them competing with one another in sin and deep seated dislike and in consuming the wrongful. What they had been doing was miserable
Why prohibit not the rabbis and learned Jewish scholars their sayings of sin and their consuming the wrongful? Miserable was what they had been crafting
And the Jews said: The hand of God is one that is restricted! Restricted were their hands! And they were cursed for what they said.• Nay! His hands are ones that are stretched out: He spends how He wills. And, certainly, many of them increase by what was caused to descend to thee from thy Lord in defiance and in ingratitude. And We cast among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindled a fire of war, God extinguished it. And they hasten about corrupting in and on the earth. And God loves not the ones who make corruption
And if the People of the Book believed and were Godfearing, certainly, We would have absolved them from their evil deeds and caused them to enter into Gardens of Bliss
And if they adhered to the Torah and the Gospel—what was caused to descend to them from their Lord, they would, certainly, have eaten in abundance from above them and from beneath their feet. Among them is a community of ones who halt between two opinions. But many of them, how evil is what they do
O Messenger! State what was caused to descend to thee from thy Lord, for if thou hast not accomplished it, then, thou wilt not have stated His message. And God will save thee from the harm of humanity. Truly, God guides not the folk, the ones who are ungrateful
Say: O People of the Book! You are not based on anything until you adhere to the Torah and the Gospel and what was caused to descend to you from your Lord. And, certainly, many of them increase by what was caused to descend to thee from thy Lord in defiance and ingratitude. So grieve not for folk, the ones who are ungrateful
Truly, those who believed, those who became Jews and Sabeans and Christians—whoever believed in God and the Last Day and did as one in accord with morality, then, there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse
Certainly, We took a solemn promise from the Children of Israel and We sent Messengers to them. Whenever a Messenger drew near them with what they themselves yearn not for, a group of people denied them and a group of people kill them
And they assumed there would be no test. They were in darkness and became unhearing. Again, God turned to them in forgiveness. Again, in darkness and became unhearing many of them. And God is Seeing of what they do
And, certainly, were ungrateful those who said: Truly, God is He, the Messiah, son of Mary, but the Messiah said: O Children of Israel! Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. Truly, whoever ascribes partners with God, then, surely, God forbade the Garden to him. And his place of shelter will be the fire. And for the ones who are unjust, there are no helpers
Certainly, ungrateful were those who said: Truly, God is the third of three.• There is no god but One God. And if they refrain not themselves from what they say, there will afflict those who were ungrateful among them a painful punishment
Will they not, then, turn to God for forgiveness and ask for His forgiveness? And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
The Messiah son of Mary was not but a Messenger. Surely, Messengers passed away before him. And his mother was a just person (f). They both had been eating food. Look on how We make manifest the signs to them. Again, look on how they are misled
Say: Worship you other than God what controls neither hurt nor profit for you? And God, He is The Hearing, The Knowing
Say: O People of the Book! Go not beyond limits in your way of life but with The Truth and follow not the desires of the folk who, surely, went astray before. And they caused many to go astray. And they themselves went astray from the right way
Those who were ungrateful were cursed among the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and that of Jesus son of Mary. That was because they would rebel and they had been exceeding the limits
They had not been forbidding one another from that which is unlawful that they committed. Miserable was what they had been committing
Thou hast seen many of them turning away to those who were ungrateful. Miserable was what was put forward for them themselves so that God was displeased with them and in their punishment they are ones who will dwell in it forever
If they had been believing in God and the Prophet and what was caused to descend to him, they would not have taken them to themselves protectors, but many of them are ones who disobey
Truly, thou wilt find the hardest of humanity in enmity to those who believed are the Jews and those who have ascribed partners with God. And, certainly, thou wilt find the nearest of them in affection to those who believed are those who said: We are Christians. That is because among them are priests and monks and they grow not arrogant
And when they heard what was caused to descend to the Messenger, thou hast seen their eyes overflow with tears because they recognized The Truth. They say: Our Lord! We believed so write us down with the ones who bear witness
And why believe we not in God and in what drew near us of The Truth? And we are desirous that Our Lord would cause us to enter the Garden among the folk—the ones in accord with morality
Then, God repaid them for what they said—Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever. And that is the recompense of the ones who are doers of good
But those who are ungrateful and denied Our signs, those will be the Companions of Hellfire
O those who believed! Forbid not what is good that God permitted to you and exceed not the limits. Truly, God loves not the ones who exceed the limits
And eat of what God provided you, the lawful, what is good. And be Godfearing of God in Whom you are ones who believe
God will not take you to task for what is idle talk in your oaths, but He will take you to task for oaths you made as an agreement. Then, its expiation is the feeding of ten needy people of the average of what you feed your own people or clothing them or letting go of a bondsperson. But whoever finds not the means, then, formal fasting for three days. That is the expiation for your oaths when you swore them. And keep your oaths safe. Thus, God makes manifest His signs to you so that perhaps you will give thanks
O those who believed! Truly, intoxicants and gambling and fetishes and divining arrows are of the disgraceful actions of Satan. Then, avoid them so that perhaps you will prosper
But Satan only wants that he precipitate enmity and hatred between you through intoxicants and gambling and bar you from the remembrance of God and from formal prayer. Then, will you be ones who desist
And obey God and obey the Messenger and beware. Then, truly, if you turned away, then, know that only on Our Messenger is the delivering of Our clear message
There is not for those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality blame for what they tasted when they were Godfearing and believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and, again, they were Godfearing and believed. And, again, they were Godfearing and did good. And God loves the ones who are doers of good
O those who believed! Certainly, God will try you with something of the game that your hands and your lances attain so that God knows who fears Him in the unseen. Then, whoever exceeded the limits after that, for him is a painful punishment
O those who believed! Kill not game when you are in pilgrim sanctity. And whoever of you killed as one who is willful, then, the recompense is like what he killed of flocks by two possessors of justice who give judgment. Among you will be a sacrificial gift—that which reaches the Kabah—or the expiation of food for the needy or the equivalent of that in formal fasting so that he, certainly, experiences the mischief of his conduct. God pardoned what is past. And whoever reverted to it, then, God will requite him. And God is Almighty, Possessor of Requital
The game of the sea was permitted to you and the food of it as sustenance for you and for a company of travelers, but the game of dry land was forbidden to you as long as you continued in pilgrim sanctity. And be Godfearing of God to Whom you will be assembled
God made the Kabah the Sacred House, maintaining it for humanity and the Sacred Month and the sacrificial gift and the garlanded. That is so that you will know that God knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth and that God is Knowing of everything
Know that God is Severe in repayment and that God is Forgiving, Compassionate
What is with the Messenger is not but the delivering of the message. And God knows whatever you show and whatever you keep back
Say: Not on the same level are the bad and what is good even if the prevalence of the bad impressed thee. So be Godfearing of God, O those imbued with intuition, so that perhaps you will prosper
O those who believed! Ask not about things that if they are shown to you would raise anger in you. Yet if you ask about them at the time when the Quran is being sent down, they will be shown to you. God pardoned that which is past. And God is Forgiving, Forbearing
Surely, the folk asked about them before you. Again, they became ones who are ungrateful for it
God made not the thing called Bahirah nor Saibah nor Wasilah nor Hami, but those who were ungrateful, they devise lies against God and most of them are not reasonable
And when it was said to them: Approach now to what God caused to descend and to the Messenger, they said: Enough is what we found our fathers upon. Even though their fathers had been knowing nothing nor are they truly guided
O those who believed! Upon you is the charge of your souls. He who went astray injures you not if you were truly guided. To God is the return of you all. Then, He will tell you what you had been doing
O those who believed! Have testimony between you when death attended anyone of you. At the time of bequeathing, have two possessors of justice from among yourselves or two others from among others if you traveled through the region and the affliction of death lit on you. You will detain them both after the formal prayer. And they will swear by God. If you were in doubt about them, have them say: We will not exchange it for a price even if he had been possessing kinship. And we will not keep back testimony of God. Truly, we, then, would be among the ones who are perverted
Then, if it was ascertained that the two merited an accusation of sin, then, two others will stand up in their station from among those who are the most deserving, nearest in kinship, and they both swear an oath by God saying: Our testimony has a better right than the testimony of the other two. And we exceeded not the limits, for, truly, we, then, would be among the ones who are unjust
That is likelier that they bring testimony in proper form or they fear that their oaths will be repelled after the others’ oaths. So be Godfearing of God and hear. And God guides not the folk, the ones who disobey
On a Day when God will gather the Messengers and will say: What was your answer? They will say: We have no knowledge. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art Knower of the unseen
Mention when God said: O Jesus son of Mary! Remember My divine blessing on thee and on the one who is thy mother, when I confirmed thee, Jesus, with the hallowed Spirit so that thou hast spoken to humanity from the cradle and in manhood and when I taught thee the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel and when thou hast created from clay the likeness of a bird with My permission and thou hast breathed into it and it becomes a bird with My permission and thou hast cured one blind from birth and the leper with My permission and when thou hast brought out the dead with My permission and when I limited the Children of Israel from thee when thou hadst drawn near them with the clear portents. And those who were ungrateful among them said: This is nothing but clear sorcery
Mention when I inspired the disciples: Believe in Me and My Messenger. They said: We believed and bear witness that we are ones who submit to God
Mention when the disciples said: O Jesus son of Mary! Is thy Lord able to send down to us a table spread with food from heaven? Jesus said: Be Godfearing of God, if you had been ones who believe
They said: We want that we eat of it so that our hearts be at rest and we know that thou, surely, wast sincere to us and that we be the ones who bear witness to that
Jesus son of Mary said: O God! Our Lord! Cause to descend for us a table spread with food from heaven that it will be a festival for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from Thee. And provide us. And Thou art Best of the ones who provide
God said: Truly, I am One Who Sends Down to you. But whoever is ungrateful after that among you, then, I will punish him with a punishment that I punish not anyone of the worlds
And mention when God said: O Jesus son of Mary! Hadst thou said to humanity: Take me and my mother to yourselves other than God? He would say: Glory be to Thee! It is not for me that I say what there is no right for me to say. If I had been saying it, then, surely, Thou wouldst have known it. Thou hast known what is in my soul and I know not what is in Thy Soul. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art Knower of the unseen
I said not to them but what Thou hadst commanded me of it: That you worship God, my Lord and your Lord. And I had been witness over them as long as I continued among them. Then, when Thou hadst gathered me to Thyself, Thou hadst been The Watcher over them. Thou art, truly, Witness over everything
If Thou art to punish them, then, they are but Thy servants. And if Thou art to forgive them truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Almighty, The Wise
God would say: This Day the ones who are sincere will profit from their sincerity. For them are Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever, eternally. God was well-pleased with them and they are well-pleased with Him. That is the winning the sublime triumph
To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in and on them. And He is Powerful over everything
The Praise belongs to God Who created the heavens and the earth and made the shadows and the light. Again, those who were ungrateful to their Lord, they equate others to Him
It was He Who created you from clay, and, again, decided a term, a term, that which was determined by Him. Again, you contest
And He is God in the heavens and in and on the earth. He knows your secret and what you openly publish and He knows whatever you earn
And a sign not approaches for them from the signs of their Lord but they would be ones who turn aside from it
Then, surely, they denied The Truth when it drew near to them. Then, tidings approach them of what they had been ridiculing of it
Consider they not how many a generation before them We caused to perish? We established them firmly in and on the earth such as We firmly establish not for you. And We sent abundant rain from heaven. And We made rivers run beneath them. So We caused them to perish for their impieties and We caused to grow after them other generations
And if We sent down to thee a Book on parchment, then, they would have stretched towards it with their hands. Those who were ungrateful would have said: This is nothing but clear sorcery
And they said: Why was an angel not caused to descend to him? And, certainly, if We caused to descend an angel, the command would be decided. Again, no respite would be given to them
And if We made him an angel, certainly, We would have made him as a man and We would have confused them when they are already confused
And, certainly, Messengers were ridiculed before thee. So those who derided them were surrounded by what they had been ridiculing
Say: Journey through the earth; again, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who deny
Say: To whom is whatever is in the heavens and the earth? Say: To God. He prescribed mercy for Himself. He will, certainly, gather you on the Day of Resurrection. There is no doubt in it. Those who lost themselves that Day, then, they will not believe
And to Him belongs whatever inhabited the nighttime and the daytime. And He is The Hearing, The Knowing
Say: Will I take to myself, other than God, a protector, One Who is Originator of the heavens and the earth? And it is He who feeds and He who is never fed. Say: Truly, I was commanded: that I be the first who submitted to the One God. And thou hast not been among the ones who are polytheists
Say: Truly, I fear if I rebelled against my Lord, the punishment of the tremendous Day
He who is turned away from it on that Day, then, surely, He had mercy on him. And that is the winning the clear triumph
And if God touches thee with harm, then, no one will remove it but He. And if He touches thee with good, then, He is Powerful over everything
He is The One Who is Omniscient over His servants. And He is The Wise, The Aware
Say: Which thing is greater in testimony? Say: God is Witness between me and you. And this, the Quran, was revealed to me that I should warn you with it and whomever it reached. Truly, are you bearing witness that there are other gods with God? Say: I bear not such witness. Say: He is not but One God and I am, truly, free from partners you ascribe with Him
Those to whom We gave the Book recognize it as they recognize their own children.• But those, they who lost themselves, they believe not
And who does greater wrong than he who devised a lie against God or denied His signs. Truly, the ones who are unjust will not prosper
And on a Day We will assemble them altogether. Again, We will say to those who ascribed partners with God: Where are your ascribed associates with God whom you had been claiming
Again, their dissent will not be but that they would say: By God! Our Lord! We had not been ones who are polytheists
Look on how they have lied against themselves. Went astray with them that which they had been devising
And among them are those who listen to thee. But We laid sheathes on their hearts so that they not understand it and in their ears is a heaviness. And if they are to see every sign they will not believe in it. So that when they drew near thee, they dispute with thee. Those who were ungrateful say: This is nothing but fables of the ancient ones
And they prohibit others from it. And they withdraw aside from it. And they cause to perish, no doubt, none but themselves, but they are not aware
And if thou wouldst see when they would be stationed by the fire, they will say: Would that we be returned to life. Then, we would not deny the signs of our Lord and we would be among the ones who believe
Nay! Shown to themselves will be what they had been concealing before. And even if they were returned, they would revert to what they were prohibited from there and, truly, they are the ones who lie
They said: There is nothing but this, our present life and we are not ones who will be raised up
And if thou wouldst see when they would be stationed before their Lord. He would say: Is this not The Truth? They would say: Yea, by Our Lord. He would say: Then, experience the punishment for what you had been ungrateful
Surely, those lost who denied the meeting with God until when the Hour drew near them suddenly, they would say: What a regret for us that we neglected in it! And they will carry heavy loads on their backs. How evil is what they bear
And this present life is nothing but a pastime and diversion. And the Last Abode is better for those who are Godfearing. Will you not, then, be reasonable
Surely, We know that what they say disheartens thee. Truly, they deny thee not. Rather the ones who are unjust negate the signs of God
And, certainly, Messengers before thee were denied yet they endured patiently that they were denied and they were maligned until Our help approached them. And no one will change the Word of God. And, certainly, there drew near thee tidings of the ones who are sent
If their turning aside had been troublesome to thee, then, if thou wert able, be looking for a hole in the earth or a ladder to heaven so that thou wouldst bring them some sign. If God willed, He would have gathered them to The Guidance. Be thou not among the ones who are ignorant
It is only those who hear who respond.• As for the dead, God will raise them up. Again, they are returned to Him
And they said: Why was a sign not sent down to him from his Lord? Say: Truly, God is One Who Has Power over what sign He sends down, except most of them know not
And there is no moving creature in or on the earth, none that is a fowl flying with its two wings, but they are communities like yours. We neglected not anything in the Book. Again, they will be assembled to their Lord
And those who denied Our signs are unwilling to hear and unwilling to speak. They are in the shadows. Whomever God wills, He causes to go astray. And whomever He wills, He lays on a straight path
Say: Considered you that if the punishment of God approached you or the Hour approached you, would you call to any other than God if you had been ones who are sincere
Nay! To Him alone you would call and He would remove that for which you call to Him—if He willed—and you will forget whatever partners you ascribe with Him
And, certainly, We sent to communities that were before thee. Then, We took them with desolation and tribulation so that perhaps they will lower themselves to Us
Then, why when drew near them Our might, they lowered not themselves? Rather, their hearts became hard. And Satan made appear pleasing to them what they had been doing
So when they forgot about what they were reminded in it, We opened to them the doors of everything. Until when they were glad with what they were given, We suddenly took them. That is when they were ones who are seized with despair
So cut off were the last remnant of the folk who did wrong. And The Praise belongs to God, Lord of the worlds
Say: Considered you that if God took your having the ability to hear and your sight and sealed over your hearts, what god other than God restores them to you? Look on how We diversify the signs! Again, they still drew aside
Say: Considered you that if the punishment of God approached you suddenly or publicly, will anyone be caused to perish but the folk, the ones who are unjust
We send not the ones who are sent, but as ones who give good tidings and ones who warn. So whoever believed and made things right, then, there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse
But those who denied Our signs, the punishment will afflict them because they had been disobeying
Say: I say not to you: With me are treasures of God nor that I know the unseen nor say I to you that I am an angel. I follow only what is revealed to me. Say: Are they on the same level— the unwilling to see and the seeing? Will you, then, not reflect
And warn with the Quran those who fear that they will be assembled before their Lord. Other than He there is neither a protector nor an intercessor, so that perhaps they will be Godfearing
And drive not away those who call to their Lord in the morning and the evening, wanting His Countenance. Their reckoning is not on thee at all. And thy reckoning is not on them at all. If thou wast to drive them away, then, thou wouldst be among the ones who are unjust
Thus, We tried some of them with others that they should say: Is it these to whom God showed grace from among us? Is not God greater in knowledge of the ones who are thankful
And when drew near thee, those who believe in Our signs, say: Peace be to you. Your Lord prescribed mercy for Himself so that anyone of you who did evil in ignorance—again, repented afterwards and made things right—then, truly, He is Forgiving, Compassionate
And, thus, We explain Our signs distinctly so that the way is indicated for the ones who sin
Say: I was prohibited that I worship those whom you call to other than God. Say: I will not follow your desires, for, then, I would have gone astray. I would not be of the ones who are truly guided
Say: I am with a clear portent from my Lord and you denied it. I have not of that which you seek to hasten. The determination is with God. He relates The Truth. And He is Best of the ones who distinguish truth from falsehood
Say: Truly, if with me was what you seek to hasten, the command would be decided between me and between you. And God is greater in knowledge of the ones who are unjust
With Him are the keys of the unseen. None knows them but He. And He knows whatever is on dry land and in the sea. Not a leaf descends but He knows it, nor a grain in the shadows of the earth, nor fresh nor dry thing, but it is in a clear Book
It is He Who gathers you to Himself by nighttime and He knows what you were busy with by daytime. Again, He raises you up in it so that the term, that which is determined, is decided. Again, to Him is your return. Again, He will tell you of what you had been doing
And He is The One Who Is Omniscient over His servants. And He sends over you recorders until when death drew near one of you. Our messengers gathered him to themselves and they neglect not
Again, they would be returned to God, their Defender, The True. Is not the determination for Him? And He is The Swiftest of the ones who reckon
Say: Who delivers you from the shadows of the dry land and the sea? You call to Him humbly and inwardly: If Thou wert to rescue us from this, we will be of the ones who are thankful
Say: God delivers you from them and from every distress. And, again, you ascribe partners with Him
Say: He is The One Who Has Power to raise up on you a punishment from above you, or from beneath your feet or to confuse you as partisans and to cause you to experience the violence of some of you to one another. Look on how We diversify the signs so that perhaps they will understand
And thy folk denied it and it is The Truth. Say: I am not a trustee over you
For every tiding there is an appointed time. And you will know it
And when thou hadst seen those who engage in idle talk about Our signs, then, turn aside from them until they discuss in conversation other than that. And if Satan should cause thee to forget, then, after a reminder, sit not with the folk, the ones who are unjust
There is not on those who are Godfearing anything of their reckoning, but a reminder so that perhaps they will be Godfearing
Forsake those who took to themselves their way of life as a pastime and as a diversion and whom this present life deluded. But remind with it, the Quran, so that a soul would not be given up to destruction for what it earned. Other than God there is not for it a protector nor an intercessor. And even if it be an equitable equivalent, it will not be taken from it. Those are those who were given up to destruction for what they earned. For them is a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they had been ungrateful
Say: Will we call to other than God what can neither hurt nor profit us? And are we repelled on our heels after God guided us like one whom the satans lured, bewildered in and on the earth although he has companions who call him to the guidance saying: Approach us? Say: Truly, the guidance of God is The Guidance. And we were commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds
and to perform the formal prayer and be Godfearing of Him. And it is He to Whom you will be assembled
And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth with The Truth. And on a Day He says: Be! Then, it is! His saying is The Truth. And His is the dominion on a Day when the trumpet will be blown. He is One Who Knows of the unseen and the visible. And He is The Wise, The Aware
And mention when Abraham said to his father Azar: Hast thou taken idols to thyself as gods? Truly, I see thee and thy folk clearly wandering astray
And, thus, We cause Abraham to see the kingdom of the heavens and the earth so that he would be of the ones who are certain in belief
So when night outspread over him, he saw a star. He said: This is my Lord. Then, when it set, he said: I love not that which sets
Then, when he saw the moon, that which rises, he said: This is my Lord. Then, when it set, he said: If my Lord guides me not, certainly, I would have been among the folk, the ones gone astray
Then, when he saw the sun, that which rises, he said: This is my Lord. This is greater. Then, when it set, he said: O my folk! Truly, I am free from the partners you ascribe with Him
Truly, I turned my face to He Who Originated the heavens and the earth—as a monotheist and I am not of the ones who are polytheists
And his folk argued with him. He said: You argue with me about God while, surely, He guided me? I fear not whatever partners you ascribe with Him. When my Lord wills a thing, my Lord encompassed everything in His knowledge. Will you not, then, recollect
And how should I fear what you ascribed as partners with Him while you fear not that you ascribe as partners with God? He sends not down to you any authority for it. Then, which of the two groups of people has better right to a place of sanctuary if you had been knowing
Those who believed and confuse not their belief with injustice, those, to them belongs the place of sanctuary. And they are ones who are truly guided
And that was Our disputation that We gave Abraham against his folk. We exalt in degrees whom We will, truly, thy Lord is Wise, Knowing
And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We guided. And Noah We guided before and among his offspring are David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. And, thus, We gave recompense to the ones who are doers of good
And Zechariah and Yahya and Jesus and Elijah—all are among the ones in accord with morality
And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot. We gave all an advantage over the worlds
And from among their fathers and their offspring and their brothers/sisters, We elected them and We guided them to a straight path
That is guidance of God. He guides with it whom He wills of His servants. And if they ascribed partners with Him, what they had been doing was fruitless for them
Those are those to whom We gave the Book and critical judgment and prophethood. So if these are ungrateful for them, then, surely, We charged a folk with them who is not of the ones who are ungrateful for them
Those are those whom God guided. So imitate their guidance. Say: I ask of you no compensation for it. It is not but a reminder for the worlds
And they measured not God with His true measure when they said: God caused not to descend anything to a mortal. Say: Who caused the Book to descend that was brought about for Moses as a light and guidance for humanity? You make it into parchments. You show them some of it and conceal much of it. And you were taught what you know not, you nor your fathers. Say: God revealed it. Again, forsake them playing, engaging in their idle talk
And this is a Book We caused to descend—that which is blessed—and that which establishes as true what was before it and for thee to warn the Mother of Towns and who are around it and those who believe in the world to come believe in it. And they over their formal prayers are watchful
And who does greater wrong than he who devised lies against God or said: It was revealed to me, when nothing is revealed to him. Or who said: I will cause to descend the like of what God caused to descend. And if thou wouldst see when the ones who are unjust are in the perplexity of death and the angels—the ones who stretch out their hands will say: Relinquish your souls. Today, you will be given recompense with the humiliating punishment for what you had been saying about God other than The Truth. And you had been growing arrogant to His signs
And, certainly, you drew near Us one by one as We created you the first time. And you left what We granted you behind your backs. We see not your intercessors with you, those whom you claimed as your ascribed associates. Certainly, the bonds between you were cut asunder. And gone astray from you is what you had been claiming
Truly, it is God who is One Who Causes to Break Forth the grain and the pit of a date. He brings out the living from the dead and is One Who Brings Out the dead from the living. That is God. Then, how you are misled
He is One Who Causes to Break Forth the morning dawn and He made the night as a place of comfort and rest and the sun and the moon to keep count. That is the foreordaining of The Almighty, The Knowing
And it is He Who made the stars for you so that you will be truly guided by them in the shadows of dry land and the sea. Surely, We explained distinctly the signs for a folk who know
And it is He Who caused you to grow from a single soul, then, a temporary stay and a repository. Surely, We explained distinctly the signs for a folk who understand
And it is He Who caused to descend water from heaven. Then, We brought out from it every kind of bringing forth. Then, We brought out herbs from it. We bring out from it thick-clustered grain and from the date palm tree, from the spathe of it, thick clusters of dates, that which draws near and gardens of the grapevines and the olives and the pomegranates, like each to each and not resembling one another. Look on its fruit when it bore fruit and its ripening. Truly, in this are signs for a folk who believe
And they made as associates with God—the jinn—although He created them. And they falsely attributed to Him sons and daughters without knowledge. Glory be to Him! Exalted is He above what they allege
He is Beginner of the heavens and the earth. How would He have a child when He is without a companion and He created everything and He is Knowing of everything
That is God, your Lord. There is no god but He—the One Who is Creator of everything—so worship Him. For He is Trustee over everything
No sight overtakes Him, but He overtakes sight. And He is The Subtle, The Aware
Surely, clear evidence drew near you from your Lord. So whoever perceived, it will be for his own soul. Whoever was in darkness will be against his own soul. Say: And I am not a guardian over you
And, thus, We diversify the signs and they will say: Thou hadst received instruction and We will make the Quran manifest for a folk who know
Follow thou what was revealed to thee from thy Lord. There is no god but He. Turn thou aside from the ones who are polytheists
And if God willed, they would not have ascribed partners with Him, We made thee not a guardian over them, nor art thou a trustee for them
And offend not those who call to other than God so that they not offend God out of spite without knowledge. Thus, We made to appear pleasing the actions of every community. Again, to their Lord is their return. Then, He will tell them what they had been doing
And they swear by God the most earnest sworn oaths that if a sign would draw near them, they would, certainly, believe in it. Say: The signs are only with God. And what will cause you to realize that even if the signs were to draw near, they would not believe
We will turn around and around their minds and their sight as they believe not in it the first time. And We will forsake them in their defiance, wandering unwilling to see
And even if We sent down the angels to them and the dead spoke to them and we assembled everything against them, face to face, yet they would not believe unless God wills, except many of them are ignorant
And, thus, We made an enemy for every Prophet, satans from among humankind and the jinn. Some of them reveal to some others an ornamented saying, a delusion. And if thy Lord willed, they would not have accomplished it. So forsake them and what they devise
while minds will bend towards it of those who believe not in the world to come and they will be well-pleased with it. And they will gain what the ones who gain gain
Will I be looking for an arbiter other than God while it is He Who caused to descend to you the Book, one that is distinct? And those to whom We gave the Book, they know that it is one that is sent down by thy Lord with The Truth. So thou hast not been among the ones who contest
Completed was the Word of thy Lord in sincerity and justice. There is no one who changes His Words. And He is The Hearing, The Knowing
And if thou hast obeyed most of who are on the earth, they will cause thee to go astray from the way of God. They follow nothing but opinion and they only guess
Truly, thy Lord is He Who is greater in knowledge of who goes astray from His way. And He is greater in knowledge of the ones who are truly guided
So eat of that over which the Name of God was remembered if you had been ones who believe in His signs
And why should you not eat of that over which the Name of God was remembered on it? Surely, He explained distinctly to you what He forbade to you unless you were driven by necessity to it. And, truly, many cause others to go astray by their desires without knowledge. Truly, thy Lord, He is greater in knowledge of the ones who exceed the limits
And forsake manifest sin and its inward part. Truly, those who earn sin, they will be given recompense for what they had been gaining
Eat not of that over which the Name of God is not remembered on it. Truly, it is contrary to moral law. And, truly, the satans will reveal to their protectors so that they dispute with you and if you obeyed them, truly, you would be of the ones who are polytheists
Is he who had been lifeless and We gave him life and We made a light for him by which he walks among humanity like he who is in the shadows and is not one who goes forth from them? Thus, it was made to appear pleasing to ones who are ungrateful what they had been doing
And, thus, We made in every town greater ones who sin that they plan in it. Yet they plan not but against themselves although they are not aware
And when a sign drew near them they said: We will not believe until we are given the like of what was given to Messengers of God.• God is greater in knowledge where to assign His message. On those who sinned will light contempt from God and a severe punishment for what they had been planning
And whomever God wants, He guides him. He expands his breast for The Submission to One God. And whomever He wants to cause to go astray, He makes his breast tight, troubling, as if he had been climbing up a difficult ascent. Thus, God assigns disgrace on those who believe not
And this is the path of thy Lord, one that is straight. Surely, We explained distinctly the signs for a folk who recollect
For them is the abode of peace with their Lord. And He is their protector for what they had been doing
And mention on a Day He will assemble them altogether. O assembly of the jinn! Surely, you acquired much from humankind. And their protectors among humankind would say: Our Lord! Some of us enjoyed some others and we reached our term that was appointed by Thee for us. He would say: The fire is your place of lodging, ones who will dwell in it forever, but what God willed. Truly, thy Lord is Wise, Knowing
And, thus, that is how We make some of them friends with some others who are ones who are unjust to one another for what they had been earning
O assembly of jinn and humankind! Approach not Messengers from among yourselves relating to you My signs, and warning you of the meeting of this, your Day? They said: We bore witness against ourselves. This present life deluded them and they bore witness against themselves that they had been ones who are ungrateful
That is because thy Lord would never be One Who Causes to Perish towns unjustly while their people are ones who are heedless
And for everyone there are degrees for what they did. And thy Lord is not One Who is Heedless of what they do
Thy Lord is The Sufficient, Possessor of Mercy. If He wills, He will cause you to be put away and will make a successor after you of whomever He wills, just as He caused you to grow from offspring of other folk
Truly, what you are promised is, certainly, that which arrives and you will not be ones who frustrate it
Say: O my folk! Act according to your ability. Truly, I too am one who acts. Then, you will know for whom the Ultimate End will be the abode. Truly, the ones who are unjust will not prosper
And they assigned to God of what He made numerous of cultivation and flocks a share. Then, they said in their claim: This is for God and this is for our ascribed associates. But what had been ascribed for their associates then, reaches not out to God and what had been ascribed for God then, reaches out to their associates. How evil is the judgment they give
And, thus, made to appear pleasing to many of the ones who are polytheists was the killing of their children by those whom they ascribe as associates with Him so that they deal them destruction and so that they confuse their way of life for them. And if God willed, they would not have accomplished it. So forsake them and what they devise
And they said: These flocks and cultivation are banned. None should taste them, but whom we will, so they claim. And there are flocks whose backs were forbidden and flocks that they remember not the Name of God on it, a devising against Him. He will give them recompense for what they had been devising
And they said: What is in the bellies of these flocks is exclusively for our males and is that which is forbidden to our female spouses, but if it would be born dead, then, they are ascribed as associates in it. He will give recompense to them for their allegations. Truly, He is Wise, Knowing
They, surely, lost those who foolishly kill their children without knowledge. They forbade what God provided them in a devising against God. They, surely, went astray and had not been ones who are truly guided
And it is He Who caused gardens to grow, trellised and without being trellised and the date palm trees and a variety of harvest crops and the olives and the pomegranates resembling and not resembling one another. Eat of its fruit when it bore fruit and give its due on the day of its reaping and exceed not all bounds. Truly, He loves not the ones who are excessive
And of the flocks are some as beasts of burden and some for slaughter. Eat of what God provided you and follow not in the steps of Satan. Truly, he is a clear enemy to you
Eight diverse pairs; two of sheep and two of goats. Say: Forbade He the two males or the two females? Or what is contained in the wombs of the two females? Tell me with knowledge if you had been ones who are sincere
And of the camels two and of cows two, say: Forbade He the two males or the two females or what is contained in the wombs of the two females? Had you been witnesses when God charged you with this? Then, who does greater wrong than he who devised a lie against God to cause humanity to go astray without knowledge. Truly, God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust
Say: I find not in what was revealed to me to taste that which is forbidden to taste, but that it be carrion or blood, that which is shed or the flesh of swine for that, truly, is a disgrace or was hallowed—contrary to moral law—to other than God on it. Then, whoever was driven by necessity other than being one who is willfully disobedient or one who turns away. Then, truly, thy Lord is Forgiving, Compassionate
And to those who became Jews, We forbade every possessor of claws. And of the cows and the herd of sheep, We forbade them their fat, but what their backs carried or entrails or what mingled with bone. Thus, we gave them recompense for their insolence and We are, truly, ones who are sincere
If they denied thee, say: Your Lord is the Possessor of Extensive Mercy. And His might is not repelled from the folk, ones who sin
Those who ascribed partners with God will say: If God willed, neither would we have ascribed partners with God, nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything. Thus, denied those who were before them until they experienced Our might. Say: Is there any knowledge with you that you bring out to us? You follow not but opinion and, then, you only guess
Say: God has the conclusive disputation. And if He willed, He would have guided you one and all
Say: Come on! Bring your witnesses who bear witness that God forbade this. Then, if they bore witness, bear you not witness with them. And follow thee not the desires of those who denied Our signs and those who believe not in the world to come and they equate others with their Lord
Say: Approach now. I will recount what your Lord forbade you Ascribe nothing as partners with Him. And show kindness to the ones who are your parents. And kill not your children from want. We will provide for you and for them. And come not near any indecencies whether these were manifest or what was inward. And kill not a soul which God forbade, unless rightfully. He charged you with that so that perhaps you will be reasonable
And come not near the property of the orphan but with what is fairer until one reaches the coming of age. And live up to the full measure and balance with equity. We will not place a burden on any soul, but to its capacity. And when you said something, be just, even if it had been with possessors of kinship and live up to the compact of God. Thus, He charged you with it so that perhaps you will recollect
And that this is My straight path, so follow it. And follow not the ways that will split you up from His way. He charged you this with it, so that perhaps you will be Godfearing
Again, We gave Moses the Book rendered complete for him who did good, a decisive explanation of all things and as a guidance and mercy, so that perhaps they will believe in the meeting with their Lord
And this Book We caused to descend is that which is blessed so follow it and be Godfearing so that perhaps you will find mercy
so that you not say: The Book was only caused to descend to two sections before us. And, truly, we had been ones who are heedless of their study
Or so that you not say: If the Book was caused to descend to us, we would have been better guided than they. Surely, there drew near you clear portents from your Lord and a guidance and a mercy. And who, then, does greater wrong than he who denied the signs of God and drew aside from them. We will give recompense to those who draw aside from Our signs with a dire punishment because they had been drawing aside
Look they on only that the angels approach them? Or thy Lord approach them? Or some signs of thy Lord approach them? On a Day that approach some signs of thy Lord, belief will not profit a person if he believed not before, nor earned good because of his belief. Say: Wait awhile! We too are ones who are waiting awhile
Truly, those who separated and divided their way of life and had been partisans, be thou not concerned with them at all. Truly, their affair is only with God. Again, He will tell them what they had been accomplishing
Whoever drew near with benevolence, then, for him, ten times the like of it. And whoever drew near with an evil deed, then, recompense will not be given but with its like and they, they will not be wronged
Say: Truly, my Lord guided me to a straight path, a truth-loving way of life, the creed of Abraham, the monotheist. And he had not been of the ones who are polytheists
Say: Truly, my formal prayer and my ritual sacrifice and my living and my dying are for God, Lord of all the worlds
No associates are to be ascribed with Him and of this was I commanded and I am the first of the ones who submit to God
Say: Is it other than God that I should desire as a lord while He is Lord of everything? And each soul will earn only for itself. No burdened soul will bear another’s heavy load. Again, to your Lord will you return. Then, He will tell you about what you had been at variance in it
And it is He who made you as viceregents on the earth and exalted some of you above some others in degree that He try you with what He gave you. Truly, thy Lord is Swift in repayment and He, truly, is Forgiving, Compassionate
Alif L[m M\m @[d]
It is a Book that was caused to descend to thee. So let there be no impediment in thy breast about it so that thou wilt warn with it and as a reminder to the ones who believe
Follow what was caused to descend to you from your Lord and follow not protectors other than He. Little you recollect
And how many towns We caused to perish! And Our might drew near them at night or when they were ones who sleep at noon
Then, there had been no calling out when Our might drew near to them, but that they said: Truly, we had been ones who are unjust
Then, We will, certainly, ask those to whom were sent Messengers to them and We will, certainly, ask the ones who are sent
Then, We will relate to them with knowledge for We had never been of ones who are absent
The weighing of deeds on that Day will be The Truth. So ones whose balance was heavy from good deeds, then, those, they are the ones who prosper
And ones whose balance was made light from bad deeds those are those who have lost their souls because they had been doing wrong with Our signs
And, certainly, We established you firmly on the earth and We made for you in it a livelihood. But little you give thanks
And, certainly, We created you. Again, We formed you. Again, We said to the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam! Then, they prostrated themselves, but Iblis. He would not be of the ones who prostrate themselves
He said: What prevented thee from prostrating thyself when I commanded thee? Satan said: I am better than he. Thou hadst created me of fire and Thou hadst created him of clay
He said: So get thee down from this! It will not be for thee to increase in pride in it. Then, thou go forth. Truly, thou art of the ones who are disgraced
Satan said: Give me respite until the Day they are raised up
He said: Truly, thou art among the ones who are given respite
Satan said: Because Thou hadst led me into error, certainly, I will sit in ambush for them on Thy path, one that is straight
Again, I will approach them from between the front of them and from behind them and from their right and from their left. And Thou wilt not find many of them ones who are thankful
He said: Go thou forth from this—one who is scorned, one who is rejected. Whoever heeded thee among them, I will, certainly, fill hell with you, one and all
And: O Adam! Inhabit thou and thy spouse the Garden and both eat from where you both willed, but neither of you come near this tree or you both will be of the ones who are unjust
And Satan whispered evil to them both to show them both what was kept secret from them both—their intimate parts. And he said: The Lord of both of you prohibited you both from this tree so that neither of you be angels nor be ones who will dwell forever
And he swore an oath to them both that I am the one who gives advice to both of you
Then, he led both of them on to delusion. Then, when they both experienced of the tree, the intimate parts of both showed to both themselves and both of them took to doing stitching together over both from the leaves of the Garden. And the Lord of both of them proclaimed to them: Prohibited I not both of you from that tree? And said I not to both of you: Truly, Satan is a clear enemy of you both
They both said: Our Lord! We did wrong to ourselves. And if Thou wilt not forgive us and have mercy on us, we will, certainly, be among the ones who are losers
He said: Get you down, some of you an enemy to some other. And for you on the earth an appointed time and enjoyment for awhile
He said: You will live in it and you will die in it and from it you will be brought out
O Children of Adam! Surely, We caused to descend to you garments to cover up your intimate parts and finery, but the garment of God-consciousness, that is better. That is of the signs of God so that perhaps they will recollect
O Children of Adam! Let not Satan tempt you as he drove your parents out of the Garden, tearing off their garments from both of them to cause them to see their intimate parts. Truly, he and his type sees you whereas you see them not. Truly, We made he and the satans protectors of those who believe not
And when they committed an indecency, they said: We found our fathers on it and God commanded us in it. Say: Truly, God commands not depravities. Say you about God what you know not
Say: My Lord commanded me to equity. And set your faces at every place of prostration and call to Him ones who are sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him. As He began you, you will revert to Him
He guided a group of people and a group of people realized their fallacy. Truly, they took satans to themselves as protectors instead of God and they assume that they are ones who are truly guided
O Children of Adam! Take your adornment at every place of prostration. And eat and drink, but exceed not all bounds. Truly, He loves not the ones who are excessive
Say: Who forbade the adornment of God that He brought out for His servants. And what is the good of His provision? Say: They are for those who believed in this present life and, exclusively, on the Day of Resurrection. Thus, We explain distinctly the signs for a folk who know
Say: My Lord forbade not but indecencies—what was manifest or what was inward—and sins and unrightful insolence, to ascribe partners with God when He sends not down for it any authority and that you say about God what you know not
And for every community there is a term. And when their term drew near, they will not delay it by an hour, nor press it forward
O Children of Adam! If Messengers from among you approach relating My signs to you, then, whoever was Godfearing and made things right, then, there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse
But those who denied Our signs and grew arrogant against them, those are the Companions of the Fire; they are ones who will dwell in it forever
Then, who does greater wrong than he who devised a lie against God or denied His signs? Those, they will attain their share from the Book. Until Our Messengers drew near to gather them to themselves, they will say: Where are who you had been calling on other than God? They will say: They went astray from us. And they bore witness against themselves that, truly, they had been ones who are ungrateful
He will say: Enter among the communities that passed away before you of jinn and humankind into the fire. Every time a community entered, it would curse its sister community until when they will come successively in it altogether. The last of them would say to the first of them: Our Lord! These caused us to go astray so give them a double punishment of the fire. He will say: For everyone it is double except you know not
And the first of them would say to the last of them: You have had no superiority over us so experience the punishment for what you had been earning
Truly, those who denied Our signs and grew arrogant among them, the doors of heaven will not be opened up to them nor will they enter the Garden until a he-camel penetrates through the eye of the needle. And, thus, We give recompense to the ones who sin
For them hell will be their cradling and above them, the overwhelming event. Thus, We give recompense to the ones who are unjust
But for those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, We place no burden on any soul beyond its capacity. Those will be the Companions of the Garden. They are ones who will dwell in it forever
And We will draw out what was in their breasts of grudges. And rivers will run beneath them. And they will say: The Praise belongs to God Who truly guided us to this! And we would not have been guided if God guided us not. Certainly, the Messengers of our Lord drew near us with The Truth. And it was proclaimed to them that this, the Garden, was given to you as inheritance for what you had been doing
And the Companions of the Garden would cry out to the Companions of the Fire: Surely, we found what our Lord promised us to be true. Found you not what your Lord promised to be true? They would say: Yes. Then, it will be announced by one who announces among them: May the curse of God be on the ones who are unjust
those who bar the way of God and who desire it to be crooked. And in the world to come they will be ones who are ungrateful
And between them both is a partition. And on the Elevated Places will be men who recognize everyone by their mark. And they will cry out to the Companions of the Garden that: Peace be on you. They enter it not and they are desirous of it
And when their sight would be turned away of its own accord to the Companions of the Fire, they will say: Our Lord assign Thou us not with the folk, ones who are unjust
The Companions of the Elevated Places would cry out to men whom they would recognize by their mark. They would say: Your amassing availed you not, nor that you had been growing arrogant
Are these, those about whom you swore an oath that God would never impart mercy? Enter the Garden. There will be neither fear in you nor will you feel remorse
And the Companions of the Fire would cry out to the Companions of the Garden: Pour some water on us, or some of what God provided you. They would say: Truly, God forbade them both to the ones who are ungrateful
those who took their way of life to themselves as a diversion and as a pastime. This present life deluded them. So today We will forget them as they forgot the meeting of this their Day and because they had been negating Our signs
And, surely, We brought about a Book to them in which We explained distinctly, with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy for a folk who believe
Did they look on for nothing but its interpretation? The Day its interpretation approaches, those who forgot it before will say: Surely, Messengers of our Lord drew near us with The Truth. Have we any intercessors who will intercede for us? Or will we be returned so we do other than what we had been doing before? Surely, they lost themselves. Went astray from them what they had been devising
Truly, your Lord is God, He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days. Again, He turned His attention to the Throne. He covers the nighttime with the daytime that seeks it out urgently. And the sun and the moon and the stars are ones caused to be subservient to His command. Truly, His is not but the creation and the command. Blessed be God, Lord of the worlds
Call to your Lord humbly and inwardly. Truly, He loves not the ones who exceed the limits
Make not corruption in the earth after things were made right and call to Him with fear and hope. Truly, the mercy of God is Near to the ones who are doers of good
And it is He Who sends the winds, ones that are bearers of good news before His mercy until when they were charged with heavy clouds. We will drive it to a dead land. Then, We caused water to descend from the cloud and with it We bring out by water all kinds of fruits. Thus, We bring out the dead so that perhaps you will recollect
As for the good land, its plants go forth with permission of its Lord. While, as for what was bad, it goes forth not but scantily. Thus, We diversify the signs for a folk who give thanks
Surely, We sent Noah to his folk. And he said: O my folk! Worship God! You have no god other than He. Truly, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day
The Council of his folk said: Truly, we see thee clearly wandering astray
He said: O my folk! There is no fallacy in me. I am only a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds
I state the messages of my Lord to you and advise you and I know from God what you know not
Or marveled you that there drew near you a remembrance from your Lord through a man among you that he warn you and that you be Godfearing so that perhaps you will find mercy
Then, they denied him. Then, We rescued him and those who were with him on the boat and We drowned those who denied Our signs. Truly, they, they had been a folk in the dark
And to Ad, God sent their brother Hud. He said: O my folk! Worship God. You have no god but He. Will you not, then, be Godfearing
The Council of those who were ungrateful said among his folk: Truly, we see foolishness in thee. And, truly, we think that thou art among the ones who lie
He said: O my folk! There is no foolishness in me. I am only a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds
I state the messages of my Lord to you and I am one who gives advice to you, trustworthy
Or marveled you that there drew near you a remembrance from your Lord through a man from among you that he may warn you? And remember when He made you viceregents after the folk of Noah and increased you greatly in constitution? Then, remember the benefits of God so that perhaps you will prosper
They said: Hast thou brought about to us that we should worship God alone and forsake what our fathers had been worshipping? So approach us with what thou hast promised us if thou hadst been among the ones who are sincere
He said: Surely, fell on you disgrace and anger from your Lord. Dispute you with me over names which you named, you and your fathers, for which God sent not down any authority? Then, wait awhile. Truly, I will be with you among the ones who are waiting awhile
Then, We rescued him and those with him by a mercy from Us. And We severed the last remnant of those who denied Our signs. And they had not been ones who believe
And to Thamud God sent their brother Salih. He said: O my folk! Worship God! You have no god but He. Surely, drew near you clear portents from your Lord. This is the she-camel of God as a sign so allow her to eat on the earth of God and afflict her not with evil so a painful punishment not take you
And remember when He made you viceregents after Ad and placed you on the earth. You take to yourselves palaces on the plains and carve out the mountains as houses. So remember the benefits of God. And do no mischief as ones who make corruption in and on the earth
Said the Council of those who grew arrogant among his folk to those who were taken advantage of due to their weakness, to those who believed among them: Know you that Salih is one who is sent from his Lord? They said: Truly, in what he was sent, we are ones who believe
Those who grew arrogant said: Truly, we are in what you believed, ones who disbelieve
Then, they crippled the she-camel and defied the command of their Lord and they said: O Salih! Approach us with what thou hast promised us if thou hadst been among the ones who are sent
So the quaking of the earth took them. And it came to be in the morning they were in their abodes ones who are fallen prostrate
Then, he turned away from them and said: O my folk! Certainly, I expressed to you the message of my Lord and advised you, except you love not the ones who give advice
And mention Lot, when he said to his folk: You approach indecency as preceded you not anyone therein in the worlds
Truly, you, you approach men with lust instead of women? Nay! You are a folk, ones who are excessive
And the answer of his folk had not been but that they said: Bring them out from your town. Truly, they are a clan to cleanse themselves
Then, We rescued him and his people, but his woman. She had been among the ones who stay behind
And We rained down a rain on them. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who sin
And to Midian God sent their brother Shuayb. He said: O my folk! Worship God! You have no god other than He. Surely, a clear portent drew near you from your Lord so live up to the full measure and the balance and diminish not the things of humanity nor make corruption in and on the earth after things were made right. That will be better for you if you had been ones who believe
And sit not by every path intimidating and barring from the way of God those who believed in Him and you desire it to be crooked. And remember when you had been few and He augmented you. And look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who make corruption
And if there had been a section of you who believed in what I was sent with and a section believe not, have patience until God gives judgment between us. And He is Best of the ones who judge
Said the Council of those who grew arrogant from among his folk: O Shuayb! We will, certainly, drive thee out—and those who believed with thee—from our town or else you revert to our creed. He said: Even if we had been ones who dislike it
Surely, we would have devised a lie against God if we reverted to your creed after God delivered us from it. And it will not be for us that we revert to it unless God, our Lord, wills. Our Lord encompassed everything in knowledge. In God we put our trust. Our Lord! Give victory between us and between our folk in Truth and Thou art Best of the ones who are deliverers
But said the Council of those who were ungrateful among his folk: If you followed Shuayb, then, truly, you will be ones who are losers
Then, the quaking of the earth took them and they came to be in the morning ones who are fallen prostrate in their abodes
Those who denied Shuayb had been as if they had not dwelt in them. Those who denied Shuayb they, they had been the ones who were losers
So he turned away from them and said: O my folk! Certainly, I expressed to you the messages of my Lord and I advised you. Then, how should I grieve for a folk, ones who are ungrateful
And We sent not any Prophet to a town, but We took its people with tribulation and desolation so that perhaps they will lower themselves
Again, We substituted in place of evil deeds, benevolence, until they exceeded in number and they said: Surely, our fathers were touched by tribulation and gladness. Then, We took them suddenly while they are not aware
And if the people of the towns believed and were Godfearing, We would have opened blessings for them from the heaven and the earth, except they denied. So We took them for what they had been earning
Were, then, the people of the towns safe when Our might approaches them at night while they are ones who sleep
Or were the people of the towns safe when Our might approaches them in the forenoon while they play
Were they safe from the planning of God? No one deems himself safe from the planning of God but the folk, the ones who are losers
Guides not those who inherit the earth after its previous people that if We will, We would light on them for their impieties, and We set a seal on their hearts so they hear not
These are the towns. Their tidings We relate to thee. And, certainly, their Messengers drew near them with the clear portents. But they had not been believing in what they denied before. Thus, God set a seal on the hearts of the ones who are ungrateful
And We found not in many of them any compact. And, truly, We found many of them are ones who disobey
Again, We raised up Moses after them with Our signs to Pharaoh and his Council, but they did wrong to them. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who make corruption
And Moses said: O Pharaoh! Truly, I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds
I am approved on condition that I say nothing but The Truth about God. Surely, I drew near you with a clear portent from your Lord. So send the Children of Israel with me
Pharaoh said: If thou hadst been drawing near with a sign, then, approach with it if thou hadst been among the ones who are sincere
Then, Moses cast his staff. That is when it became a clear serpent
And he drew out his hand. That is when it was shimmering white to the ones who look
The Council of the folk of Pharaoh said: Truly, this is a knowing sorcerer
He wants to drive you out from your region so what is your command
They said: Put him and his brother off and send to the cities to the place where ones who assemble are
Let them approach thee with every knowing sorcerer
And the ones who are sorcerers drew near to Pharaoh. They said: Truly, would we have compensation if we had been the ones who are victors
Pharaoh said: Yes! And, truly, you will be of the ones who are brought near to me
They said: O Moses! Either thou cast, or will we be the ones who cast
He said: You cast. So when they cast, they cast a spell on the eyes of the personages and terrified them. And a tremendous sorcery drew near
And We revealed to Moses that: Cast thy staff. That is when it swallowed what they faked
Thus, The Truth came to pass and proved false what they had been doing
So they were vanquished there and turned about as ones who are disgraced
The ones who are sorcerers were made to fall down as ones who prostrate themselves
They said: We believed in the Lord of the worlds
the Lord of Moses and Aaron
Pharaoh said: You believed in Him before I give permission to you. Truly, this is a plan you planned in the city that you drive out the people from it but you will know
I will, certainly, cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides. Again, I will cause you to be crucified, one and all
They said: Truly, we are ones who are turning to our Lord
Thou hast sought revenge on us only because we believed in the signs of our Lord when they drew near us. Our Lord! Pour out patience on us and call us to Thyself as ones who submit to God
And the Council of the folk of Pharaoh said: Wilt thou forsake Moses and his folk to make corruption in and on the earth while they forsake thee and thy gods? Pharaoh said: We will slay their children and we will save alive their women. And truly, we are ones who are ascendant over them
Moses said to his folk: Pray for help from God and have patience. Truly, the earth belongs to God. He gives it as inheritance to whom He wills of His servants. And that is the Ultimate End for the ones who are Godfearing
They said: We were maligned before thou hast approached us and after thou hast drawn near to us. He said: Perhaps your Lord will cause your enemy to perish and make you successors to him on the earth so that He will look on how you do
And, certainly, We took the people of Pharaoh with years of diminution of fruits, so that perhaps they will recollect
And when benevolence drew near them, they would say: This belongs to us. But if an evil deed lights on them, they augur ill of Moses and who were with him. Certainly, that which are their omens are with God except most of them know not
And they said: Whatever sign thou hast brought to us to cast a spell on us with it, we will not be ones who believe in thee
Then, We sent on them the deluge and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and blood as distinct signs, but they grew arrogant and they had been a folk, ones who sin
And when the wrath fell on them, they said: O Moses! Call to thy Lord for us because of the compact made with thee. If thou wert to remove the wrath from us, we would, certainly, believe in thee. And we will send the Children of Israel with thee
But when We removed the wrath from them for a term, that which is conclusive, they break their oath
So We requited them and drowned them in the water of the sea because they denied Our signs and they had been ones who are heedless of them
And We gave as inheritance to the folk who had been taken advantage of due to their weakness, the east of the region and its west which We blessed. And completed was the fairer Word of thy Lord for the Children of Israel because they endured patiently. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his folk had been crafting and what they had been constructing
And We brought the Children of Israel over the sea. Then, they approached on a folk who give themselves up to their idols. They said: O Moses! Make for us a god like the gods they have. He said: Truly, you are an ignorant folk
Truly, these are the ones who are ruined and falsehood is what they had been doing
He said: Should I look for any god other than God for you while He gave you an advantage over the worlds
Mention when We rescued you from the people of Pharaoh who cause an affliction to befall you of a dire punishment. They slay your children and save alive your women. And in that was a trial for you from your Lord, tremendous
And We appointed thirty nights for Moses. And We completed them with ten more. Thus, fulfilled was the time appointed by his Lord of forty nights. And Moses said to his brother, Aaron: Be my successor among my folk and make things right and follow not the way of the ones who make corruption
And when Moses drew near Our time appointed and his Lord spoke to him, he said: O my Lord! Cause me to see that I look on Thee. He said: Thou wilt never see Me but look on the mountain. Then, if it stayed fast in its place, then, thou wilt see Me. Then, when his Lord Self-disclosed to the mountain, He made it as ground powder and Moses fell down swooning. And when he recovered he said: Glory be to Thee! I repented to Thee and I am the first of the ones who believe
He said: O Moses! Truly, I favored thee above humanity by My messages and by My assertion. So take what I gave thee and be among the ones who are thankful
And We wrote down for him on the Tablets something of all things and an admonishment and a decisive explanation of all things. So take these with firmness and command thy folk to take what is fairer. I will cause you to see the abodes of the ones who disobey
I will turn away from My signs those who increase in pride on the earth without right. And if they see every sign, they believe not in it. And if they see the way of right judgment, yet they will not take that way to themselves. But if they see the way of error, they will take themselves to that way. That is because they denied Our signs and had been ones who are heedless of them
And as for those who denied Our signs and the meeting in the world to come, their actions were fruitless. Will they be given recompense but for what they had been doing
And the folk of Moses took to themselves after him from out of their glitter a calf, a lifeless body like one that has the lowing sound of flocks. See they not that it neither speaks to them nor guides them to a Way?• Yet they took it to themselves. And they had been the ones who are unjust
And when they became ones who are remorseful and saw that they, surely, went astray, they said: If our Lord not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will, certainly, be among the ones who are losers
And when Moses returned to his folk enraged, grieved, he said: Miserable was what you succeeded in after me. Would you hasten the command of your Lord? And he cast down the Tablets. He took his brother by his head, pulling him to himself. Aaron said: O son of my mother, truly, the folk took advantage of my weakness and are about to kill me. So let not my enemies gloat over me and assign me not with the folk, the ones who are unjust
Moses said: Lord! Forgive me and my brother and cause us to enter into Thy mercy for Thou art One Who is Most Merciful of the ones who are merciful
Those who took the calf to themselves attain anger from their Lord and abasement in this present life. And, thus, We give recompense to the ones who devise
But those who did evil deeds and repented and, again, believed, truly, thy Lord, after that, will be Forgiving, Compassionate
And when the anger subsided in Moses, he took the Tablets. There was guidance and mercy in their inscription for those, they who have reverence for their Lord
And Moses chose of his folk seventy men for Our time appointed. And when the quaking of the earth took them, he said: Lord! If Thou wilt, Thou wouldst cause them to perish and me before. Wouldst Thou cause us to perish for what the foolish among us accomplished? It is not but Thy test. With it Thou wilt cause to go astray whom Thou wilt and Thou wilt guide whom Thou hadst willed. Thou art our protector, so forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of the ones who forgive
And prescribe for us in the present benevolence and in the world to come. Truly we turned back to Thee. He said: I light My punishment on whom I will and My mercy encompassed everything. Then, I will prescribe it for those who are Godfearing and give the purifying alms and those, they who believe in Our signs
those who follow the Messenger—the unlettered Prophet—whom they will find with them that which is a writing in the Torah and the Gospel. He commands them to that which is honorable and prohibits them from that which is unlawful. And He permits to them what is good and forbids them from deeds of corruption. And He lays down for them severe tests, and the yokes that had been on them. So those who believed in him and supported him and helped him and followed the light that was caused to descend to him, those, they are the ones who prosper
Say: O humanity! Truly, I am the Messenger of God to you all of Him to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He gives life and He causes to die. So believe in God and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in God and His words and follow him so that perhaps you will be truly guided
And among the folk of Moses there is a community that guides with The Truth and by it is just
And We sundered them into twelve tribes as communities. And We revealed to Moses when his folk asked him for water: Strike the rock with thy staff. Then, burst forth out of it twelve springs: Surely, each clan knew its drinking place. And We shaded them with cloud shadows. We caused to descend manna and the quails for them. Eat of what is good that We provided you! And they did not wrong Us, but they had been doing wrong to themselves
And mention when it was said to them: Inhabit this town and eat from it wherever you willed. Say: Unburden us of sin! And enter the door as ones who prostrate themselves We will forgive you your transgressions. We will increase the ones who are doers of good
But among those who did wrong, they substituted a saying other than what was said to them. Then, We sent wrath from heaven because they had been doing wrong
And ask them about the town—that which had been bordering the sea— when they disregarded the Sabbath, when their great fish would approach them on the day of the Sabbath, one that was visible on the shore. And the day they keep not the Sabbath, they approach them not. Thus, We try them because they had been disobeying
And mention when a community of them said: Why admonish a folk whom God is One Who Causes them to Perish or One Who Punishes them with a severe punishment. They said: To be free from guilt before your Lord and so that perhaps they will be Godfearing
So when they forgot of what they were reminded, We rescued those who prohibited evil and We took those who did wrong with a terrifying punishment because they had been disobeying
Then, when they defied what they were prohibited We said to them: Be you apes, ones who are driven away
And mention when thy Lord caused to be proclaimed that He would, surely, raise up against them until the Day of Resurrection who cause an affliction to befall on them of a dire punishment. Truly, thy Lord is Swift in repayment. And, truly, He is Forgiving, Compassionate
And We sundered them in the region into communities. Some of them were the ones in accord with morality and others were other than that. And We tried them with benevolence and evil deeds so that perhaps they will return to obedience
Then, after that succeeded successors who inherited the Book. They take advantage of this nearer world, and they say: We will be forgiven. And if an advantage approaches them like it, they will take it. Is not a solemn promise taken from them with the Book that they would say about God only The Truth? And studied they not what is in it, and know that the Last Abode is better for those who are Godfearing? Will you not, then, be reasonable
And those who keep fast to the Book and performed the formal prayer, We will not waste the compensation of the ones who make things right
Mention when We shook up the mountain over them, as if it had been an overshadowing, and they thought it was that which would fall on them: It was said: Take with firmness what We gave you and remember what is in it so that perhaps you will be Godfearing
And mention when thy Lord took from the Children of Adam—from their generative organs—their offspring and called to them to witness of themselves: Am I not your Lord? They said: Yea! ^We bore witness^ so that you say not on the Day of Resurrection: Truly, we had been ones who were heedless of this
Or you not say: Our fathers before us ascribed partners with God. We had been offspring after them. Wilt Thou cause us to perish for what the ones who deal in falsehood accomplished
And, thus, We explain Our signs distinctly so that perhaps they will return
And recount to them the tiding of him to whom We gave Our signs, but he cast himself off from them. So Satan pursued him then, he had been among the ones who are in error
And if We willed, We would have exalted him with them, but he inclined towards the earth, and followed his own desires. And his parable is like the parable of a dog. If thou wilt attack it, it pants. Or if thou wilt leave it, it pants. That is the parable of the folk, those who denied Our signs. Then, relate these narratives so that perhaps they will reflect
How evil is the parable of the folk who denied Our signs! And they had been doing wrong to themselves
Whomever God guides, then, he is one who is truly guided. And whomever He causes to go astray, then, those, they are the ones who are losers
And, certainly, We made numerous for hell many of the jinn and humankind. They have hearts with which they understand not. And they have eyes with which they perceive not. And they have ears with which they hear not. Those are like flocks. Nay! They are ones who go astray. Those, they are the ones who are heedless
To God belongs the Fairer Names, so call to Him by them. And forsake those who blaspheme His Names. They will be given recompense for what they had been doing
And of whom We created there is a community that guides with The Truth, and with it, it is just
And those who denied Our signs, We will draw them on gradually from where they will not know
And I will grant them indulgence for a while. Truly, My strategizing is sure
Reflect they not? There is no madness in their companion. He is but a clear warner
Expect they not in the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever things God created that perhaps their term be near? Then, in which discourse after this will they believe
Whomever God causes to go astray then, there is no one who guides him. And He forsakes them in their defiance, wandering unwilling to see
They ask thee about the Hour, when will it berth? Say: The knowledge of that is only with my Lord. None will display its time but He. It was heavy, hidden in the heavens and the earth. It will approach you not but suddenly. They will ask thee as if thou hadst been one who is well-informed about it. Say: The knowledge of that is only with God, but most of humanity knows not
Say: I rule not over myself either for profit or for hurt, but what God willed. And if the unseen had been known to me, I would have acquired much good and evil would not have afflicted me. I am but a warner and a bearer of good tidings to a folk who believe
It is He Who created you from a single soul. And out of it made its spouse that he rest in her. And when he laid over her, she carried a light burden and moved about with it. But when she was weighed down, they both called to God their Lord saying: If Thou wouldst give us one in accord with morality, we will certainly be among the ones who are thankful
Then, when He gave them both one in accord with morality, they made ascribed associates with Him in what He gave them both. God was Exalted above partners they ascribe
Ascribe they partners with God who create nothing and are themselves created
And they are not able to help them nor help themselves
And if you call them to the guidance, they will not follow you. It is equal whether you called to them or you be ones who remain quiet
Truly, those whom you call to other than God are servants like you. So call to them and let them respond to you if you had been ones who are sincere
Have they feet by which they walk? Or have they hands by which they seize by force? Or have they eyes by which they perceive? Or have they ears by which they hear? Say: Call you to your ascribed associates. Again, try to outwit me and give me no respite
Truly, God is my protector, Who sent down the Book. And He takes into His protection the ones in accord with morality
And those whom you call to other than Him, they are not able to help you, nor are they able to help themselves
And if you call them to the guidance, they hear not. Thou hast seen them look on thee, but they perceive not
Take the extra and command what is honorable. And turn aside from the ones who are ignorant
But if enmity is sown by Satan in thee, sowing enmity, then, seek refuge in God. Truly, He is Hearing, Knowing
Truly, those who were Godfearing when they were touched by a visitation from Satan, they recollected. That is when they were ones who perceive
And their brothers/sisters cause them to increase in error, and, again, they never stop short
When thou hast not approached them with a sign, they said: Why hadst thou not improvised one? Say: I follow only what is revealed to me from my Lord. This is clear evidence from your Lord and guidance and mercy for a folk who believe
And when the Quran was recited, listen and pay heed so that perhaps you will find mercy
And remember thy Lord in thyself humbly and with awe instead of openly publishing the sayings at the first part of the day and the eventide. And be thou not among the ones who are heedless
Truly, those who are with thy Lord grow not arrogant from His worship. And they glorify Him and they prostrate themselves to Him.‡
They ask thee about the spoils of war. Say: The spoils of war belong to God and the Messenger so be Godfearing of God and make things right among you and obey God and his Messenger if you had been ones who believe
The ones who believe are only those whose hearts took notice when God was remembered. When His signs were recounted to them, their belief increased and they put their trust in the Lord—
those who perform the formal prayer and spend out of what We provided them
those, they are the ones who truthfully believe. For them are degrees with their Lord and forgiveness and generous provision
Just as thy Lord brought thee out from thy house with The Truth, and, truly, a group of people among the ones who believe were the ones who dislike it
They dispute with thee about The Truth—after it became clear—as if they had been driven to death and they look on at it
And when God promises you, one of the two sections: It will, truly, be for you. And you wish that the one that is unarmed should be yours. And God wants that He verify The Truth by His Words and to sever the last remnant of the ones who are ungrateful
that He may verify The Truth and render the falsehood untrue even if the ones who sin disliked it
Mention when you cry for help from your Lord and He responded to you: Truly, I am One Who Reinforces you with a thousand angels, ones who come one after another
And did God make this as good tidings for you so that with it your hearts will be at rest in it? And there is no help but from God alone. Truly, God is Almighty, Wise
Mention when a sleepiness enwraps you as a safety from Him. He sends down water from heaven for you and He purifies you by it and causes to be put away from you the defilement of Satan. He invigorates your hearts and makes your feet firm by it
Mention when thy Lord reveals to the angels: I am, truly, with you, so make those who believed firm. I will cast alarm into the hearts of those who were ungrateful. So strike above their necks and strike each of their fingers from them
That is because they made a breach with God and His Messenger. And to whomever makes a breach with God and His Messenger, then, truly, God is Severe in repayment
That is for you, so experience it, and, truly, for the ones who are ungrateful, the punishment of the fire
O those who believed! When you met those who were ungrateful marching to battle, then, turn not your backs to them in flight
And whoever turns his back that Day—but one who withdraws from fighting for a purpose—or one who moves aside to another faction, he, surely, drew the burden of the anger from God and his place of shelter will be hell. And miserable will be the Homecoming
Then, you kill them not, but God killed them. And thou hadst not thrown when thou hadst thrown but God threw. He tries by experiment the ones who believe with a fairer trial from Him. Truly, God is Hearing, Knowing
That is so, and, truly, God is One Who Makes Frail the cunning of the ones who are ungrateful
If you seek a judgment then, surely, drew near to you the victory. And if you refrain yourselves, then, that would be better for you. And if you revert, We will revert. And your factions will not avail you at all even if they were many. And God is with the ones who believe
O those who believed! Obey God and His Messenger and turn not away from him when you hear his command
And be not like those who said: We heard, when they hear not
Truly, the worst of moving creatures with God are unwilling to hear and unwilling to speak, those who are not reasonable
If God knew any good in them He would have caused them to be willing to hear. And even if He had caused them to be willing to hear, truly, they would have turned away, and they are ones who turn aside
O those who believed! Respond to God and to the Messenger when He called you to what gives you life. And know, truly, that God comes between a man and his heart and that to Him you will assemble
Be Godfearing of a test which will not light on those of you, particularly, who did wrong. And know that God is, truly, Severe in repayment
And remember when you were few, ones taken advantage of due to weakness on the earth. You fear humanity would snatch you away so He gave you refuge and confirmed you with His help and provided you with what is good so that perhaps you will give thanks
O those who believed! Betray not God and the Messenger nor betray your trusts when you know
And know that your wealth and your children are a test and that God, with Him is a sublime compensation
O those who believed! If you are Godfearing of God, He will assign you a Criterion between right and wrong and will absolve you of your evil deeds and will forgive you. And God is Possessor of Sublime Grace
And mention when those who were ungrateful plan against thee to bring thee to a standstill or to kill thee or to drive thee out. And they plan and God plans, but God is Best of the ones who plan
And when Our signs are recounted to them, they said: We heard this. If we will, we would say the like of this. Truly, this is only fables of ancient ones
And when they said: O God! Truly, if this had been The Truth from Thee, rain down rocks on us from heaven or bring us a painful punishment
But God had not been punishing them with thee among them. Nor had God been One Who Punishes them while they ask for forgiveness
And what is with them that God should not punish them while they bar worshipers from the Masjid al-Haram and they had not been its protectors? Truly, its protectors are but ones who are Godfearing except most of them know not
Their formal prayer at the House had been nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. So experience the punishment because you had been ungrateful
Truly, those who were ungrateful spend their wealth so that they bar the way of God. They will spend it. Again, it will become a regret for them. Again, they will be vanquished. And those who were ungrateful will be assembled in hell
God will differentiate the bad from what is good. And He will lay the bad, some on some other, and heap them up altogether and lay them into hell. Those, they are the ones who are losers
Say to those who were ungrateful: If they refrain themselves, what is past will be forgiven. And if they repeat then, surely, a custom passed of the ancient ones as a warning
And fight them until there be no persecution and the way of life—all of it—be for God. Then, if they refrained themselves, then, truly, God is Seeing of what they do
And if they turned away, then, know that God is your Defender. How excellent a Defender and how excellent a Helper
And know that whatever thing you gain as booty, then, truly one-fifth of it belongs to God and to the Messenger and to the possessors of kinship and the orphans and the needy and the traveler of the way. if you had been believing in God and in what We caused to descend to Our servant on the Day of the Criterion between right and wrong, the day when the two multitudes met one another. And God is Powerful over everything
Mention when you were on the nearer bank of the valley and they were on the farther bank of the valley and the cavalcade was below you. Even if you made a promise together, you would be, certainly, at variance as to the solemn declaration because God decrees a command that had been one that is accomplished so that he who perishes would have perished by a clear portent and he who lives would live on by a clear portent. And, truly, God is Hearing, Knowing
Mention when God causes thee to see them as few in thy slumbering. If He caused thee to see them as many, you would have lost heart and contended with one another about the command except God saved you. Truly, He is Knowing of what is in the breasts
And mention when He causes you to see them when you met one another as few in your eyes and He makes you few in their eyes so that God decrees a command that had been one that is accomplished. And commands are returned to God
O those who believed! When you met a faction, then, stand firm and remember God frequently so that perhaps you will prosper
And obey God and His Messenger and contend not with one another. Then, you lose heart and your competence go. And have patience. Truly, God is with the ones who remain steadfast
And be not like those who went forth from their abodes recklessly to show off to personages and bar them from the way of God. And God is One Who Encloses what they do
And mention when Satan made to appear pleasing their actions to them and said: No one will be ones who are victors against you this day from among all personages. And, truly, I will be your neighbor. But when the two factions sighted one another, he receded on his two heels and said: Truly, I am free of you. Truly, I see what you see not. Truly, I fear God. And God is Severe in repayment
Mention when the ones who are hypocrites say and those who, in their hearts, is a sickness: Their way of life deluded these, but whoever puts his trust in God. Then, truly, God is Almighty, Wise
And if thou wouldst see when those who were ungrateful are called to themselves by the angels, they are striking their faces and their backs saying: Experience the punishment of the burning
That is because of what your hands put forward of evil and, truly, God is not unjust to His servants
In like manner of the people of Pharaoh—and of those before them— they were ungrateful for the signs of God so God took them for their impieties. Truly, God is Strong, Severe in repayment
Know that God will never be One Who Causes to Alter a divine blessing when He was gracious to a folk unless they first alter what is within themselves. And, truly, God is Hearing, Knowing
In like manner of the people of Pharaoh, and those before them, they denied the signs of their Lord, so We caused them to perish for their impieties. And We drowned the people of Pharaoh. And they all had been ones who are unjust
Truly, the worst of moving creatures with God are those who were ungrateful, so they will not believe
Those with whom thou hast made a contract, again, they break their compact every time and they are not Godfearing
So if thou hast come upon them in war, then, break them up, whoever is behind them, so that perhaps they will recollect
And if thou hast feared treachery from a folk, then, dissolve the relationship with them equally. Truly, God loves not the ones who are traitors
Assume thou not that those who were ungrateful will outdo Me. Truly, they will never weaken Him
And prepare for them whatever you were able of strength, including a string of horses, to put fear in the enemy of God and your enemy and others besides whom you know them not. God knows them. And whatever thing you spend in the way of God, the account will be paid in full to you and you will not be wronged
And if they tended towards peace, then, tend thou towards it and put thy trust in God. Truly, He is The Hearing, The Knowing
And if they want to deceive thee, then, truly, God is Enough. It is He Who confirmed thee with His help and with the ones who believe
And He brought their hearts together. If thou hadst spent all that is in and on the earth, thou wouldst not have brought together their hearts, except God brought them together. Truly, He is Almighty, Wise
O Prophet! God is Enough for thee and for whoever followed thee among the ones who believe
O Prophet! Encourage fighting to the ones who believe. If there be twenty of you, ones who remain steadfast, they will vanquish two hundred. And if there be a hundred of you, they will vanquish a thousand of those who were ungrateful because they are a folk who understand not
Now God lightened your burden from you for He knew that there was a weakness in you. So if there would be a hundred of you, ones who remain steadfast, they will vanquish two hundred. And if there would be a thousand of you, they will vanquish two thousand with the permission of God. And God is with the ones who remain steadfast
It had not been for a Prophet that he would have prisoners of war unless he gives a sound thrashing in the region. You want the advantages of the present, but God wants the world to come. And God is Almighty, Wise
Were it not for a preceding prescription from God, you would, certainly, be afflicted with a tremendous punishment for what you took
Eat of what you gained as booty, lawful, what is good. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
O Prophet! Say to whom are in your hands of the prisoners of war: If God knows any good in your hearts, He will give you better than what was taken from you and He will forgive you. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
But if they want treachery against thee, they, surely, betrayed God before, so He gave thee power over them. And God is Knowing, Wise
Truly, those who believed and emigrated and struggled with their wealth and their lives in the way of God, and those who gave refuge and helped, those are protectors, some of some others. And those who believed, but emigrate not, you have no duty of friendship to them at all until they emigrate. And if they asked you for help in the way of life, then, it would be upon you to help them, but against the folk whom between you and between them there is a solemn promise. And God is Seeing of what you do
And those who were ungrateful, some are protectors of some others. If you accomplish not allying with other believers there will be persecution on the earth and the hateful sin of corruption
And those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of God and those who gave refuge and helped, those, they are the ones who truthfully believe. For them is forgiveness and generous provision
And those who believed afterwards, and emigrated and struggled beside you, then, those are of you. And those imbued through wombs, blood relations, some are more deserving than some others in what is prescribed by God, truly, God is Knowing of everything
God and His Messenger declare disassociation from those with whom you made a contract among the ones who were polytheists who violated it
Roam about on the earth for four months and know that you will not be ones who frustrate God and that God is One Who Covers with shame the ones who are ungrateful
And the announcement from God and His Messenger to humanity on the day of the greater pilgrimage to Makkah is that God is free from the ones who are polytheists and so is His Messenger. Then, it will be better for you if you repented. But if you turned away, then, know that you are not ones who frustrate God. And give thou tidings to those who were ungrateful of a painful punishment
But those with whom you made a contract—among the ones who are polytheists—and again, they reduce you not at all nor do they back anyone against you, then, fulfill their compact with them until their term of contract expires. Truly, God loves the ones who are Godfearing
When the months of pilgrim sanctity were drawn away, then, kill the ones who are polytheists wherever you found them and take them and besiege them and sit in every place of ambush. Then, if they repented and performed the formal prayer and gave the purifying alms, then, let them go their way. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
And if anyone of the ones who are polytheists sought asylum with thee, then, grant him protection so that he hears the assertions of God. Again, convey thou him to a place of safety. That is because they are a folk who know not
How will there be for the ones who are polytheists a compact with God and with His Messenger but for those with whom you made a contract near the Masjid al-Haram? If they go straight with you, then, go straight with them. Truly, God loves the ones who are Godfearing
How? And if they get the better of you, they regard not ties of relationship with you nor a pact? They please you with their mouths, but their hearts refuse compliance and many of them are ones who disobey
They sold out the signs of God for a little price and barred others from His way. Truly, how evil is what they had been doing
They regard not towards one who believes either ties of relationship or a pact. And those, they are the ones who exceed the limits
But if they repented and performed the formal prayer and gave the purifying alms, then, they are your brothers/sisters in your way of life, We explain the signs distinctly for a folk who know
But if they broke their sworn oaths after their compact and discredited your way of life, then, fight the leaders of ingratitude. Truly, they, their sworn oaths are nothing to them, so that perhaps they will refrain themselves
Will you not fight a folk who broke their sworn oaths and were about to expel the Messenger? Began they the first time against you? Will you dread them? God has a better right that you should dread Him if you had been ones who believe
Fight them! God will punish them by your hands and cover them with shame and help you against them. And He will heal the breasts of a folk, ones who believe
and He causes to be put away the rage in their hearts. And God turns to whom He wills in forgiveness. And God is Knowing, Wise
Or assumed you that you would be left before God knows those who struggled among you? And take not anyone to yourselves other than God and His Messenger and the ones who believe as intimate friends. And God is Aware of what you do
It had not been for the ones who are polytheists to frequent the places of prostration to God while they are ones who bear witness against themselves of their ingratitude. Those, their actions were fruitless. They are ones who will dwell in the fire forever
Only he frequents places of prostration to God who believed in God and the Last Day and performed the formal prayer and gave the purifying alms and dreads none but God. Perhaps those will be among the ones who are truly guided
Made you the giving of water to drink to the ones who are pilgrims and frequenting the Masjid al-Haram the same as he who believed in God and the Last Day and struggled in the way of God? They are not on the same level with God. And God guides not the folk, ones who are unjust
Those who believed and emigrated and struggled in the way of God with their wealth and their lives are sublime in their degree with God. And those, they are the ones who are victorious
Their Lord gives them good tidings of mercy from Him and His contentment and of Gardens for them in which is abiding bliss
They are ones who will dwell in them forever, eternally. Truly, God, with Him is a sublime compensation
O those who believed! Take not to yourselves your fathers and brothers/sisters as protectors if they embraced disbelief instead of belief. And whoever of you turns away to them, then, those, they are the ones who are unjust
Say: If had been your fathers and your children and your brothers/sisters and your spouses and your kinspeople and the wealth you gained and the transactions you dread slacken and the dwellings with which you are well-pleased were more beloved to you than God and His Messenger and struggling in His Way, then, await until God brings His command. And God guides not the folk, ones who disobey
God, certainly, helped you in many battlefields and on the day of Hunayn when you were impressed with your great numbers, but it avails you not at all. And the earth was narrow for you for all its breadth. Again, you turned as ones who draw back
Again, God caused His tranquility to descend on His Messenger and on the ones who believed and caused armies you see not to descend and punished those who were ungrateful. And this is the recompense of the ones who were ungrateful
Again, God will turn to whom He will in forgiveness after that. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
O those who believed! Truly, the ones who are polytheists are unclean, so let them come not near the Masjid al-Haram after this year. And if you feared being poverty-stricken, God will enrich you out of His grace if He willed. Truly, God is Knowing, Wise
Fight those who believe not in God nor the Last Day nor forbid what God and His Messenger forbade nor practice the way of life of The Truth among those who were given the Book until they give the tribute out of hand and they be ones who comply
And the Jews said: Ezra is the son of God and the Christians said: The Messiah is the son of God. That is the saying with their mouths. They conform with the sayings of those who were ungrateful before. God took the offensive. How they are misled
They took to themselves their learned Jewish scholars and their monks as lords—other than God—and the Messiah son of Mary. And they were only commanded to worship The One God. There is no god but He! Glory be to Him above the partners they ascribe
They want to extinguish the light of God with their mouths, but God refuses so that He fulfill His light even if the ones who are ungrateful disliked it
It is He Who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the way of life of The Truth so that He may uplift it over all ways of life, even if the ones who are polytheists disliked it
O those who believed! Truly, there are many of the learned Jewish scholars and monks who consume the wealth of humanity in falsehood and bar from the way of God and those who treasure up gold and silver and spend it not in the way of God. Give to them tidings of a painful punishment
on a Day it will be hot in the fire of hell. Then, by it are branded their foreheads and their sides and their backs. It will be said: This is what you treasured up for yourselves so experience what you had been treasuring up
Truly, the period of months with God is twelve lunar months in the Book of God. On the day when He created the heavens and the earth of them. Four are sanctified. That is the truth-loving way of life. So do not wrong yourselves in it. And fight the ones who are polytheists collectively, as they fight you collectively. And know that God is with the ones who are Godfearing
Truly, the postponing a Sacred Month is an increase in ingratitude. By it are caused to go astray those who were ungrateful, for they permit it a year, and forbid it a year, so that they agree with the period that God forbade, and they permit what God forbade. Made to appear pleasing to them was the evil of their actions. And God guides not the folk, the ones who are ungrateful
O those who believed! What was it with you when was said to you: Move forward in the way of God, you inclined heavily downwards to the earth? Were you so well-pleased with this present life instead of the world to come? But the enjoyment of this present life is not but little compared to the world to come
Unless you move forward, He will punish you with a painful punishment and will have in exchange for you a folk other than you. And you will not injure Him at all. And God is Powerful over everything
If you help him not, then, surely, God helped him when those who were ungrateful drove him out. The second of two, when they were both in the cavern, he says to his companion: Feel no remorse. Truly, God is with us. Then, God caused His tranquility to descend on him and confirmed him with armies that you see not and made the word of those who were ungrateful the lowest. And the Word of God is Lofty. God is Almighty, Wise
Move forward light and heavy and struggle with your wealth and your lives in the way of God. That is better for you if you had been knowing
If it had been a near advantage and an easy journey, they would have followed thee, except the destination of the journey was distant for them. And they will swear by God: If we were able, we would, certainly, have gone forth with you. They will cause themselves to perish. And God knows that they are the ones who lie
God pardon thee! Why hadst thou given permission to them before it becomes clear to thee those who were sincere and thou hast known who are the ones who lie
They ask not permission of thee, those who believe in God and the Last Day, that they struggle with their wealth and their lives. And God is Knowing of the ones who are Godfearing
It is only those who ask permission of thee who believe not in God and the Last Day and whose hearts were in doubt, so they go this way and that in their doubts
And if they wanted to go forth, certainly, they would have prepared for it some preparation, except God disliked arousing them, so He caused them to pause and it was said: Sit along with the ones who sit at home
If they went forth with you, they would have increased nothing for you, but ruination. And they would have rushed to and fro in your midst with insolent dissension. And among you are ones who would have harkened to them. And God is Knowing of the ones who are unjust
Certainly, they were looking for dissension before. And they turned around and around for thee the commands until The Truth drew near, and the command of God became manifest although they were ones who dislike it
Among them is he who says: Give me permission and tempt me not. But they descended into dissension. And, truly, hell is that which encloses the ones who are ungrateful
If lights on thee benevolence, they are raised to anger, but if an affliction lights on thee, they say: Surely, we took our commands before. And they turn away and they are glad
Say: Nothing will light on us but what God had been prescribing for us. He is our Defender. And in God let the ones who believe put their trust
Say: Are you watching for something, but one of the two fairer things to befall us? And we watch for you, whether God will light on you a punishment from Him or from our hands. So watch! We are ones who are waiting with you
Say: Spend willingly or unwillingly. There will be only non-acceptance. Truly, you, you had been a folk, ones who disobey
And nothing prevented their contributions being accepted from them but that they were ungrateful to God and His Messenger and that they not approach formal prayer but while they are lazy and they spend but as ones who dislike to spend
So let not their wealth impress thee nor their children. God wants only to punish them in this present life and so that their souls depart while they are ones who are ungrateful
And they swear by God that they are, truly, of you while they are not of you. They are but a folk who are in fear
If they find a shelter or a place to creep into or a place of retreat, they would turn to it as they rush away
And among them there are some who find fault with thee about charities. If they were given a part of it, they were well-pleased, but if they are not given of it, that is when they are displeased
Better if they were well-pleased with what God gave them and His Messenger. And they had said: God is Enough for us. God will give to us of His grace and so will His Messenger. Truly, to God we are ones who quest
Charities are only for the poor and the needy and the ones who work to collect it and the ones whose hearts are brought together and to free the bondsperson and the ones who are in debt and in the way of God and for the traveler of the way. This is a duty to God. And God is Knowing, Wise
And among them are those who malign the Prophet and say: He is unquestioning. Say: He is unquestioning of what is good for you. He believes in God and believes in ones who believe. And he is a mercy to those of you who believed. And those of you who malign the Messenger of God, for them is a painful punishment
They swear by God to you to please you, but God and His Messenger have better right that they should please Him if they had been ones who believe
Know they not that whoever opposes God and His Messenger, then, truly, for him will be the fire of hell—one who will dwell in it forever? That is the tremendous degradation
The ones who are hypocrites are fearful that should be sent down against them a Chapter of the Quran to tell them what is in their hearts. Say: Ridicule us, but, truly, God is One Who Drives Out that of which you are fearful
And if thou hadst asked them, they would say: Truly, we had only been engaging in idle talk and playing. Say: Was it God and His signs and His Messenger that you had been ridiculing
Make no excuses! Surely, you disbelieved after your belief. If We pardon a section of you, We will punish another section because, truly, they had been ones who sin
The ones who are male hypocrites and the ones who are female hypocrites, some are of some other. They command that which is unlawful and prohibit that which is honorable and close their hands. They forgot God so He forgot them. Truly, the ones who are hypocrites, they are the ones who disobey
And God promised the males, ones who hypocrites and the females, ones who are hypocrites and the ones who are ungrateful, the fire of hell, ones who will dwell in it forever! It will be enough for them. God cursed them. And for them is an abiding punishment
Like those before you who had been with more strength than you and more wealth and children, they enjoyed their apportionment so you enjoyed your apportionment as enjoyed those who were before you their apportionment. And you engaged in idle talk as they engaged in idle talk. As to those, their actions were fruitless in the present and are such in the world to come. And those, they are the ones who are losers
Approaches them not the tidings of those before them—the folk of Noah and of Ad and of Thamud, and of a folk of Abraham, and of the Companions of Midian, and that which are cities overthrown? Their Messengers approached them with the clear portents. So it had not been God who did wrong to them, rather, they had been doing wrong to themselves
The males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe, some are protectors of some other. They command to that which is honorable and they prohibit that which is unlawful and they perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and obey God and His Messenger. Those, God will have mercy on them. Truly, God is Almighty, Wise
God promised males, the ones who believe and the females, the ones who believe, Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever and good dwellings in the Gardens of Eden. And the greater contentment is with God. That, it is the winning of the sublime triumph
O Prophet! Struggle with the ones who are ungrateful and the ones who are hypocrites and be thou harsh against them. And their place of shelter will be hell. Miserable will be the Homecoming
They swear by God that they said not against the Prophet but, certainly, they said the word of ingratitude and they were ungrateful after their submission to God. And they were about to do something that they never attain. And they sought revenge but that God would enrich them and His Messenger with His grace. And if they repent, it would be better for them. And if they turn away, God will punish them with a painful punishment in the present and in the world to come. And there is not for them on earth either a protector or a helper
And of them are some who made a contract with God saying: If He gave us of His grace, we will be charitable and, certainly, we will be among the ones in accord with morality
Then, when He gave them of His grace, they were misers with it and turned away and they were ones who turn aside
He made the consequence hypocrisy in their hearts until a Day they will meet Him because they broke with God what they promised Him, because they had been lying against Him
Know they not that God knows their conspiring secretly and their secret? And that God is The Knower of the unseen
Those who find fault with ones who are volunteer donors to charities from among the ones who believe and those who find not but their striving to give, so they derided them. God will deride them. And they will have a painful punishment
Ask for forgiveness for them or ask not for forgiveness for them, if thou hast asked for forgiveness for them seventy times, God will never forgive them. That is because they were ungrateful to God and His Messenger. And God guides not the folk, the ones who disobey
The ones who are left behind were glad of their positions behind the Messenger of God. And they disliked struggling with their wealth and themselves in the way of God. And they said: Move not forward in the heat. Say: The fire of hell has more severe heat. Would that they had been understanding
So let them laugh a little and weep much as a recompense for what they had been earning
Then, God returned thee to a section of them. And they asked thy permission for going forth. Then, say: You will never ever go forth with me nor fight an enemy with me. You were well-pleased sitting the first time. Then, sit—ones who await with who lagged behind
Pray thou not formally for any of them who died, ever, nor stand up at his grave. Truly, they were ungrateful to God and His Messenger and died while they are ones who disobey
And let not their wealth impress you nor their children. For God only wants to punish them with these in the present and their souls depart while they were ones who are ungrateful
When a Chapter of the Quran was caused to descend saying that: Believe in God and struggle along with His Messenger, those imbued with affluence ask permission of thee. And they said: Forsake us. We would be with the ones who sit at home
They were well-pleased to be with those who stay behind. And a seal was set on their hearts so they understand not
But the Messenger and those who believed with him struggled with their wealth and their lives. Those, for them are good deeds. And those, they are the ones who will prosper
God prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever. That is the winning of the sublime triumph
And the ones who make excuses drew near from among the nomads that permission be given them. And they sat back, those who lied against God and His Messenger. There will light on those who were ungrateful among them a painful punishment
Not on the weak nor on the sick nor on those who find nothing to spend is there fault if they were true to God and His Messenger. There is no way against the ones who are doers of good. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Nor on those who when they approached thee that thou wouldst find mounts to carry them, thou hadst said: I find not what will carry you. So they turned away while their eyes overflow with tears of grief when they find nothing for them to spend in the way of God
The way of blame is only against those who ask thee permission to remain behind and they are rich. They were well-pleased to be with those who stay behind. And God set a seal on their hearts so that they know not
They will make excuses to you when you returned to them. Say: Make no excuses. We will never believe you. Surely, God told us news about you. God and His Messenger will consider your actions. Again, you will be returned to One Who Knows the unseen and the visible. Then, He will tell you of what you had been doing
They will swear to you by God when you turned about to them so that you renounce them. So renounce them. Truly, they are a disgrace. And their place of shelter will be hell, as a recompense for what they had been earning
They swear to you so that you will be well-pleased with them. So while you be well-pleased with them, then, truly, God is not well-pleased with the folk, the ones who disobey
The nomads are stauncher in ingratitude and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the ordinances that God caused to descend to His Messenger. And God is Knowing, Wise
And of the nomads are some who take what they spend to themselves as something owed them and await for some turn of your fortunes. Theirs will be the reprehensible turn of fortune. And God is Hearing, Knowing
And of the nomads are some who believe in God and the Last Day and take for himself what he spends—as an offering to God—and blessings of the Messenger that will be sent for them. No doubt these are not but an offering from them. God will cause them to enter into His mercy. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
As for the forerunners, the ones who take the lead among the ones who emigrate and the helpers and those who followed them with kindness, God was well-pleased with them and they were well-pleased with Him. He prepared for them Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever, eternally. That is the winning of the sublime triumph
And from around you of the nomads are ones who are hypocrites. And from among the people of the city, some grew bold in hypocrisy. Thou hast not known them but We know them. We will, truly, punish them two times in this world. Again, they will be returned to a tremendous punishment
And others acknowledged their impieties. They mixed actions, ones in accord with morality with others that are bad deeds. Perhaps God will turn to them in forgiveness. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Take charity from their wealth to purify them and make them pure with it. And invoke blessings for them. Truly, thy entreaties will bring a sense of comfort and rest to them. And God is Hearing, Knowing
Know they not that God is He Who accepts remorse from His servants and takes charities and that God, He is The Accepter of Repentance, The Compassionate
And say: Act! God will consider your actions and so will His Messenger and the ones who believe. And you will be returned to Him, One Who Knows of the unseen and the visible. Then, He will tell you what you had been doing
And there are others, ones who are waiting in suspense for the command of God. Either He will punish them or He will turn to them in forgiveness. And God is Knowing, Wise
Mention those who took to themselves places of prostration by injuring and in ingratitude and separating and dividing between the ones who believe and as a stalking place for whoever warred against God and His Messenger before. And they will, certainly, swear that: We wanted nothing but the fairer. And God bears witness that they are, truly, ones who lie
And stand not up in it ever! A place of prostration that was founded from the first day on God-consciousness is more rightful that thou hast stood up in it. In it are men who love to cleanse themselves. And God loves the ones who cleanse themselves
Is one who founded his structure on the God-consciousness of God and His contentment better than he who founded his structure on the brink of a crumbling, tottering bank of a river so that it tumbled with him into the fire of hell? And God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust
The structure they built will cease not the skepticism in their hearts until their hearts are cut asunder. And God is Knowing, Wise
Truly, God bought from the ones who believe themselves and their properties. For them is the Garden! They fight in the way of God so they kill and are slain. It is a promise rightfully on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Quran. And who is more true to His compact than God? Then, rejoice in the good tidings of the bargain that you made in trading with Him. And that, it is the winning the sublime triumph
for the repentant worshippers, the ones who praise, the ones who are inclined to fasting, the ones who bow down, the ones who prostrate themselves, the ones who command that which is honorable and the ones who prohibit that which is unlawful, and the ones who guard the ordinances of God, and give thou good tidings to the ones who believe
It had not been for the Prophet and those who believed to ask for forgiveness for ones who are polytheists—even if they had been imbued with kinship—after it became clear to them that they are the Companions of Hellfire
And had not been Abraham asking for forgiveness for his father only because of a promise he had promised him? Then, when it became clear to him that, truly, he was an enemy to God, he cleared himself from him. Truly, Abraham was sympathetic and forbearing
God would not have been causing a folk to go astray after He guided them until He makes manifest to them of what they should be Godfearing. Truly, God is Knowing of everything
Truly, God, to Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and He causes to die. And there is not for you other than God, either a protector or a helper
Certainly, God turned towards the Prophet and the ones who emigrate and the helpers who followed him in the hour of adversity after the hearts of a group of people were about to swerve among them. Again, He turned towards them. Truly, He is Gentle, Compassionate
And upon the three who were left behind when the earth became narrow for them—for all its breadth—and their souls became narrow for them and they thought that there was no shelter from God, but in Him, again, He turns to them in forgiveness so that they would turn towards Him. Truly, God, He is The Accepter of Repentance, The Compassionate
O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God and be with the ones who are sincere
It had not been for the people of the city and among the nomads around them to stay behind from the Messenger of God nor prefer themselves more than himself. That is because they were neither lit on by thirst nor fatigue nor emptiness in the way of God nor tread they any treading on any ground—enraging the ones who are ungrateful—nor glean any gleaning of ground against the enemy but as an action in accord with morality written down for them. Truly, God wastes not the compensation of the ones who are doers of good
Nor spend they contributions—be they small or great—nor cross they over a valley, but it was written down for them that God will give recompense to them for the fairer of what they had been doing
And it had not been for the ones who believe to move forward collectively. If every band moved not forward of them but a section of people only, that they become learned in the way of life and that they warn their folk when they returned to them so that perhaps they will beware
O those who have believed! Fight the ones who are close to you of the ones who are ungrateful. And let them find harshness in you. And know that God is with the ones who are Godfearing
And whenever there was caused to descend a Chapter of the Quran, some of them say: Which of you had this increased in belief? As for those who believed, it increased them in belief and they rejoice at the good tidings
But as for those who, in their hearts, is a sickness, it increased disgrace to their disgrace and they died while they are the ones who are ungrateful
Consider they not that they are tried one time or two times a year? Again, they neither repent nor they recollect
And whenever there was caused to descend a Chapter of the Quran, some looked at some others saying: Is anyone seeing you? Again, they took flight. God turned away from their hearts because they are a folk who understand not
Certainly, there drew near to you a Messenger from among yourselves. It was grievous to him that you fell into misfortune. He is anxious for you and to the ones who believe, gentle, compassionate
But if they turned away, say: God is enough for me. There is no god but He. In Him I put my trust. And He is the Lord of the Sublime Throne
Al\f L[m R]
These are the signs of the wise Book. Had it been for humanity to wonder that We revealed to a man from among them that: Warn humanity and give thou good tidings to those who believed so that they will have a sound footing with their Lord? The ones who are ungrateful said: Truly, this is one who is a clear sorcerer
Truly, your Lord is God Who created the heavens and the earth in six days. Again, He turned Himself to the Throne managing the command. There is no intercessor but after His permission. That is God, your Lord, so worship Him alone. Will you not, then, recollect
To Him is your return, altogether. The promise of God is true. It is He Who begins the creation. Again, He will cause it to return so that He may give recompense to those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality with equity. And those who are ungrateful, for them is a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they had been ungrateful
It is He Who made the sun an illumination and the moon as a light and ordained its mansions so that you would know the number of the years and the reckoning. God created that only in Truth. He explains distinctly the signs for a folk who know
Truly, in the alternation of the nighttime and the daytime and whatever God has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a folk who are Godfearing
Truly, those who hope not for their meeting with Us, but were well-pleased with this present life and were secured in it, those, they are ones who are heedless of Our signs
Those, their place of shelter will be the fire because of what they had been earning
Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, their Lord will guide them in their belief. Rivers will run beneath them in Gardens of Bliss
They will be calling out from there: Glory be to Thee, O God! And their greetings in it will be: Peace! And the last of their calling out will be that: The Praise belongs to God the Lord of the worlds
And if God is to quicken the worst for humanity, as they would desire to hasten for the good, their term would be decided. But We forsake those who hope not for the meeting with Us, wandering unwilling to see in their defiance
And when harm afflicted the human being, he calls to Us on his side or as one who sits at home or as one who is standing up. But when We removed his harm from him, he passed by as if he had never been calling to Us for harm that afflicted him. Thus, made to appear pleasing to the ones who are excessive is what they had been doing
And, certainly, We caused to perish generations before you when they did wrong while their Messengers drew near with the clear portents, but they had not been such as to believe. Thus, We give recompense to the folk, the ones who sin
Again, We made you viceregents on the earth after them that We look on how you would do
And when are recounted to them Our signs, clear portents, those who hope not for their meeting with Us said: Bring us a Recitation other than this or substitute it. Say: It be not possible for me to substitute it of my own accord. I follow nothing but what is revealed to me. Truly, I fear if I rebelled against my Lord a punishment on the tremendous Day
Say: If God willed, I would not have related it to you nor would He have caused you to recognize it. Surely, I lingered in expectation among you a lifetime before this. Will you not, then, be reasonable
So who did greater wrong than he who devised a lie against God or denied His signs? Truly, the ones who sin will not prosper
And they worship other than God things that injure them not, nor profit them. And they say: These are our intercessors with God. Say: Are you telling God of what He knows not in the heavens nor in and on the earth? Glory be to Him and exalted is He above partners they ascribe
And humanity had not been but one community, but, then, they became at variance. And if it were not for a Word that preceded from thy Lord, it would be decided between them immediately about what they are at variance in it
And they say: Why was a sign not caused to descend from his Lord? Say: Truly, the unseen belongs only to God. So wait awhile. Truly, I am with you of the ones who are waiting awhile
And when We caused humanity to experience mercy after tribulation afflicted them, that is when they conspired against Our signs. Say: God is Swifter in planning. Truly, Our messengers write down what you plan
He it is Who sets you in motion through dry land and the sea until when you had been in boats and they ran them with the good wind and they were glad in it. A tempest wind drew near them. Waves drew near from every place, and they thought that they were enclosed by it. They called to God, ones who are sincere and devoted in their way of life to Him saying: If Thou wert to rescue us from this, we will, certainly, be of the ones who are thankful
But when He rescued them, that is when they are insolent in and on the earth without right. O humanity, your insolence is only against yourselves, an enjoyment of this present life. Again, to Us is your return. Then, We will tell you what you had been doing
The parable of this present life is but like water that We caused to descend from heaven. It mingled with the plants of the earth—from which you eat—humanity and flocks—until when the earth took its ornaments and was decorated and its people thought that, truly, they are ones who have power over it! Our command approached it by nighttime or by daytime. Then, We made it stubble as if it flourished not yesterday. Thus, We explain distinctly the signs for a folk who reflect
And God calls to the Abode of Peace and He guides whom He wills to a straight path
For those who did good is the fairer and increase. Neither will gloom come over their faces nor abasement. Those are the Companions of the Garden. They are ones who will dwell in it forever
And for those who earned evil deeds, the recompense of an evil deed will be its like and abasement will come over them. They will have none but God as One Who Saves from Harm. It is as if their faces were covered with a strip of the night, one in darkness. Those are the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever
And on a Day We will assemble them altogether. Again, We will say to those who ascribed partners with God: Stay in your place, you and your ascribed associates. Then, We will set a space between them. And their ascribed associates would say: It had not been us that you were worshipping
And God sufficed as a witness between you and between us. We had been of your worship certainly, ones who are heedless
There every soul will be tried for what it has did in the past. And they would be returned to God, their Defender, The Truth. And from them will go astray what they had been devising
Say: Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Who controls having the ability to hear and sight? And Who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who manages the command? They will, then, say: God! Say: Will you not be Godfearing
Such is God, your Lord, The Truth. And what else is there after The Truth but wandering astray. Where, then, turn you away
Thus, was the Word of thy Lord realized against those who disobeyed that they will not believe
Say: Are there among your ascribed associates with God anyone who begins the creation and, then, causes it to return? Say: God begins the creation. Again, He causes it to return. Then, how you are misled
Say: Are there among your ascribed associates with God anyone who guides to The Truth? Say: God guides to The Truth. Has not He who guides to The Truth a better right to be followed than he who guides not unless he himself be guided? What is the matter with you? How you give judgment
And most of them follow nothing but opinion. Truly, opinion avails them not against The Truth at all. Truly, God is Knowing of what they accomplish
This Recitation had not been devised by other than God because it establishes as true what was before it and as a decisive explanation of the Book. There is no doubt in it. It is from the Lord of the worlds
Or they will say: He devised it. Say: Bring a Chapter of the Quran like it and call to whomever you were able—other than God—if you had been ones who are sincere
Nay! They denied the knowledge that they comprehend not while approaches them not the interpretation. Thus, those who were before them denied. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who are unjust
And of them are some who believe in it and of them are some who believe not in it. And thy Lord is greater in knowledge of the ones who make corruption
And if they denied thee, then, thou say: For me are my actions and for you are your actions. You are free of what I do and I am free of what you do
And among them are some who listen to thee. So hast thou caused someone unwilling to hear, to hear if they had not been reasonable
And among them are some who look on thee. So hast thou guided the unwilling to see if they had not been perceiving
Truly, God does not wrong humanity at all, but humanity does wrong itself
And on a Day He will assemble them as if they had not been lingering in expectation but an hour of the daytime. They will recognize one another among themselves. Surely, those who denied lost the meeting with God and they had not been ones who are truly guided
Whether We cause thee to see some of what We promise them or We call thee to Us, then, to Us is their return. Again, God will be witness to what they accomplish
Every community has its Messenger. So, then, when their Messenger drew near, it would be decided between them with equity. And they, they will not be wronged
And they say: When is this promise if you had been ones who are sincere
Say: I control not either hurt or profit for myself, but what God willed. To every community there is a term. When their term draws near, neither will they delay it an hour nor will they press it forward
Say: Considered you that if His punishment approached you at nighttime or at daytime, for which portion would the ones who sin be ones who seek to hasten
Again, when it falls on you, believed you in it? Now? While you had been seeking to hasten it
Again, it would be said to those who did wrong: Experience the infinite punishment! Will you be given recompense but for what you had been earning
And they ask thee to be told: Is it true? Say: Yes! By my Lord it is The Truth and you are not ones who frustrate Him
And if there would be for every person who did wrong whatever is in or on the earth, he would, certainly, offer it for his ransom. And they would keep secret their self-reproach when they considered the punishment. But it will be decided between them with equity. And they, they will not be wronged
No doubt to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. No doubt the promise of God is true, but most of them know not
It is He Who gives life and causes to die and to Him you will return
O humanity! Surely, an admonishment drew near you from your Lord and a healing for what is in the breasts and a guidance and mercy for ones who believe
Say: In the grace of God and in His mercy therein let them be glad. That is better than what they gather
Say: Considered you from what God caused to descend for you of provision and that you made some of it unlawful and some lawful? Say: Gave God permission to you or devise you against God
And what is the opinion of those who devise a lie against God on the Day of Resurrection? Truly, God is Possessor of Grace to humanity, but most of them give not thanks
Neither hast thou been on any matter nor hast thou recounted from the Recitation nor are you doing any action but We had been ones who bear witness over you when you press on it. And nothing escapes from thy Lord of the weight of an atom in or on the earth nor in the heaven nor what is smaller than that nor what is greater than that but it is in a clear Book
No doubt with the faithful friends of God there will be neither fear in them nor will they feel remorse
Those who believed and had been Godfearing
for them are good tidings in this present life and in the world to come. There is no substitution of the Words of God. That, it is the winning the sublime triumph
And let not their saying dishearten thee.• Truly, all great glory belongs to God. He is The Hearing, The Knowing
No doubt to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. And follow not those who call to ascribed associates other than God. They follow nothing but opinion and they do nothing but guess
It is He Who made the nighttime for you so that you rest in it and the daytime for one who perceives. Truly, in this are signs for a folk who hear
They said God took to Himself a son. Glory be to Him. He is Sufficient. To Him is whatever is in the heavens and in and on the earth. With you there is no authority for this. Say you against God what you know not
Say: Truly, those who devise lies against God, they will not prosper
only an enjoyment in the present! Again, to Us will be their return. Again, We will cause them to experience the severe punishment because they had been ungrateful
And recount to them the tidings of Noah when he said to his folk: O my folk! If my station had been troublesome to you and my reminding you of the signs of God, then, in God I put my trust. So summon up your affair along with your ascribed associates. Again, there be no cause for doubt in your affair. Again, decide against me and give me no respite
Then, if you turned away, I asked you not for any compensation. My compensation is with God. And I was commanded that I be of the ones who submit to God
Then, they denied him, so We delivered him and some with him on the boat. And we made them the viceregents while We drowned those who denied Our signs. Then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who are warned
Again, We raised up Messengers after him to their folk. They drew near them with the clear portents. But they had not been believing in what they had denied before of it. Thus, We set a seal on the hearts of the ones who exceed the limits
Again, We raised up after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his Council with Our signs. Then, they grew arrogant, and they had been a folk, ones who sin
So when The Truth drew near them from Us, they said: Truly, this is clear sorcery
Moses said: Say you this about The Truth when it drew near you? Is this sorcery? And the ones who are sorcerers will not prosper
They said: Hadst thou drawn near to us to turn us from what we found our fathers on so that the domination on the earth might be for you two? We are not ones who believe in both of you
And Pharaoh said: Bring to me every one who is a knowing sorcerer
And when the ones who are sorcerers drew near, Moses said to them: Cast down with ones who cast
Then, when they cast Moses said: What you brought about is sorcery. Truly, God will render it untrue. Truly, God makes not right the actions of the ones who make corruption
And God will verify The Truth by His Words, although the ones who sin disliked it much
But none believed Moses but the offspring of his folk because of the fear of Pharaoh and his Council that he persecute them. And, truly, Pharaoh was one who exalted himself on the earth. And he was, truly, of the ones who are excessive
And Moses said: O my folk! If you had been believing in God, then, put your trust in Him, if you had been ones who submit to God
Then, they said: We put our trust in God. Our Lord! Make us not a temptation for the folk, the ones who are unjust
And deliver us by Thy Mercy from the folk, the ones who are ungrateful
And We revealed to Moses and his brother: Take as your dwellings, houses for your folk in Egypt. Make your houses a direction of formal prayer. And perform the formal prayer. And give good tidings to the ones who believe
And Moses said: Our Lord! Thou hadst given to Pharaoh and his Council adornment and wealth in this present life. Our Lord! Cause them to go astray from Thy way. Our Lord! Obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so that they believe not until they consider the painful punishment
He said: Surely, you both were answered, so go straight both of you and follow not the way of those who know not
And We brought the Children of Israel over the sea. And Pharaoh and his army pursued them in insolence and acting impulsively until when, overtaken by drowning, he said: I believed that there is no god but He in Whom the Children of Israel believed and I am among ones who submit to God
It was said: Now, surely, thou hadst rebelled before and had been among the ones who make corruption
On this day We will deliver thee with thy physical form that thou be a sign to whoever is after thee. And, truly, many among humanity are ones who are heedless of Our signs
And, certainly, We placed the Children of Israel in a sound place of settlement and provided them with what is good. And they are not at variance until the knowledge drew near them. Truly, thy Lord will decree between them on the Day of Resurrection about what they had been at variance in it
So if thou hadst been in uncertainty about what We caused to descend to thee, then, ask those who recited the Book before thee. Certainly, The Truth drew near thee from thy Lord so thou hast not been among the ones who contest
Thou hast not been among those who denied the signs of God, for, then, thou wouldst be among the ones who are losers
Truly, those against whom is realized through the Word of thy Lord, will not believe
—even if every sign drew near them—until they consider the painful punishment
And had there been a town that believed and profited from its belief other than the folk of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of degradation in this present life and gave them enjoyment for a while
And if thy Lord willed, all would have believed who are on the earth altogether. So wouldst thou compel humanity against their will until they become ones who believe
And it would not have been for any person to believe but by the permission of God. And He lays disgrace on those who are not reasonable
Say: Look on what is in the heavens and the earth. And neither the signs nor the warning avail a folk who believe not
So wait they awhile but like in the days of those who passed away before them? Say: So wait awhile. I am with you among the ones waiting awhile
Again, We rescue Our Messengers and those who believed. Thus, it is an obligation upon Us to deliver the ones who believe
Say: O humanity! If you were in uncertainty as to my way of life, then, I will not worship those whom you worship other than God. Rather, I worship only God Who will call you to Himself. And I was commanded that I be among the ones who believe
and that: Settest thou thy face to the way of life of a monotheist. And be thou not among the ones who are polytheists
And call not to other than God what neither profits nor hurts thee. And if thou wert to accomplish that, truly, thou wouldst be among the ones who are unjust
And if God afflicts thee with harm, there is no one who removes it but He. And if He wants good for thee, there is no one who repels His grace. It lights on whomever He wills of His servants. And He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate
Say: O humanity! Surely, The Truth drew near you from your Lord so whoever was truly guided, then, he is only truly guided for his own self. And whoever went astray, then, he only goes astray to his own loss. And I am not a trustee over you
And follow thou what is revealed to thee. And have thou patience until God gives judgment. And He is Best of the ones who judge
Alif L[m R[. A Book, the signs in it were set clear. Again, they were explained distinctly from that which proceeds from the Presence of the Wise, Aware]
that you not worship any but God. Truly, I am a warner to you from Him and a bearer of good tidings
and that: Ask for forgiveness from your Lord. Again, repent to Him that He give you fairer enjoyment for a term that which is determined. He gives His grace to every possessor of grace. And if they turn away, I fear for you the punishment of a Great Day
To God is your return. And He is Powerful over everything
But they fold up their breasts that they conceal themselves from Him. No doubt at the time when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they keep secret and what they speak openly. Truly, He is Knowing of what is in their breasts
And there is no moving creature on earth but its provision is from God. And He knows its appointed time and its repository. All is in a clear Book
And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days. And His Throne had been upon the waters that He try you—which of you is fairer in actions. And if thou wert to say to them: Truly, you are ones who will be raised up after death. Those who were ungrateful would be sure to say: This is nothing but clear sorcery
If We postponed the punishment for them for a period of time, that which is numbered, they will, surely, say: What detains it? Certainly, the day it approaches them, there is not of that which will be turned away from them and surrounded them was what they had been ridiculing of it
And if We caused the human being to experience mercy from Us, then, again, We tear it out from him, truly, he is hopeless, ungrateful
And if We caused him to experience favor after tribulation afflicted him, he is certain to say: Evil deeds went from me! Truly, he becomes glad, boastful
But those who endured patiently and did as the ones in accord with morality, those, for them is forgiveness and a great compensation
So wouldst thou perhaps be one who leaves some of what is revealed to thee? Or is thy breast that which is narrowed by it because they say: Why was a treasure not caused to descend to him or an angel drew near him? Truly, thou art only a warner. And God is a Trustee over everything. Or they say: He devised it
Say: Approach you, then, with ten chapters of the Quran like it, that which is forged, and call to whomever you were able other than God if you had been ones who are sincere
If they respond not to you, then, know that it was only caused to descend by the knowledge of God and that there is no god but He. Are you, you, then, ones who submit to God
Whoever had been wanting this present life and its adornment, We pay their account in full to them for their actions in it. And they will not be diminished in it
Those are those for whom there is nothing in the world to come but fire. And what they crafted here was fruitless. And what they had been doing is in vain
Is he, then, who had been on a clear portent from his Lord, and recounts it from Him as one who bears witness—and before it was the Book of Moses, a leader and a mercy—like them? Those believe in it. Whoever is ungrateful for it among the confederates, he is promised the fire! So be thou not hesitant about it. Truly, it is The Truth from thy Lord, except most of humanity believes not
Who does greater wrong than he who devised a lie against God? Those will be presented before their Lord. And the ones who bear witness will say: These are those who lied against their Lord. But the curse of God is upon the ones who are unjust—
they who bar from the way of God and desire in it crookedness. And they, in the world to come, they are ones who disbelieve
Those will not be ones who frustrate Him on the earth, nor had there been for them—other than God—any protectors.• The punishment is multiplied for them. Not had they been able to have the ability to hear, nor had they been perceiving
Those are those who lost their souls. What they had been devising had gone astray
Without a doubt they in the world to come, they are the ones who are losers
Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and humbled themselves before their Lord, those will be the Companions of the Garden. They, ones who will dwell in it forever
The parable of the two groups of people is as the one unwilling to see, unwilling to hear and the other, seeing and hearing. They are not on the same level in likeness. Will you not, then, recollect
And, certainly, We sent Noah to his folk: Truly, I am a clear warner to you
that you worship none but God. Truly, I fear for you the punishment of a painful Day
Then, the Council of those who were ungrateful said from among his folk: We see thee only as a mortal like us. We see none followed thee but those, they who are visibly our most wretched, simple minded. Nor we see you as having any merit above us. Nay! We think that you are ones who lie
He said: O my folk! Considered you that I had been with a clear portent from my Lord and that He gave me mercy from Himself but it was invisible to you? Then, will we fasten you to it when you are ones who dislike it
And O my folk! I ask not of you wealth for it. My compensation is but with God. And I will not be one who drives away those who believed. Truly, they are ones who will encounter their Lord while I see you a folk who are ignorant
And O my folk! Who would help me against God if I drove them away? Will you not, then, recollect
And I say not to you: The treasures of God are with me nor that I know the unseen nor I say: Truly, I am an angel nor I say of those whom your eyes look down upon: God will never give them good. God is greater in knowledge of what is within their souls for, then, I would be of the ones who are unjust
They said: O Noah! Surely, thou hadst disputed with us, then, made much of the dispute with us. Now approach us with what thou hast promised us if thou hadst been among the ones who are sincere
He said: Only God will bring it on you if He willed. And you will not be ones who frustrate Him
And my advice will not profit you—even if I wanted to advise you—if God hadst been wanting to lead you into error. He is your Lord and to Him you will return
Or they say: He devised it. Say: If I devised it, my sin is upon me and I am free of your sins
And it was revealed to Noah: Truly, none of thy folk will believe but who had already believed. So be thou not despondent at what they have been accomplishing
And craft thou the boat under Our Eyes and by Our Revelation and address Me not for those who did wrong. They are, truly, ones who are drowned
And he crafts the boat. Whenever the Council passed by him of his folk, they derided him. He said: If you deride us, then, we will deride you just as you deride us
And you will know to whom will approach a punishment covering with shame and on whom an abiding punishment will alight
Until when Our command drew near and the oven boiled, We said: Carry in it of every living thing, two, a pair and thy people, but him against whom the saying has preceded and who believed. And none but a few believed with him
And he said: Embark in it. In the Name of God will be the course of the ship and its berthing. Truly, my Lord is Forgiving, Compassionate
So it runs with them amidst waves like mountains. And Noah cried out to his son and he had been standing apart: O my son! Embark with us and be thou not with the ones who are ungrateful
He said: I will take shelter for myself on a mountain. It will be what saves me from the harm of the water. Noah said: No one saves from the harm this day from the command of God but him on whom He had mercy. And a wave came between them so he had been of the ones who are drowned
And it was said: O earth! Take in thy water! And O heaven: Desist! And the water was shrunken and the command of God was satisfied and it was on the same level as Al-Judi. And it was said: Away with the folk, the ones who are unjust
And Noah cried out to his Lord and said: My Lord! Truly, my son is of my people. And, truly, Thy promise is The Truth. And Thou art the Most Just of the ones who judge
He said: O Noah! Truly, he is not of thy people. Truly, he, his actions are not in accord with morality. So ask not of Me what thou hast no knowledge. Truly, I admonish thee so that thou not be of the ones who are ignorant
He said: My Lord! Truly, I take refuge with Thee so that I not ask Thee of what I am without knowledge. Unless Thou art to forgive me and have mercy on me, I would be of the ones who are losers
It was said: O Noah! Get thee down with peace from Us and blessings on thee and on communities from whoever are with thee, and communities to whom We will give enjoyment. And, again, they will be afflicted by Us with a painful punishment
That is of the tidings of the unseen that We reveal to thee. Thou hast not been knowing of them nor thy folk before this. So have thou patience. Truly, the Ultimate End is for the ones who are Godfearing
And to Ad, their brother Hud. He said: O my folk! Worship God! You have no god other than He. You are nothing but ones who devise
O my folk! I ask not of you any compensation. My compensation is but with Who originated me. Will you not, then, be reasonable
And O my folk! Ask your Lord for forgiveness. Again, repent to Him. He will send abundant rain to you from heaven and increase you, adding strength to your strength. So turn not away as ones who sin
They said: O Hud! Hadst thou brought about any clear portent for us? We will not be ones who leave our gods for thy saying? And we are not ones who believe in thee
Truly, we say nothing but that some of our gods inflicted thee with evil. He said: Truly, I call God to witness and bear you witness that I am free from partners you ascribe
other than Him. So try to outwit me altogether. Again, give me no respite
Truly, I put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord. There is not a moving creature but He is One Who Takes of its forelock. Truly, my Lord is on a straight path
But if you turn away, that is your decision. Then, surely, I expressed to you what I was sent with to you. And my Lord will make successors a folk other than you and you will not injure Him at all. Truly, My Lord is Guardian over everything
And Our command drew near. We delivered Hud and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And We delivered them from a harsh punishment
And that was Ad. They negated the signs of their Lord and rebelled against His Messengers. And they followed the command of every haughty and stubborn one
And they were pursued in the present life by a curse. And on the Day of Resurrection, no doubt, truly, Ad were ungrateful to their Lord. Away with Ad, a folk of Hud
And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih. He said: O my folk! Worship God. You have no god other than He. He caused you to grow from the earth and settled you on it. So ask for His forgiveness. Again, repent to Him. Truly, my Lord is Near, One Who Answers
They said: O Salih! Surely, thou hadst been one who is a source of hope to us before this. Hast thou prohibited us that we worship what our fathers worship? And, truly, we are in uncertainty about what thou hast called us to, in grave doubt
He said: O my folk! Considered you that I had been with a clear portent from my Lord and that He gave me a mercy from Himself so who, then, would help me against God if I rebelled against Him? Then, you would increase me not but in decline
And: O my folk! This is the she-camel of God, a sign for you. So let her eat on God’s earth and afflict her not with evil so that a near punishment take you
But they crippled her. So he said: Take joy in your abode for three days. That is a promise, one that will not be belied
Then, Our command drew near. We delivered Salih and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us and from the degradation of that Day. Truly, thy Lord, He is Strong, Almighty
The Cry took those who did wrong. It came to be in the morning in their abodes, ones who are fallen prostrate
as if they dwelt not in them. No doubt, truly, Thamud were ungrateful to their Lord. Away with Thamud
And, certainly, Our messengers drew near Abraham with good tidings. They said: Peace. He said: Peace. And he presently brought about a roasted calf
Then, when he saw their hands reach not out towards it, he became suspicious and sensed awe of them. They said: Fear not. We were sent to the folk of Lot
Abraham’s woman, one who is standing up, laughed when We gave her good tidings of Isaac and besides Isaac, Jacob
She said: Woe to me! Will I give birth when I am an old woman and this, my husband, is an old man? Truly, this is a strange thing
They said: Marvel thou at the command of God? The mercy of God and His blessings be upon you, O People of the House: Truly, He is Worthy of Praise, Glorious
And when the panic went from Abraham and the good tidings drew near to him, he disputes with Us for the folk of Lot
Truly, Abraham was forbearing, sympathetic, one who turns in repentance
O Abraham! Turn aside from this. Truly, the command of thy Lord drew near. And, truly, that which arrives for them is a punishment, one that is not to be repelled
And when Our messengers drew near Lot, he was troubled for them and was concerned for them, being distressed. And he said: This is a distressful day
Then, drew near his folk, running toward him because they had been doing evil deeds before. He said: O my folk! These are my daughters! They are purer for you. So be Godfearing of God. And cover me not with shame as regards my guests. Is there not among you a well-intentioned man
They said: Certainly, thou hadst known we have no right to thy daughters. And, truly, thou hast known well what we want
He said: Would that I had strength against you or take shelter with stauncher support
They said: O Lot! Truly, we are Messengers of thy Lord. They will not reach out to thee so set thou forth with thy people in a part of the night and let not any of you look back, but thy woman. Truly, that which lights on them will light on her. Truly, what is promised to them is in the morning. Is the morning not near
So when Our command drew near, We made its high part low and We rained down on it rocks of baked clay, one upon another
ones that are distinguished, and not far from the ones who are unjust
And We sent to Midian their brother Shuayb. He said: O my folk! Worship God. You have no god other than He. And reduce not the measuring vessel and balance. Truly, I consider you as good. And, truly, I fear for you the punishment of an Enclosing Day
And O my folk! Live up to the measuring vessel and balance in equity. And diminish not of humanity their things. And do no mischief in and on the earth as ones who make corruption
God’s abiding wisdom is best for you if you had been ones who believe. And I am not a Guardian over you
They said: O Shuayb! Is it that thy formal prayer commands thee that we leave what our fathers worship or that we accomplish not with our possibilities whatever we will? Truly, thou art the forbearing, the well-intentioned
He said: O my folk! Considered you that I had been with a clear portent from my Lord. He provided me fairer provision from Himself. And I want not to go against you in what I prohibit you. I want only making things right so far as I was able. And my success is not but from God. In Him I put my trust and to Him I am penitent
And O my folk! Let not your breach with me drive you into being lighted on by the like of what lit on a folk of Noah or a folk of Hud or a folk of Salih. And a folk of Lot are not far from you
And ask for forgiveness from your Lord. Again, repent to Him. Truly, my Lord is Compassionate, Loving
They said: O Shuayb! We understand not much of what thou sayest. And, truly, we see thee weak among us. If it had not been for thy extended family, we would have stoned thee. And thou art not mighty against us
He said: O my folk! Is my extended family mightier to you than God whom you took to yourselves to disregard? Truly, my Lord is One Who Encloses whatever you do
O my folk! Act according to your ability and, truly, I am one who acts. You will know to whom approaches a punishment covering him with shame and who, he is one who lies. And be on the watch! Truly, I am watching with you
And Our command drew near. We delivered Shuayb and those who believed with him by a mercy from Us. And the Cry took those who did wrong. It came to be in the morning in their abodes ones who are fallen prostrate
as if they had not been dwelling in them. Away with Midian just as Thamud was done away
And, certainly, We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear authority
to Pharaoh and his Council but they followed the command of Pharaoh. And the command of Pharaoh was not well-intended
He will go before his folk on the Day of Resurrection and they will be led down into the fire. Miserable will be the watering place, that to which they are led down
And they were pursued by a curse in this life and on the Day of Resurrection! Miserable will be, the oblation, that which is offered
That is from the tidings of the towns that We relate to thee. Of them, some are ones that are standing up and some are stubble
And it was not that We did wrong to them. Rather, they did wrong themselves. And their gods availed them not whom they call to besides God at all. When the command of thy Lord drew near they increased them not other than in ruination
And, thus, is the taking of thy Lord when He took the towns while they are ones who are unjust. Truly, His taking is painful, severe
In that, truly, there is a sign for whoever feared the punishment of the world to come. That Day humanity will be one that is gathered together for it and that will be a witnessed Day
And We postpone it not but for the numbered term
On the Day it approaches no person will assert anything but with His permission. Then, among them will be the disappointed and the happy
As for those who were in despair, they will be in the fire. For them in it is sobbing and sighing
ones who will dwell in it for as long as the heavens and the earth continued, but what thy Lord willed. Truly, thy Lord is Achiever of what He wants
And as for those who were happy, they will be in the Garden, ones who will dwell in it for as long as the heavens and the earth continued, but what thy Lord willed, a gift that will not be that which is broken
So be thou not hesitant as to what these worship. They worship nothing but what their fathers worship before. And We are the ones who pay their share in full without being that which is reduced
And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book, but they were at variance about it. And if it were not for a Word that preceded from thy Lord, it would be decided between them. And, truly, they were uncertain about it, ones in grave doubt
And, truly, to each his account will be paid in full by thy Lord for their actions. Truly, He is Aware of what they do
So go thou straight as thou wert commanded and those who repented with thee and be not defiant. Truly, He is Seeing of what you do
Then, incline not to those who did wrong so the fire afflict you and there will not be for you any protectors other than God. Again, you will not be helped
And perform the formal prayer at the two ends of the daytime and at nearness of the nighttime. Truly, benevolence causes evil deeds to be put away. That is a reminder for the ones who remember
And have thou patience, for, truly, God wastes not the compensation of the ones who are doers of good
Why had there not been among the generations before you imbued with abiding wisdom, prohibiting corruption in and on the earth, but a few of those whom We rescue from among them? And those who did wrong followed what they were given ease in it. And they had been ones who sin
Thy Lord had not been causing the towns to perish unjustly while their people are ones who make things right
And if thy Lord willed, He would have made humanity one community. But they cease not to be ones who are at variance
but on whom thy Lord had mercy. And for that, He created them, and completed was the Word of thy Lord. Certainly, I will fill hell with genie and humanity one and all
And all that We relate to thee of the tidings of the Messengers is so that We make thy mind firm by it. And The Truth drew near thee in this, and an admonishment and a reminder for the ones who believe
And say to those who believe not: Act according to your ability. Truly, We are ones who act
And wait awhile. We, too, are ones who are waiting awhile
And to God belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth. And to Him is the return of every command, so worship Him and put thy trust in Him. And thy Lord is not One Who is Heedless of what you do
Alif L[m R[. That are the signs of the clear Book]
Truly, We caused to descend a Recitation in Arabic so that perhaps you will be reasonable
We relate to thee the fairer of narratives through what We revealed to thee of this, the Quran, although thou hadst been before this among the ones who are heedless
Mention when Joseph said to his father: O my father! Truly, I saw eleven stars and the sun and the moon. I saw them as ones prostrating themselves to me
He said: O my son! Relate not thy dream to thy brothers so that they contrive cunning against thee. Truly, Satan is a clear enemy to the human being
And, thus, thy Lord will elect thee and teach thee of the interpretation of events. And He will fulfill His divine blessing on thee and on the people of Jacob just as He fulfilled it on thy two fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Truly, thy Lord is Knowing, Wise
Certainly, there had been in Joseph and his brothers signs for the ones who ask
When they said: Certainly, Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, although we are many. Truly, our father is clearly wandering astray
Kill Joseph or fling him to some other region to free the face of your father for you. You be a folk after that ones in accord with morality
Said one who says: Kill not Joseph, but cast him into the bottom of a well. Some company of travelers will pick him out, if you had been ones who do this
They said: O our father! Why wilt thou not entrust us with Joseph when we are, truly, ones who will, certainly, look after him
Send him with us tomorrow to frolic and play. And, truly, we are ones who guard him
He said: Truly, it disheartens me that you go with him. And I fear that a wolf eat him while you are ones who are heedless of him
They said: If a wolf ate him while we are many, truly, then, we are ones who are losers
So they went with him, and they agreed to lay him in the bottom of the well. And We revealed to him: Certainly, thou wilt tell them of this, their affair, when they are not aware
And they drew near their father in the time of night, weeping
They said: O our father! Truly, we went racing and we left Joseph with our sustenance and a wolf ate him and thou wilt not be one who believes us, even if we had been ones who are sincere
And they brought about his long shirt with false blood. He said: Nay! Your souls enticed you with a command. Having patience is graceful. And it is God, One Whose Help is being sought against what you allege
And there drew near a company of travelers so they sent their water-drawer to let down his bucket. He said: What good tidings! This is a boy! So they kept him secret as merchandise. And God is Knowing of what they do
And they sold him for a meager price of coins, ones that are numbered. And they had been of him among the ones who hold him in low esteem
One from Egypt who bought him said to his woman: Honor him as a guest with a place of lodging. Perhaps he will profit us or we will take him to ourselves as a son. And, thus, We established Joseph firmly in the earth that We teach him the interpretation of events. God is One Who is Victor over His command, except most of humanity knows not
And when he had fully grown and come of age, We gave him critical judgment and knowledge. And, thus, We give recompense to the ones who are doers of good
And she in whose house he was solicited him, enticing him to evil. And she shut the doors and said: Come thou! He said: God be my safe place. Truly, he, thy husband, is my master and He gave me a goodly place of lodging. Truly, the ones who are unjust will not prosper
She, certainly, was about to act on her desire for him and he was about to act on his desire for her, if it were not that he saw proof of his Lord. Thus, it was that We turn away from him evil and depravity. And, truly, he was among Our servants, ones who are devoted
So they raced to the door and she tore his long shirt from behind. And they both discovered her chief at the door. She said: What is the recompense of him who wanted evil for thy household, but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment
He said: She solicited me, enticing me to evil. And one who bears witness bore witness from her household and said: If his long shirt had been torn from the front, then, she was sincere, and he was among the ones who lie
But if his long shirt had been torn from behind, she lied against herself; he was among ones who are sincere
When her husband saw his long shirt was torn from behind, he said: It is of your (f) cunning; truly, your (f) cunning is serious
Joseph! Turn aside from this! To his wife he said: Ask thou for forgiveness for thy (f) impiety; truly, thou (f) hadst been of the ones who are inequitable
And the ladies in the city said: The woman of the great one solicits her spiritual warrior, enticing him to evil. Surely, he captivated her longing. Truly, we consider her to be clearly wandering astray
So when she heard of their planning, she sent for them (f), and made ready for them a banquet. And she gave each one of them (f) a knife, and said to Joseph: Go forth before them (f). Then, when they saw him, they admired him and cut their hands. And they (f) said: God save us! This is not a mortal. This is nothing but a generous angel
She said: This is he about whom you (f) blamed me. And, certainly, I solicited him, enticing him to evil, but he preserved himself from sin. And now if he accomplishes not what I command, he will, certainly, be imprisoned and will be among the ones who are disgraced
He said: O my Lord! Prison is more beloved to me than what they call me to. Unless Thou hast turned away their (f) cunning from me, I will yearn towards them (f) and I will be among the ones who are ignorant
So his Lord responded to him and turned away their (f) cunning from him. Truly, He, He is The Hearing, The Knowing
Again, it showed itself to them. And after they saw the signs, it seemed that they should imprison him for a while
And there entered with him in the prison two male spiritual warriors. One of them said: Truly, I see myself pressing grapes in season. And the other said: Truly, I see myself carrying bread over my head from which birds are eating. They said: Tell us the interpretation of this. Truly, we consider thee among the ones who are doers of good
He said: The food you both are provided approaches you not, but I will tell you of its interpretation before it approaches. That is of what my Lord taught me. Truly, I left the creed of a folk who believe not in God and they, in the world to come, they are ones who disbelieve
And I followed the creed of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It had not been for us that we ascribe anything as partners with God. That is from the grace of God to us and to humanity, except most of humanity gives not thanks
O my two prison companions! Are ones that are different masters better or God, The One, The Omniscient
Whomever you worship other than He are nothing but names that you named—you and your fathers for which God caused not to descend any authority. The determination is from God alone. He commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the truth-loving way of life, except most of humanity knows not
O my two prison companions! As for one of you, he will give intoxicants to drink to his master. And as for the other, he will be crucified. And birds will eat from his head. The matter was decided about which you ask for advice
And he said to the one of them whom he thought should be the one who is saved of the two: Remember me to thy master. Then, Satan caused him to forget the remembrance of him to his master so Joseph lingered in expectation in prison for a certain number of years
And the king said: Truly, I, I see seven fattened cows eating seven lean ones and seven ears of green wheat and others dry. O Council: Render an opinion to me about my dream if you had been able to expound dreams
They said: Jumbled nightmares. And we are not of the interpretation of nightmares ones who know
And said the man of the two of them who was delivered and recalled after a period of time: I will tell you its interpretation so send me
Joseph, O thou just person! Render an opinion to us about seven fattened cows eaten by seven lean ones and seven ears of green wheat and others dry so that perhaps I will return to the personages so that perhaps they will know about thee
He said: You will sow for seven years in like previous manner and of what you reaped, then, forsake ears of wheat, but a little of it that you may eat
Again, seven severe years will approach after that. You will eat what you put forward, but a little of what you keep in store
Again, after that, will approach a year in which humanity will be helped with rain and they will press in season
And the king said: Bring him to me. Then, when the Messenger brought about, he said: Return to thy master and ask him: What of the ladies, those who cut their hands? Truly, my Lord is Knowing of their (f) cunning
He said: What was your (f) business when you solicited Joseph, enticing him to evil? They (f) said: God save us! We knew not any evil against him. The woman of the great one said: Now The Truth was discovered! I sought to solicit him, enticing him to evil. And, truly, he is among the ones who are sincere
Joseph said: That is so that the great one know that I betray him not in his absence. And that God guides not the cunning of the ones who are traitors
And I declare my soul not innocent. Truly, the soul is that which incites to evil, but when my Lord had mercy. Truly, my Lord is Forgiving, Compassionate
And the king said: Bring him to me so that I attach him to myself. Then, when he spoke to him he said: Truly, this day thou art with us secure, trustworthy
Joseph said: Assign me over the storehouses of the region. Truly, I will be a knowing guardian
And, thus, We established Joseph firmly in the region to take his dwelling in it when or where he wills. We light Our mercy on whom We will and We waste not the compensation of ones who are doers of good
Truly, the compensation of the world to come is better for those who believed and had been Godfearing
And Joseph’s brothers drew near and they entered before him. He recognized them, but they are ones who know him not
And when he equipped them with their food supplies, he said: Bring me a brother of yours from your father. See you not that I live up to full measure and that I am best of the ones who host
Then, if you bring him not to me, there will be no full measure for you with me, nor will you come near me
They said: We will solicit his father for him and, truly, we are ones who do it
And Joseph said to his spiritual warriors: Lay their merchandise into their saddlebags so that perhaps they will recognize it when they turned about to their household so that perhaps they will return
So when they returned to their father, they said: O our father! The full measure was refused to us so send our brother with us that we will obtain our measure. And, truly, we will be ones who guard him
Jacob said: How will I entrust him to you as I entrusted you with his brother before? But, then, God is Best of One Who Guards. And He is One Who is the Most Merciful of the ones who are the most merciful
And when they opened their sustenance, they found their merchandise was returned to them. They said: O our father, this is what we desire. Our merchandise was returned to us and we will get provision for our household and we will keep our brother safe and add a camel’s load of full measure. That is an easy full measure
He said: I will not send him with you until you give me a pledge by God that you will bring him back to me, unless you are enclosed yourselves. And when they gave him their pledge, he said: God is Trustee over what we say
And he said: O my sons! Enter not by one door, but enter by different doors. I will not avail you against God in anything. Truly, the determination is but with God. In Him I put my trust. And in Him put their trust the ones who put their trust
And when they entered from where their father commanded, it had not been availing them against God in anything, but it was a need of Jacob’s inner self which he satisfied. And, truly, he was a possessor of knowledge because We taught him, except most of humanity knows not
And when they entered before Joseph, he himself gave refuge to his brother. He said: Truly, I am thy brother, so be not despondent for what they had been doing
So when he equipped them with their food supplies, he laid the drinking cup into their brother’s saddlebag. Again, one who announces announced: O you in the caravan! Truly, you are ones who are thieves
They said coming forward: What is it that you are missing
They said: We are missing the king’s drinking cup and for him who brought it about is a camel’s load and I am the guarantor for it
They said: By God, certainly, you knew we drew not near making corruption in the region. And we had not been ones who are thieves
They said: What, then, will be the recompense for him if you had been ones who lie
They said: The recompense for it will be that he in whose saddlebag it was located will be the recompense. Thus, we give recompense to the ones who are unjust
So he began with their sacks before the sack of his brother. Again, he pulled it out of his brother’s sack. Thus, We contrived for Joseph. He would not have taken his brother into the judgment of the king unless God wills it. We exalt in degree whomever We will, and above all those possessors of knowledge is One Who is Knowing
They said: If he steals, surely, a brother of his stole before. But Joseph kept it secret within himself, not showing it to them. He said: You are in a worse place. And God is greater in knowledge of what you allege
They said: O the great one! Truly, for him is an old man as his father so take one of us in his place. Truly, we consider thee among the ones who are doers of good
He said: God be my safe place that we take but him with Whom we found our sustenance. Truly, we, then, would be of the ones who are unjust
So when in regard to him they became hopeless, they conferred privately. The eldest of them said: Know you not that your father, surely, took a pledge from you by God and before that you neglected your duty with Joseph. So I will never quit this region until my father gives me permission or God gives judgment in my case. And He is Best of the ones who judge
Return to your father and say: O our father! Truly, thy son stole and we bore witness only to what we knew. And we had not been ones who guard the unseen
And ask the people of the town where we had been and the people of the caravan in which we came forward. And, truly, we are ones who are sincere
He said: You were enticed by your souls into an affair. So patience is graceful. Perhaps God will bring me them altogether. Truly, He, He is The Knowing, The Wise
And he turned away from them and said: O my bitterness for Joseph! And his eyes brightened because of the sorrow that was choking him
They said: By God! Thou wilt never discontinue remembering Joseph until thou hast ruined thy health. Thou wouldst be among the ones who are perishing
He said: I make not complaint of my anguish and sorrow but to God. And I know from God what you know not
O my sons! Go and search for Joseph and his brother. And give not up hope of the solace of God. Truly, no one gives up hope of the solace of God but the folk, ones who are ungrateful
Then, when they entered to him, they said: O the great one! Harm afflicted us and our household. We drew near merchandise of scant worth so live up to the full measure and be charitable to us. Truly, God gives recompense to the ones who give in charity
He said: Knew you what you accomplished with Joseph and his brother when you are ones who are ignorant
They said: Art thou, truly, Joseph? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother. Surely, God showed us grace. Truly, He Who is Godfearing and endures patiently, then, surely, God will not waste the compensation of the ones who are doers of good
They said: By God! Certainly, God held thee in greater favor above us. And, truly, we had been ones who are inequitable
He said: No censure on you this day. God forgive you. And He is One Who is Most Merciful of the ones who are most merciful
Go with this, my long shirt and cast it over the face of my father. He will become seeing. And bring me your household one and all
And when they set forward with the caravan their father said: Truly, I find the scent of Joseph if you think me not weak of mind
They said: By God! Truly, thou art long possessed by thy wandering astray
Then, when the bearer of good tidings drew near, he cast it over his face and he went back, seeing. He said: Did I not say to you, truly, I know from God what you know not
They said: O our father! Ask forgiveness for us for our impieties. Truly, we had been ones who are inequitable
He said: I will ask forgiveness for you with my Lord. Truly, He, He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate
Then, when they entered to Joseph, he gave refuge to his parents and said: Enter Egypt, if God willed, as ones who are safe
And he exalted his parents to the throne. And they fell down before him as ones who prostrate themselves. And he said: O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream from before. My Lord has made it a reality. And, surely, He did good to me when He brought me out of the prison and drew you near out of the desert after Satan had sown enmity between me and between my brothers. Truly, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Truly, He is The Knowing, The Wise
My Lord! Surely, Thou hadst given me of the dominion. Thou hadst taught of the interpretation of events. One Who is Originator of the heavens and the earth, Thou art my protector in the present and in the world to come. Call me to Thyself as one who submits to Thee and cause me to join with the ones in accord with morality
That is of the tidings of the unseen that We reveal to thee. And thou hadst not been in their presence when they agreed to their affair. And they plan
And most of humanity is not ones who believe, even if thou wert eager
Thou hast asked them not for any compensation. It is but a Remembrance to the worlds
And how many signs of the heavens and the earth they pass by while they are ones who turn aside from them
And most of them believe not in God, but they be ones who are polytheists
Were they safe from the approach to them of the overwhelming event of the punishment from God or the approach on them of the Hour suddenly while they are not aware
Say: This is my way. I call to God. I and whoever followed me are on clear evidence. And glory be to God! And I am not among the ones who are polytheists
And We sent not before thee as Messengers, but men to whom We reveal from among the people of the towns. So journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before them? And, truly, the abode of the world to come is better for those who were Godfearing. Will you not, then, be reasonable
When the Messengers became hopeless and thought that they were lied against, then, Our help drew near. So We were to deliver whomever We will. And Our Might will not be repelled from the folk, the ones who sin
Certainly, there had been in their narratives a lesson for those imbued with intuition. It had not been a discourse that is devised except it established as true what was before and decisively explained everything and is a guidance and a mercy for a folk who believe
Alif L[m M\m R[. That are the signs of the Book, and what were caused to descend to thee from thy Lord is The Truth, except most of humanity believes not]
It is He Who exalted the heavens without any pillars so that you see them. Again, He turned his attention to above the Throne. And He caused to become subservient the sun and the moon, each run for a term, that which is determined. He manages the command. He explains distinctly the signs so that perhaps of the meeting with your Lord you would be certain
And it is He Who stretched out the earth and made on it firm mountains and rivers. And with all kinds of fruits, he made in it two, a pair. He covers the nighttime with the daytime. Truly, in that are signs for a folk who reflect
And in the earth there are strips, that which neighbor one another and gardens of grapevines and plowed lands and date palm trees coming from the same root and not coming from the same root that are given to drink from one water. And We give advantage to some of them over some others in produce. Truly, in these things there are signs for a folk who are reasonable
And if thou hast marveled, then, wonder at their saying: When we had been earth dust, will we, truly, be in a new creation? And those are those who were ungrateful to their Lord. Those will have yokes around their necks. And those will be the Companions of the Fire. They, ones who will dwell in it forever
And they seek thee to hasten on evil deeds before the benevolence. And, surely, passed away before them exemplary punishments. But, truly, thy Lord is certainly, The Possessor of Forgiveness for humanity in spite of their injustice. And, truly, thy Lord is Severe in repayment
And those who were ungrateful say: Why was a sign not caused to descend to him from his Lord? Thou art only one who warns, and one who guides every folk
God knows what every female carries and how much her womb absorbs and what they add. And everything with Him is in proportion
He is One Who Knows the unseen and the visible, The Great, The One Who is Raised High
It is equal to Him whether you kept secret his saying or you published it. Or whoever he be, one who conceals himself by nighttime or one who goes about carelessly in the daytime
For him there are Ones Who Postpone from before him and from behind him to keep him safe by the command of God. Truly, God alters not a folk until they alter what is within themselves. And when God wanted evil for a folk, then, there is no turning it back. And there is not for them other than He anyone who is a safeguarder
It is He Who causes you to see the lightning in fear and in hope. And it is He Who causes the clouds to grow heavy
and thunder glorifies His praise and the angels, because of their awe of Him. And He sends thunderbolts and He lights on whom He wills. And they dispute about God, and He is a Severe Force
For Him is the call of The Truth. And those whom they call to other than Him, they respond not to them at all, but like one who stretches out the palms of his hands for water so that it should reach his mouth, but it is not that which reaches it. And supplication of the ones who are ungrateful is only wandering astray
And to God prostrates whatever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly as does their shade at the first part of the day and the eventide.‡
Say: Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: God! Say: Took you to yourselves other than Him protectors? They control not themselves, neither profiting nor hurting. Say: Are the unwilling to see on the same level as the seeing? Are the shadows on the same level as the light? Made they ascribed associates with God who created as His creation so that creation resembled one another to them? Say: God is One Who is Creator of everything. And He is The One, The Omniscient
He caused water to descend from heaven and it flowed into valleys according to their measure. Then, the flood bears away the froth. And from what they kindle in a fire, looking for glitter or sustenance, there is a froth the like of it. Thus, God compares The Truth and falsehood. Then, as for the froth, it goes as swelling scum while what profits humanity abides on the earth. Thus, God propounds parables
For those who responded to their Lord there is the fairer. And for those who respond not to Him, if they had all that is in and on the earth and its like with it, they would offer it as ransom. Those, for them will be a dire reckoning and their place of shelter will be hell. Miserable will be the cradling
Then, is he who knows what was caused to descend to thee from thy Lord to be The Truth like he who is unwilling to see? It is only those imbued with intuition who recollect
Those who live up to their compact with God and break not their solemn promise
and those who reach out to what God commanded be joined and dread their Lord and they fear the dire reckoning
and those who endured patiently, looking for the Countenance of their Lord and who performed the formal prayer and spent out of what We have provided them in secret and in public, and they drive off the evil deed with benevolence—those, for them is the Ultimate Abode
Gardens of Eden which they will enter along with whoever was in accord with morality from among their fathers and their spouses and their offspring. And angels will enter to them from every door saying
Peace be to you for what you endured patiently. How excellent is the Ultimate Abode
But those who break the compact of God after its solemn promise and sever what God commanded to be joined and make corruption in and on the earth, those, for them is the curse and for them is the Dire Abode
God extends the provision for whom He wills and measures it. They were glad in this present life. And there is nothing in this present life like the world to come but a brief enjoyment
And those who were ungrateful say: Why was a sign not caused to descend to him from his Lord? Say: Truly, God causes to go astray whom He wills and guides to Himself whomever was penitent
those who believed and their hearts are at rest in the remembrance of God, no doubt in the remembrance of God hearts are at rest
Those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, there is joy for them and a goodness of destination
Thus, We sent thee to a community. Surely, passed away other communities before it so that thou wouldst recount to them what We revealed to thee and they are ungrateful to The Merciful. Say: He is my Lord. There is no god but He. In Him I put my trust and to Him I am turning in repentance
If there were a Recitation that would have set mountains in motion with it, or the earth would be cut off with it or the dead would be spoken to with it, nay! The command is altogether with God. Do those who believed not have knowledge that if God wills He would have guided humanity altogether. Will cease not to light on those who were ungrateful disaster because of what they crafted? Or will it alight close to their abode until the promise of God approaches? Truly, God breaks not His solemn declaration
And, certainly, Messengers were ridiculed before thee, but I granted indulgence to those who were ungrateful. Again, I took them. How had been My repayment
Is He, then, One Who Sustains Every Soul for what it earned? And yet they ascribe associates with God! Say: Name them! Or will you tell Him of what He knows not in the earth? Or name you only them in the manifest sayings? Nay! Made to appear pleasing to those who were ungrateful was their planning and they were barred from the way. And whomever God causes to go astray, for him there is no one who guides
For them is a punishment in this present life and, certainly, punishment in the world to come will be one that presses hard. And for them is no one who is a defender against God
A parable of the Garden which was promised to the ones who are Godfearing; beneath it rivers run. Its produce is one that continues as is its shade. That is the Ultimate End of those who were Godfearing; and the Ultimate End of the ones who are ungrateful is the fire
And those to whom We gave the Book are glad at what was caused to descend to thee. And there are among the confederates some who reject some of it. Say: I was commanded to worship only God and not to ascribe partners with Him. I call to Him and to Him is my destination
And, thus, We caused to descend an Arabic determination. If thou hadst followed their desires after what drew near thee of the knowledge, thou wouldst not have against God either a protector or one who is a defender
And, certainly, We sent Messengers before thee and We assigned for them spouses and offspring. And it had not been for a Messenger to bring a sign but with the permission of God. For every term there is a Book
God blots out what He wills and brings to a standstill what He wills; and with Him is the essence of the Book
And whether We cause thee to see some of what We have promised them or call thee to Ourselves, on thee is delivering the message and on Us is the reckoning
Consider they not that We approach the earth, reducing it from its outlying parts? And God gives judgment. There is no one who postpones His determination. And He is Swift in reckoning
And, surely, those who were before them planned, but to God is the plan altogether. He knows what every person earns. And the ones who are ungrateful will know for whom will be the Ultimate Abode
And those who were ungrateful say: Thou art not one who is sent. Say: God sufficed as a witness between me and between you and whoever has knowledge of the Book
Alif L[m R[. This is a Book We caused to descend to thee so that thou hast brought humanity out from the shadows into the light with the permission of their Lord to the path of The Almighty, The Worthy of Praise]
God! To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth, and woe to the ones who are ungrateful. For them is the severe punishment
those who embrace this present life instead of the world to come and bar from the way of God, and desire in it crookedness. Those are wandering far astray
We sent not any Messenger but with the tongue of his folk in order that he make it manifest for them. Then, God causes to go astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
And, certainly, We sent Moses with Our signs saying: Bring out thy folk from the shadows into the light and remind them of the Days of God. Truly, in that are signs for every enduring, grateful one
And mention when Moses said to his folk: Remember the divine blessing of God to you when He rescued you from the people of Pharaoh who cause an affliction to befall you—a dire punishment—and slaughter your children and save alive your women. And in it was a serious trial from your Lord
And mention when your Lord caused to be proclaimed: If you gave thanks, I will increase your blessings. And if you were ungrateful, truly, My punishment will be severe
And Moses said: Even if you are ungrateful, you and what is in and on the earth altogether, then, truly, God is Sufficient, Worthy of Praise
Approach not to you the tidings of those before you: The folk of Noah and Ad and Thamud and of those after them. None knows them but God. Their Messengers drew near them with the clear portents, but they shoved their hands into their mouths in denial. Then, they said: Truly, we disbelieved in what you were sent and we are in uncertainty about that to which you call us. We are in grave doubt
Their Messengers said: Is there any uncertainty about God, One Who is Originator of the heavens and the earth? He calls you so that He would forgive you your impieties and postpone for you a term, that which is determined. They said: You are only mortal like us. You want to bar us from what our fathers had been worshipping. Then, bring us a clear authority
Their Messengers said to them: We are only mortals like you except God shows His grace on whom He wills of His servants. And it had not been for us that we bring you an authority, but by the permission of God. And in God let the ones who believe put their trust
And why should we not put our trust in God while, surely, He guided us to our ways? And we will endure patiently however you maligned us. And in God let the ones who trust, put their trust
And those who were ungrateful said to their Messengers: Certainly, we will drive you out of our region unless you revert to our creed. So their Lord revealed to them: Truly, We will cause to perish the ones who are unjust
Certainly, We will cause you to dwell in the region after them. This is for whoever feared My station and feared My threat
And the Messengers sought judgment and frustrated was every haughty, stubborn one
And hell is ahead of him. He will be given to drink of watery pus
He will gulp it and he will be about to swallow it easily when death will approach him from every place, yet he will not be dead. And ahead of him will be a harsh punishment
A parable of those who were ungrateful to their Lord, their actions are as ashes over which the wind blew strongly on a tempestuous day. They will have no power over anything they earned. That is the wandering far away, astray
Hast thou not considered that God created the heavens and the earth in Truth? If He wills, He will cause you to be put away and bring a new creation
And that is not a great matter for God
And they will depart to God altogether. Then, the weak would say to those who grew arrogant: Truly, we had been followers of yours. Have you ones who avail us at all against the punishment of God? They would say: If God would have guided us, we would have guided you. It is equal to us whether we were patientless or endured patiently. There is no asylum for us
Satan would say when the command would be decided: Truly, God promised you a promise of the Truth. And I promised you, but I broke it. And I had been no authority over you, but that I called to you and you responded to me. So blame me not, but blame yourselves. I am not one who assists you nor are you one who assists me. Truly, I was ungrateful for your ascribing me as partner with God before. Truly, the ones who are unjust, for them is a painful punishment
And will be caused to enter those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality into Gardens beneath which rivers run. They, ones who will dwell in them forever with the permission of their Lord. And their greeting in it will be: Peace
Hast thou not considered how God propounded a parable? What is like a good word is what is like a good tree. Its root is one that is firm and its branches are in heaven
It gives all its produce for a while with the permission of its Lord. And God propounds parables for humanity so that perhaps they will recollect
And the parable of a bad word is that of a bad tree, that was uprooted from above the earth, so it has no stability
God makes firm those who believed with the saying, one that is firm in this present life and in the world to come. And God will cause to go astray the ones who are unjust. And God accomplishes what He wills
Hast thou not considered those who substituted ingratitude for the divine blessing of God and caused their folk to live in abodes of nothingness
They will roast in hell. Miserable will be the stopping place
And they made rivals with God, causing others to go astray from His way. Say: Take joy, but, truly, your homecoming is the fire
Say to My servants who believed that they should perform the formal prayer and spend from what We provided them secretly and in public before a Day approaches in which there is neither trading nor befriending
God is He Who created the heavens and the earth and caused water to descend from heaven and brought out thereby fruits as provision for you. And He caused boats to be subservient to you that they run through the sea by His command. And He caused rivers to be subservient to you
And He caused the sun to be subservient to you and the moon, both, ones that are constant in their work. And He caused the nighttime to be subservient to you and the daytime
And He gave you all that you asked of Him. And if you were to number the divine blessing of God, you would not count them, truly, the human being is wrongdoing and an ingrate
And when Abraham said: My Lord! Make this land that which is safe and cause me and my children to turn away from worshipping idols
My Lord! Truly, they caused to go astray many among humanity; so whoever heeded me, truly, he is of me. And whoever rebelled against me, then Thou art, truly, Forgiving, Compassionate
Our Lord! Truly, I caused to dwell some of my offspring in an unsown valley by Thy Holy House, O our Lord, they, certainly, perform the formal prayer. So make the minds among humanity yearn for them and provide them with fruits so that perhaps they will give thanks
Our Lord! Truly, Thou hast known what we conceal and what we speak openly. And nothing is hidden from God in or on the earth or in heaven
The Praise belongs to God Who bestowed on me in my old age Ishmael and Isaac. And, truly, my Lord is Hearing the supplication
My Lord! Make me one who performs the formal prayer and from my offspring also. Our Lord! Receive my supplication
Our Lord! Forgive Thou me and the ones who are my parents and the ones who believe on the Day the reckoning arises
And assume not that God is One Who is Heedless of what the ones who are unjust do. He only postpones their reckoning to a Day when their sight will be fixed in horror
ones who run forward with eyes fixed in horror, ones who lift up their heads. Their glance goes not back to them. And their minds are void
And warn humanity of a Day the punishment will approach them. So those who did wrong will say: Our Lord! Postpone for us a near term so that we answer Thy call and follow the Messengers. Yet swore you not an oath before that there would be no ceasing for you
And you inhabited the dwellings of those who did wrong to themselves. And it became clear to you how We accomplished against them and We propounded for you parables
And, surely, they planned their plan and their plan was with God, even if their plan had been to displace mountains
So assume not that God will be one who breaks His promise to His Messengers. Truly, God is Almighty, Possessor of Requital
On a Day when the earth will be substituted for other than this earth and the heavens, they will depart to God, The One, The Omniscient God
and thou wilt consider the ones who sin that Day, ones who are chained in bonds
their tunics are made of pitch and the fire will overcome their faces
so that God would give recompense to every soul for what it earned. Truly, God is Swift in reckoning
This is the delivering of the message to humanity so that they be warned by it and that they know that He is One God so that those imbued with intuition recollect
Alif L[m R[. That are the signs of the Book and of a clear Recitation]
It may be those who were ungrateful would wish that they had been ones who submit to God
Forsake them to eat and let them take joy and be diverted with hopefulness. Then, they will know
And We caused not a town to perish but there was for it a known prescription
No community precedes its term nor delays it
And they say: O thou to whom was sent down the Remembrance, truly, thou art one who is possessed
Why hast thou not brought angels to us if thou hadst been the ones who are sincere
We send angels down not but with The Truth. If they come to the ungrateful, they would not have been ones who are given respite
Truly, We, We sent down the Remembrance and, truly, We are ones who guard it
And, certainly, We sent Messengers before thee to partisans of the ancient ones
And approach them not any Messenger but they had been ridiculing him
Thus, We thrust it into the hearts of the ones who sin
They believe not in it. Surely, passed away before them a custom of the ancient ones
And even if We opened for them a door from heaven and they continued going up to it
they would say: Truly, our sight was dazzled. Nay! We were a bewitched folk
And, certainly, We made constellations in the heavens and We made them appear pleasing to the ones who look
And We kept them safe from every accursed satan
but he who had the ability to hear by eavesdropping. Then, a clear flame pursued him
And We stretched out the earth and We cast on it firm mountains and We caused to develop on it that which was well-balanced of everything
And We made on it for you a livelihood and for whomever you are not ones who provide
And there is not a thing, but its treasures are with Us and We send it down not but in a known measure
And We sent fertilizing winds. Then, We caused water to descend from heaven, then, We satiated you, and you are not ones who are its keepers
And, truly, it is We Who give life and cause to die and We are the ones who inherit
And, certainly, We knew the ones who precede among you and, certainly, We knew the ones who come later
And, truly, thy Lord is He Who assembles. Truly, He is Wise, Knowing
And, certainly, We created the human being out of earth-mud of soft wet earth
And We created the ones who are spirits before from the fire of a burning wind
And mention when thy Lord said to the angels: Truly, I am One Who is Creator of mortals out of earth-mud of soft wet earth
That is when I shaped him and breathed into him of My Spirit. So fall down before him as ones who prostrate themselves
The angels prostrated themselves, one and all
but Iblis. He refused to be with the ones who prostrate themselves
He said: O Iblis! What is with thee that thou be not with the ones who prostrate themselves
Iblis said: I will not be prostrating myself before a mortal whom Thou hadst created out of earth-mud of soft wet earth
It was said: Go thou forth from here, for, truly, thou art accursed
And, truly, a curse will be upon thee until the Day of Judgment
Iblis said: O my Lord! Give me respite until the Day they are raised up
He said: Then, truly, thou art among the ones who are given respite
until the Day of the known time
Iblis said: My Lord! Because Thou hadst led me into error I will, certainly, make the earth appear pleasing to them and I will lead them one and all into error
but Thy servants among them, the ones who are devoted
He said: This is the straight path to Me
Truly, as for My servants there is no authority for thee over them, but ones who are in error followed thee
And, truly, hell is promised to them one and all
It has seven doors. Then, for every one, a door set apart, is for them
Truly, the ones who are Godfearing will be amidst gardens and springs
Enter them in peace as ones who are safe
And We will tear out any grudges from their breasts. They will be as brothers/sisters on couches, one facing the other
In it neither fatigue will afflict them nor will they be ones who are driven out
Tell My servants that I am The Forgiving, The Compassionate
and that My punishment, it is a painful punishment
And tell them about the guests of Abraham
when they entered upon him and said: Peace! He said: Truly, we are afraid of you
They said: Take no notice. Truly, we give thee good tidings of a knowing boy
He said: Gave you good tidings to me even though old age afflicted me? So of what give you good tidings
They said: We gave thee good tidings of The Truth, so thou art not of the ones who despair
He said: Who despairs of the mercy of his Lord, but the ones who go astray
He said: Then, what is your business, O the ones who are sent
They said: We were sent to a folk, ones who sin
but the family of Lot. Truly, we are ones who will deliver them one and all
but his woman. We ordained that she be of the ones who stay behind
Then, when the ones who are sent drew near the people of Lot
he said: Truly, you are folk, ones unlawful to me
They said: Nay! We drew near thee with what they had been contesting in it
We approached thee with The Truth and, truly, we are ones who are sincere
Then, set forth with thy family in a part of the night and follow thou their backs and look not back any of you, but pass on to where you are commanded
And We decreed the command to him that the last remnant of these would be that which is severed, in that which is morning
The people of the city drew near rejoicing at the good tidings
Lot said: Truly, these are my guests, so put me not to shame
Be Godfearing of God and cover me not with shame
They said: Prohibit we thee not from some beings
Lot said: These are my daughters if you hadst been ones who do something
By thy life, truly, they were in a daze, wandering unwilling to see
So the Cry took them at sunrise
And We made its high part low and We rained down on them rocks of baked clay
Truly, in this are signs for the ones who read marks
And, truly, they are ones who are on an abiding way
Truly, in it is a sign for the ones who believe
And, truly, the Companions of the Thicket had been ones who are unjust
so We requited them and they were both on a clear high road
Certainly, the Companions of the Rocky Tract denied the ones who are sent
And We gave them Our signs. Then, they had been ones who turn aside from them
And they had been carving out safe houses from mountains
but the Cry took them in that which is morning
And availed them not what they had been earning
And We created not the heavens and the earth and whatever is in between them but with The Truth. And, truly, the Hour is one that arrives. So overlook with a graceful overlooking
Truly, thy Lord is The Knowing Creator
And, certainly, We gave thee seven often repeated parts of the sublime Quran
And stretch not out thy eyes for what We gave of enjoyment in this life to spouses among them, nor feel remorse for them, but make low thy wing in kindness to the ones who believe
And say: Truly, I am a clear warner
even as We caused to descend on the ones who are partitioners
those who made the Quran into fragments
So by thy Lord, We will, certainly, ask them one and all
about what they had been doing
So call aloud what thou art commanded: Turn aside from the ones who are polytheists
Truly, We sufficed thee against the ones who ridicule
those who make with God another god. But they will know
And, certainly, We know that thy breast became narrowed, injured in spirit, because of what they say
So glorify the praises of thy Lord and be among the ones who prostrate themselves
and worship thy Lord until the certainty approaches thee
Approached the command of God? Seek not to hasten it. Glory be to Him and exalted is He above partners they ascribe with God
He sends down the angels with the Spirit of His command on whom He wills of His servants to warn that there is no god but I, so be Godfearing of Me
He created the heavens and the earth with The Truth. Exalted is He above partners they ascribe
He created the human being from seminal fluid. That is when he is a clear adversary
And He created the flocks, for you in which there is warmth and profits and of them you eat
and in them is a beauty for you when you give them rest and when you drive forth flocks to pasture
And they carry your lading to a land, being that which reaches you not but under adverse circumstances to yourselves. Truly, your Lord is Gentle, Compassionate
And He creates horses, mules and donkeys for you to ride and as an adornment. And He creates what you know not
And with God is showing of the way yet some of them are ones who swerve. If He willed, He would have guided you one and all
It is He Who caused water to descend from heaven for you to drink from it and from it, trees wherein you pasture your herds
He caused crops to develop for you with it, and the olives and the date palms and the grapevines, and all kinds of fruits. Truly, in that is a sign for a folk who reflect
And He caused to be subservient to you the nighttime and the daytime and the sun and the moon, and the stars, ones caused to be subservient by His command. Truly, in that are signs for a folk who are reasonable
And whatever He made numerous for you in and on the earth of hues, ones that are at variance, truly, in that is a sign for a folk who recollect
And He it is Who caused the sea to be subservient to you so that you eat from it succulent flesh and pull out of it glitter to wear and thou seest the boats, ones that plow through the waves, that you be looking for His grace and so that perhaps you will give thanks
And He cast on to the earth firm mountains so that it not vibrate with you and rivers and roads so that perhaps you will be truly guided
and landmarks. And they are truly guided by the stars
Is, then, He Who creates as he who creates not? Will you not, then, recollect
And if you try to number the divine blessing of God, you will not be able to count it. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
And God knows what you keep secret and what you speak openly
And those whom you call to other than God, they created not anything but they are themselves created
They are lifeless, not living. And they are not aware when they will be raised up
Your God is One God. But for those who believe not in the world to come, their hearts are ones that know not and they are ones who grow arrogant
Without a doubt God knows what they keep secret and what they speak openly. Truly, He loves not the ones who grow arrogant
And when it is said to them: What is that your Lord caused to descend, they would say: Fables of the ancient ones
They will carry their own heavy loads, that which is complete, on the Day of Resurrection, and of the heavy loads of whomever they cause to go astray without knowledge. How evil is what they will bear
Surely, those who were before them planned, then, God approached their structures from the foundations and the roof fell down upon them from above and the punishment approached them from where they are not aware
Again, on the Day of Resurrection He will cover them with shame and will say: Where are My ascribed associates with whom you had been making a breach with them? Those who were given the knowledge will say: Truly, degradation this Day and evil upon the ones who are ungrateful
Those whom the angels call to themselves while they are ones who are unjust to themselves. Then, they will give a proposal of surrender: We had not been doing any evil. Yea! Truly, God is Knowing of what you had been doing
So enter the doors of hell—ones who will dwell in it forever; and, certainly, it will be a miserable place of lodging. It is for the ones who increase in pride
And when it was said to those who were Godfearing: What is it that your Lord caused to descend? They will say: Good or for those who did good in the present, there is benevolence. And the abode of the world to come is better. And how excellent will be the abode of the ones who are Godfearing
Gardens of Eden which they will enter beneath which rivers run. They have in them all that they will. Thus, God gives recompense to the ones who are Godfearing
Those whom the angels call to themselves while they are ones who are good. They say to them: Peace be unto you! Enter the Garden because of what you had been doing
Look they not on but that the angels approach them or the command of thy Lord approach? Thus, accomplished those before them. And God did not wrong them. Rather, they had been doing wrong to themselves
Then, their evil deeds lit on them for what their hands did. And surrounded them is what they had been ridiculing
And those who ascribed partners with God said: If God willed neither would we have worshiped other than Him anything, we nor our fathers, nor would we have held sacred anything other than what He forbade. Thus, accomplished those who were before them. Then, what is upon the Messengers, but the delivering of the clear message
And, certainly, We raised up in every community a Messenger saying that: Worship God and avoid false deities. Then, of them were some whom God guided and of them were some upon whom their fallacy was realized. So journey through the earth; then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who deny
If thou be eager for their guidance, then, truly, God will not guide whom He causes to go astray. And they will have no ones who help
And they swore by God their most earnest oaths: God will not raise up him who dies. Yea! It is a promised obligation upon Him—except most of humanity knows not—
in order to make manifest for them about what they are at variance in it and so that those who were ungrateful know that they had been ones who lie
Our saying to a thing when We wanted it is that We say to it: Be! Then, it is
As for those who emigrated for God after they were wronged, We will, certainly, have a place of settlement for them with benevolence in the present. And the compensation of the world to come will be greater, if they had been knowing
Those who endured patiently, they put their trust in their Lord
And We sent not before thee but men to whom We reveal revelation. So ask the People of Remembrance if you had not been knowing
With the clear portents and the ancient scrolls, We caused to descend the Remembrance to thee that thou wilt make manifest to humanity what was sent down to them and so that perhaps they will reflect
Were those who planned evil deeds safe that God will not cause the earth to swallow them or that the punishment will not approach them from where they are not aware
Or that He take them in their going to and fro where they will not be ones who frustrate Him
Or that He take them, destroying them little by little? Truly, thy Lord is Gentle, Compassionate
Consider they not that whatever things God created casts its shadow to the right and to the left, ones who prostrate themselves to God. And they are ones in a state of lowliness
And to God prostrates whatever is in the heavens and all that is in and on the earth of moving creatures and the angels and they grow not arrogant
They fear their Lord above them and accomplish what they are commanded.‡
And God said: Take not two gods to yourselves. Truly, He is One God. Then, have reverence for Me
And to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth and His is the way of life, that which is forever. Are you Godfearing of other than God
And whatever you have of divine blessing is from God. After that when harm afflicted you, you make entreaties to Him
Again, when He removed the harm from you, that is when a group of people among you ascribe partners with their Lord
They are ungrateful for what We gave them. So let them take joy. They will know
And they assign to what they know not a share from what We provided them. By God! You will, certainly, be asked about what you had been devising
And they assign daughters to God! Glory be to Him! And for themselves, that for which they lust
And when any of them was given good tidings of a female, his face stayed one that is clouded over and he chokes
He is secluded from the folk because of the dire tidings he was given. Will he hold it back with humiliation or will he trample it in the earth dust? Truly, how evil is the judgment they give
For those who believe not in the world to come there is the reprehensible evil description while the loftiest description belongs to God. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
And if God were to take humanity to task for their injustice, He would not leave on it a moving creature. Rather, He postpones them for a term, that is determined. And when their term drew near, neither will they delay it an hour, nor press it forward
And they assign to God what they dislike. Their tongues allege the lie that the fairer things will be theirs. Without a doubt, for them is the fire, and they will be ones made to hasten to it
By God! We, certainly, sent Messengers to communities before thee. Satan made their actions appear pleasing to them. So he is their protector on this Day and theirs will be a painful punishment
And We caused the Book to descend to thee, but that thou wilt make manifest to them those things in which they were at variance in it and as a guidance and a mercy for a folk who believe
And God caused water to descend from heaven and from it gave life to the earth after its death. Truly, in this is a sign for a folk who hear
And, truly, for you in the flocks is a lesson. We satiate you from what is in their bellies—between waste and blood—exclusively milk, that which is delicious to the ones who drink
From fruits of the date palm trees and grapevines you take to yourselves of it what obscures the mind and fairer provisions. Truly, in it is a sign for a folk who be reasonable
And thy Lord revealed to thee the bee: Take to thyself houses from the mountains and in the trees and in what they construct
Again, eat of all the fruits and insert thyself submissively into the ways of thy Lord. Drink goes forth from their bellies in hues, ones that are at variance, wherein is healing for humanity. Truly, in this is, certainly, a sign for a folk who reflect
And God created you. Again, He calls you to Himself. And of you there are some who are returned to the most wretched of lifetimes so that he knows nothing after having knowledge of something. Truly, God is Knowing, Powerful
God gave advantage to some of you over some others in provision. But those who were given advantage are not ones who give over their provision to what their right hands possessed so that they are equal in it. Why negate they the divine blessing of God
And God assigned to you spouses (f) of your own kind and has assigned you from your spouses (f), children and grandchildren and provided you with what is good. Believe they, then, in falsehood and are ungrateful for the divine blessing of God
They worship other than God what has no sway, no power to provide for them anything from the heavens and the earth, nor are they able to do so
So propound not parables for God. Truly, God Knows and you know not
God propounded a parable of a chattel servant who has no power over anything and one to whom We provided from Us a fairer provision. And he spends from it secretly and openly publishing it. Are they on the same level? The Praise belongs to God. Nay! Most of them know not
And God propounded a parable of two men, one of them unwilling to speak. He has no power over anything and he is a heavy burden to his defender. Whichever way he turns his face, he brings no good. Is he on the same level as the one who commands justice and he who is on a straight path
And to God belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth. And the command of the Hour is not but the twinkling of an eye to one’s sight or it is nearer. Truly, God is Powerful over everything
And God brought you out from the wombs of your mothers and you know nothing. And He assigned to you the ability to hear and sight and mind so that perhaps you will give thanks
Consider you not the birds, the ones caused to be subservient in the firmament of the heavens? None holds them back but God. Truly, in this are the signs for a folk who believe
And God assigned for you your houses as places of comfort and rest and assigned for you the hides of flocks for your houses which you find light on the day of your departure and the day of your halting and of their wool and furs and hair— furnishing and enjoyment for a while
And God made for you shade out of what He created and made for you the mountains as a refuges in the time of need and has made for you tunics to protect you from the heat and tunics to protect you from your violence. Thus, He fulfills His divine blessing to you so that perhaps you will submit to God
Then, if they turned away, for thee is only the delivering of the clear message
They recognize the divine blessing of God. Again, they reject it and most of them are the ones who are ungrateful
On the Day We will raise up from every community a witness again, no permission will be given to those who are ungrateful nor will they ask to be favored
And when those who did wrong consider the punishment, then, it will not be lightened for them nor will they be given respite
And when those who ascribed partners saw their ascribed associates with God, they will say: Our Lord, these are our ascribed associates whom we had been calling to other than Thee. Then, they will cast their saying back to them: Truly, you are ones who lie
They will give a proposal to God on that day of surrender. Gone astray from them will be what they had been devising
Those who were ungrateful and barred from the way of God, We increased them in punishment above their punishment because they had been making corruption
On the Day We raise up in every community a witness against them from among themselves and We will bring thee about as a witness against these. And We sent down to thee the Book as an exposition that makes everything clear and as a guidance and as a mercy and as good tidings for the ones who submit to God
Truly, God commands justice and kindness and giving to one who is a possessor of kinship and He prohibits depravity and ones who are unlawful and insolent. He admonishes you so that perhaps you will recollect
And live up to the compact of God when you have made a contract. And break not the oaths after ratification. And, surely, you made God surety over you. Truly, God knows what you accomplish
And be not like she who would break what she spun after firming its fibers by taking to yourselves your oaths in mutual deceit among yourselves so that one community be one that is swelling more than another community. God tries you but by this. And He will make manifest to you on the Day of Resurrection about what you had been at variance in it
If God willed, He would have made you one community, but He causes to go astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And, certainly, you will be asked about what you had been doing
Take not your oaths to yourselves in mutual deceit among yourselves, that your footing should not backslide after standing firm and you experience the evil of having barred from the way of God. And for you will be a serious punishment
And exchange not the compact for a little price. Truly, what is with God is better for you if you had been knowing
Whatever is with you will come to an end. And whatever is with God is that which endures. And We will, certainly, give recompense to those who endured patiently their fairer compensation for what they had been doing
Whoever does as one in accord with morality, whether male or female, while being one who believes, We will give life—this good life. And We will give recompense to them—their compensation—for the fairer for what they had been doing
So when thou hadst recited the Quran, seek refuge with God from the accursed Satan
Truly, he is not an authority over those who believed and in their Lord they put their trust
His authority is only over those who turn away to him and they, those are ones who are polytheists
And when We substituted a sign in place of another sign—and God is greater in knowledge of what He sends down—they said: Thou art only one who devises! But most of them know not
Say: The hallowed Spirit sent it down from thy Lord with The Truth to make firm those who believed and as a guidance and good tidings to the ones who submit to God
And, certainly, We know that they say: It is only a mortal who teaches him. The tongue of him whom they hint at is non-Arab, while this is in a clear Arabic tongue
Truly, those who believe not in the signs of God, God will not guide them and for them is a painful punishment
Devising falsity is only by those who believe not in the signs of God. And those, they are the ones who lie
Whoever disbelieved in God after his belief—other than whoever was compelled to do it against his will while his heart is one that is at peace in belief—but whoever’s breast is expanded to disbelief, on them is the anger of God and for them is a serious punishment
That is because they embraced this present life instead of the world to come. And God guides not the folk, the ones who disbelieve
those are those who God set a seal upon their hearts and upon their ability to hear and their sight. And those, they are the ones who are heedless
Without a doubt they will be in the world to come, the ones who are losers
Again, truly, thy Lord, for those who emigrated after they were persecuted and, again, struggled and endured patiently. Truly, after that, thy Lord is Forgiving, Compassionate
On a Day every soul will approach, disputing for itself and for every soul, its account will be paid in full for what it did they will not be wronged
And God propounded a parable of a town—that which had been safe, one that is at peace, its provision approaches it freely from every place. Then, it was ungrateful for the divine blessings of God and so God caused it to experience extreme hunger and fear because of what they had been crafting
And, certainly, drew near them a Messenger from among them, but they denied him, so the punishment took them while they are ones who are unjust
So eat of what God provided you as lawful, what is good and give thanks for the divine blessing of God if it had been Him that you worship
He only forbade to you carrion and blood and flesh of swine and what was hallowed to other than God. But if one was compelled, without being one who is willfully disobedient, nor one who turns away, then, truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
And say not to what your lying tongues allege: This is lawful and this is unlawful so as to devise lies against God. Truly, those who devise against God lies will not prosper
but a little enjoyment and for them is a painful punishment
We forbade those who became Jews what We related to thee before and We did not wrong them, except they had been doing wrong to themselves
Again, truly, thy Lord—to those who did evil in ignorance, again, repented after that and made things right—truly, thy Lord after that is Forgiving, Compassionate
Abraham had been a community obedient to God—a monotheist—he is not among the ones who are polytheists
He was one who is thankful for His divine blessings. He elected him and guided him to a straight path
And We gave him in the present benevolence. And, truly, in the world to come he will be among the ones in accord with morality
Again, we revealed to thee that thou follow the creed of Abraham—a monotheist. And he had not been among the ones who are polytheists
Truly, the Sabbath was made for those who are at variance about it. Truly, thy Lord will give judgment between them on the Day of Resurrection about what they had been at variance in it
Call thou to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and fairer admonishment. And dispute with them in a way that is fairer. Truly, thy Lord is He Who is greater in knowledge of whoever went astray from His way. And He is greater in knowledge of the ones who are truly guided
And if you chastised, then, chastise with the like of that with which you were chastised. But if you endured patiently, certainly, it is better for the ones who remain steadfast
And have thou patience and thy patience is only from God. And feel not remorse over them, nor be thee troubled about what they plan
Truly, God is with those who were Godfearing and those, they are ones who are doers of good
Glory be to Him Who caused His servant to set forth night from the Masjid al-Haram to the Masjid al-Aqsa around which We blessed so that We cause him to see Our signs. Truly, He, He is The Hearing, The Seeing
And We gave Moses the Book and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel: Take not to yourselves a Trustee other than Me
O offspring of whomever We carried with Noah: Truly, he had been a grateful servant
And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Book: Certainly, you will make corruption in and on the earth two times. And, certainly, you will exalt yourselves in a great self-exaltation
So when the promise drew near for the first of the two, We raised up against you servants of Ours imbued with severe might. They ransacked in the midst of your abodes. And the promise had been one that is accomplished
Again, We returned to you a turn of luck over them and We furnished you relief with children and wealth and made you more in soldiery
If you did good, you would be doing good for yourselves. And if you did evil, then, it is against yourselves. Then, when the last promise drew near, We sent your enemies; they raise anger on your faces and they enter the place of prostration just as they entered it the first time, to shatter all that they ascended to with a shattering
Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you. But if you reverted, We will revert.• And We made hell a jail for the ones who are ungrateful
Truly, this, the Quran, guides to what is upright and gives good tidings to the ones who believe, those who are as the ones in accord with morality, that they will have a great compensation
And as for those who believe not in the world to come, We made ready for them a painful punishment
And the human being calls to worse as much as he supplicates for good. And the human being had been hasty
We made the nighttime and the daytime as two signs. Then, We blotted out the sign of nighttime and We made the sign of daytime for one who perceives that you be looking for grace from your Lord and that you know the number of years and the reckoning. And We explained everything distinctly, with a decisive explanation
For every human being We fastened his omen to his neck and We will bring out for him on the Day of Resurrection a book in which he will meet that which unfolded
Recite thy book! This day thy soul sufficed thee as thy reckoner against thee
Whoever was truly guided is truly guided only for his own soul. And whoever went astray, then, only goes astray against it. And no burdened soul bears the heavy load of another, nor would We have been ones who punish until We raised up a Messenger
And when We wanted to cause a town to perish, We commanded ones who are given ease, but they disobeyed therein. So the saying was realized against it. Then, We destroyed it with utter destruction
How many generations have We caused to perish after Noah? And thy Lord sufficed as Aware, Seeing the impieties of His servants
Whoever had been wanting that which hastens away, We quicken it for him, whatever We will to whomever We want. Again, We assigned hell for him. He will roast in it, one who is condemned, one who is rejected
And whoever wanted the world to come and endeavored for it, endeavoring, while he is one who believes, then, those, their endeavoring had been appreciated
To each We furnish relief, these and these, with the gift of thy Lord. And this gift of thy Lord has not been that which is confined
Look on how We gave advantage to some of them over some others. And, certainly, the world to come will be greater in degrees and greater in excellence
Assign not another god with God for, then, thou wilt be put as one who is condemned, one who is damned
And thy Lord decreed that you worship none but Him! And kindness to the ones who are one’s parents. If they reach old age with thee—one of them or both of them—then, thou wilt not say to them a word of disrespect nor scold them, but say a generous saying to them
And make thyself low to them, the wing of the sense of humility through mercy. And say: O my Lord! Have mercy on them even as they raised me when I was small
Your Lord is greater in knowledge of what is within yourselves. If you be ones in accord with morality, truly, He is Forgiving to those who had been penitent
And give to the possessor of kinship his right and to the needy and to the traveler of the way. And spend not extravagantly an extravagant spending
Truly, the ones who spend extravagantly had been brothers/sisters of the satans and Satan had been ungrateful to his Lord
And if thou hast turned aside from them, looking for mercy from thy Lord for which thou hast hoped, then, say to them a saying softly
And make not thy hand be one that is restricted to thy neck as a miser nor extend it to its utmost expansion as a prodigal so that thou wilt sit as one who is reproached, one who is denuded
Truly, thy Lord extends the provision for whom He wills and He tightens for whom He wills. Truly, He, He had been Aware, Seeing of His servants
And kill not your children dreading want. We will provide for them and for you. Truly, the killing of them had been a grave inequity
And come not near committing adultery. Truly, it had been a great indecency! How evil a way
And kill not a soul that God forbade, but rightfully. And whoever was slain as one who is treated unjustly, surely, We assigned for his protector, authority, but he should not exceed all bounds in killing. Truly, he would be one who is helped by the Law
And come not near the property of the orphan, but with what is fairer until he reaches the coming of age. And live up to the compact. Truly, the compact had been that which will be asked about
And live up to the full measure when you wanted to measure. And weigh with a scale, one that is straight. That is best and fairer in interpretation
And follow up not of what there is not for thee knowledge of it. Truly, having the ability to hear and sight and mind, each of those will have been that which is asked
And walk not on the earth exultantly. Truly, thou wilt never make a hole in the earth and wilt never reach the mountains in height
All of that had been bad deeds, ones that are disliked by thy Lord
That is of what thy Lord revealed to thee of wisdom. So make not up with God another god that thou wouldst be cast down into hell as one who is reproached, as one who is rejected
Selected your Lord for you sons and taken for Himself females from among the angels? Truly, you, you say a serious saying
And, certainly, We diversified in this, the Quran, that they recollect. And it increases them only in aversion
Say: If there had been gods along with Him as they say, then, they would, certainly, be looking for a way to the Possessor of the Throne
Glory be to Him! And exalted is He above what they say, greatly exalted
The seven heavens glorify Him and the earth and whatever is in and on them. There is not a thing but it glorifies His praise, except you understand not their glorification. Truly, He had been Forbearing, Forgiving
And when thou hadst recited the Quran, We made between thee and between those who believe not in the world to come a partition obstructing their vision
And We laid sheaths on their hearts so that they not understand it and heaviness in their ears. And when thou hadst remembered thy Lord in the Quran that He is One, they turned their backs in aversion
We are greater in knowledge of what they listen for when they listen to thee. And when they conspire secretly, when the ones who are unjust say: You follow but a bewitched man
Look on how they propounded parables for thee. So they went astray and they are not able to be on a way
And they say: When we had been bones and broken bits will we be ones who are raised up in a new creation
Say: Should you be rocks or iron
or any creation that is more troublesome in your breasts to raise up? Then, they will say: Who will cause us to return? Say: He Who originated you the first time. Then, they will nod their heads at thee and say: When will it be? Say: Perhaps it is near
It will be a Day when He will call to you and you will respond to Him with His praise and you will think that you lingered in expectation but a little
And say to My servants they should say what is fairer. Truly, Satan sows enmity among them. Truly, Satan had been to the human being, a clear enemy
Your Lord is greater in knowledge of you. If He wills, He will have mercy on you. And if He wills, He will punish you. And We sent thee not as a trustee over them
And thy Lord is greater in knowledge of whoever are in the heavens and in and on the earth. And, certainly, We gave advantage to some of the Prophets over others. And to David We gave Psalms
Say: Call to those whom you claimed other than Him. Then, they are neither in control to remove harm from you nor revise it
Those are those to whom they call to, they are looking for an approach to their Lord—whoever is nearer—and they hope for His mercy and they fear His punishment. Truly, the punishment of thy Lord had been one to beware
And there is not a town but We will be ones who cause it to perish before the Day of Resurrection, or We will be ones who punish it with a severe punishment— that which had been inscribed in the Book
And nothing prevented Us from sending the signs, but that the ancient ones denied them. And We gave to Thamud the she-camel—the one who perceives—but they did wrong to her. And We send not the signs, but as a deterrence
And mention when We said to thee: Truly, thy Lord enclosed humanity. And We made not the dream that We caused thee to see, but as a test for humanity—and the tree—one that was cursed in the Quran. And We frighten them, but it only increases them in great defiance
And mention when We said to the angels: Prostrate yourselves to Adam! so they prostrated themselves, but Iblis. He said: Will I prostrate myself to one whom Thou hadst created from clay
He said: Hadst Thou considered this whom Thou hadst held in esteem above me? If Thou hadst postponed for me to the Day of Resurrection, I will, certainly, bring under full control his offspring, but a few
He said: Go thou! And whoever of them heeded thee, then, truly, hell will be your recompense, an ample recompense
And hound whom thou wert able to of them with thy voice and rally against them with thy horses and thy foot soldiers and share with them in their wealth and children and promise them. And Satan promises them nothing but delusion
Truly, My servants, over them there is no authority for thee. And thy Lord sufficed as a Trustee
Your Lord is He Who propels for you the boats on the sea so that you be looking for His grace. Truly, He had been Compassionate towards you
And when harm afflicted you upon the sea, whomever you call to besides Him went astray. But when He delivered you to dry land, you turned aside. And the human being had been ungrateful
Were you safe that He causes not the shore of dry land to swallow you up or send a sand storm against you? Again, you will find no trustee for you
Or were you safe that He will not cause you to return to it another time and send against you a hurricane of wind and drown you because you were ungrateful? Again, you will not find for yourselves an advocate against Us in it
And, certainly, We held the Children of Adam in esteem. And We carried them on dry land and on the sea and provided them with what is good. And We gave them advantage over many of whomever We created with excellence
On a Day when We will call to every clan with their leader, then, whoever was given his book in his right hand, those will recite their book and they will not be wronged in the least
And whoever had been unwilling to see here will be unseeing in the world to come and one who goes astray from the way
And, truly, they were about to persecute thee for what We revealed to thee so that thou wouldst devise against Us other than it. And, then, they would take thee to themselves as a friend
And if We made thee not firm, certainly, thou wast about to incline to them a little
And, then, We would have caused thee to experience a double of this life and a double after dying. Again, thou wouldst find for thyself no helper against Us
They were about to hound thee from the region that they drive thee out of it. Then, they would not linger in expectation behind thee but for a little while
This is, surely, a custom with whomever We sent before thee of Our Messengers. And thou wilt not find in Our custom any revision
Perform the formal prayer from the sinking sun until the darkening of the night and the recital at dawn. Truly, the dawn recital had been one that is witnessed
And keep vigil with it in the night as a work of supererogation for thee. Perhaps thy Lord will raise thee up to a station of one who is praised
And say: My Lord! Cause me to enter a gate in sincerity. And bring me out as one who is brought out in sincerity. And assign me from that which proceeds from Thy Presence a helping authority
And say: The Truth drew near and falsehood is vanishing! Truly, falsehood had been made to vanish away
We send down in the Quran what is a healing and a mercy for the ones who believe. And it increases not the ones who are unjust, but in a loss
And when We were gracious to the human being, he turned aside and withdrew aside. And when worse afflicted him, he had been hopeless
Say: Each does according to his same manner. And thy Lord is greater in knowledge of him who is better guided on the way
And they will ask thee about the spirit. Say: The spirit is of the command of my Lord. And you were not given the knowledge but a little
And if We willed, We would, certainly, take away what We revealed to thee. Again, thou wouldst not find for thee in that any trustee against Us
but a mercy from thy Lord. Truly, His grace had been great upon thee
Say: If humankind were gathered together and jinn to bring the like of this Quran, they would not approach the like of it even if some of them had been sustainers of some others
And, certainly, We diversified for humanity in this, the Quran, every kind of parable, but most of humanity refused all but disbelief
And they would say: We will never believe in thee until thou hast a fountain gush out of the earth for us
Or will there be a garden for thee of date palms and grapevines and Thou hast caused rivers to gush forth in its midst with a gushing forth
Or hast thou caused heaven to drop on us in pieces as thou hadst claimed? Or hast thou brought God and the angels as a warranty
Or is there a house of ornament for thee? Or hast thou ascended up into heaven? And we will not believe in thy ascension until thou hast sent down for us a Book that we recite. Say: Glory be to my Lord! Had I been but a mortal Messenger
And nothing prevented humanity from believing when the guidance drew near them, but that they said: Raised God up a mortal as a Messenger
Say: If there had been angels on earth walking around, ones who are at peace, then, We would certainly have sent down for them from heaven an angel as a Messenger
Say: God sufficed as a Witness between me and between you. Truly, He had been of His servants Aware, Seeing
And he whom God guides is one who is truly guided. And whomever He causes to go astray, thou wilt never find for them protectors other than Him. And We will assemble them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, unseeing and unspeaking and unhearing. Their place of shelter will be hell. Whenever it declined, We will increase the blaze for them
That is their recompense because they were ungrateful for Our signs. And they said: When we had been bones and broken bits, will we be ones who are raised up as a new creation
Consider they not God Who created the heavens and the earth is One Who Has Power to create the like of them? And He assigned a term for them whereof there is no doubt in it, but the ones who are unjust refused all but disbelief
Say: If you possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, then, you would hold back for dread of spending. And the human being had been ever stingy
And, certainly, We gave Moses nine signs, clear portents. Then, ask the Children of Israel when he drew near them. Then Pharaoh said to him: Truly, O Moses, I think that thou art one who is bewitched
He said: Certainly, thou knewest no one caused these to descend but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear evidence. And, truly, O Pharaoh, I think that thou be one who is accursed
So he wanted to hound them in the region, but We drowned him and those who were with him altogether
And We said to the Children of Israel after him: Inhabit the region. So when drew near the promise of the world to come, We will bring you about a mixed group
And We caused it to descend with The Truth. And it came down with the Truth. And We sent it not to thee, but as one who gives good tidings and as a warner
And it is a Recitation. We separated it in order that thou recitest it to humanity at intervals. And We sent it down a sending successively down
Say: Believe in it, or believe not. Truly, those who were given the knowledge before it, when it is recounted to them, they fall down on their visages, ones who prostrate
And they say: Glory be to our Lord! Truly, the promise of our Lord had been one that is accomplished
And they fall down on their visage weeping. And it increases them in humility.‡
Say: Call to God or call to the Merciful. By whatever you call Him, to Him are the Fairer Names. And be thou not loud in thy formal prayer nor speak in a low tone and look for a way between
And say: The Praise belongs to God Who takes not a son to Himself and there be no associates ascribed with Him in the dominion nor there be for Him need for a protector from humility. And magnify Him a magnification
The Praise belongs to God Who caused the Book to descend to His servant and makes not for it any crookedness
truth-loving, to warn of severe violence from that which proceeds from His Presence and to give good tidings to the ones who believe, those who do as the ones in accord with morality, that they will have a fairer compensation
ones who will abide in it eternally
and to warn those who said: God took to Himself a son
They have no knowledge about it, nor had their fathers. Troublesome is a word that goes forth from their mouths. And they say nothing but a lie
so that perhaps thou wilt be one who consumes thyself with grief for their sake if they believe not in this discourse out of bitterness
Truly, We assigned whatever is in and on the earth as adornment for it so that We try them with it as to which of them are fairer in actions
And, truly, We are ones who make whatever is on it, barren dust, dry earth
Hast thou assumed that the Companions of the Cave and the Bearers of Inscription had been a wonder among Our signs
And when the spiritual warriors took shelter in the Cave, then, they said: Our Lord! Give us mercy from Thy Presence and furnish us with right mindedness in our affair
So We sealed their ears in the Cave for a number of years
Again, We raised them up so that We might know which of the two confederates was better in calculating the space of time they lingered in expectation
We relate this tiding to thee with The Truth. Truly, they were male spiritual warriors who believed in their Lord and We increased them in guidance
And We invigorated their hearts when they stood up and said: Our Lord is Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will never call to any god other than He. Certainly, we would have said an outrageous thing
These, our folk, took to themselves gods other than Him. Why bring they not a clear portent of authority with them? And who does greater wrong than he who devised a lie against God
And when you withdrew from them and from what they worship but God, then, take shelter in the cave. Your Lord will unfold for you from His mercy and will furnish you with a gentle issue in your affair
Thou wouldst have seen the sun when it came up. It inclines from their cave towards the right and when it began to set, it passed them towards the left while they were in a fissure. That is of the signs of God. He whom God guides, he is one who is truly guided. And he whom He causes to go astray, thou wilt never find for him a protector or one who will show him the way
Thou wouldst assume them to be awake while they are ones who are sleeping. We turn them around and around towards the right and towards the left and their dog, one who stretches out its paws at the threshold. And if thou wert to peruse them, thou wouldst have turned from them, running away, and wouldst, certainly, be filled with alarm of them
And, thus, it was that We raised them up that they might demand of one another. Said one who speaks among them: How long lingered you in expectation? They said: We lingered in expectation a day or a part of a day. They said: Your Lord is greater in knowledge of how long you lingered in expectation. So raise up one of you and with this, your money, send him to the city and let him look on which is the purest food. Then, let him bring you provision from there. And let him be courteous and cause not anyone to realize
Truly, if you become manifest to them, they will stone you, or they will cause you to return to their creed and you would not ever prosper
And, thus, We made their case known that they know that the promise of God is true and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt about it. Mention when they contend with one another about their affair. They said: Build over them a structure. Their Lord is greater in knowledge about them. Those who prevailed over their affair said: We, certainly, will take to ourselves over them a place of prostration
They will say: They were three, the fourth of them being their dog. And they will say: They were five, the sixth of them being their dog, guessing at the unseen. And they will say: They were seven, the eighth of them being their dog. Say: My Lord is greater in knowledge of their amount. No one knows them but a few, so altercate not about them but with a manifest argumentation and ask not for advice about them of anyone of them
And, surely, he will not say about something: Truly, I will be one who does that tomorrow
but that you add: If God wills. And remember thy Lord when thou hadst forgotten. And say: Perhaps my Lord will guide me nearer to right mindedness than this
And they lingered in expectation in their cave three hundred years, and they added nine
Say: God is greater in knowledge of how long they lingered in expectation. And to Him belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth. How well He perceives and how well He hears! Other than him, they have no protector and He ascribes no one partners in His determination
And recount what was revealed to thee from the Book of Thy Lord. There is no one who changes His Words. And thou wilt never find other than Him, that which is a haven
And have thou patience thyself with those who call to their Lord in the morning and the evening, wanting His Countenance. And let not thy eyes pass over them wanting the adornment of this present life. And obey not him whose heart We made neglectful of Our Remembrance and who followed his own desires and whose affair had been excess
And say: The Truth is from your Lord. Then, let whoever willed, believe, and let whoever willed, disbelieve. Truly, We made ready a fire for the ones who are unjust. They will be enclosed by its large tent. And if they cry for help, they will be helped with rain, water like molten copper that will scald their faces. Miserable was the drink and how evil a place of rest
Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, truly, We will not waste the compensation of him who did good actions
Those, for them are Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers run. They will be adorned in them with bracelets of gold and they will wear green garments of fine silk and brocade. They will be ones who are reclining in it on raised benches. Excellent is the reward for good deeds and how excellent a place of rest
And propound to them the parable of two men: We assigned to one of them two gardens of grapevines and We encircled them with date palm trees and We made crops between them
Both the gardens gave their produce and fail nothing at all. We caused a river to gush forth in the midst of them
And there had been fruit for him. Then, he said to his companion while he converses with him: I have more wealth than thee and am mightier than a group of men or jinn
And he entered his garden while he is one who is unjust to himself. He said: I think that this will not be destroyed ever
And I think that the Hour will not be one that arises. And if I would be returned to my Lord, I would, surely, find better than this as an overturning
And his companion said to him while he converses with him: Wert thou ungrateful to Him Who created thee out of earth dust, again, out of seminal fluid and, again, shaped thee into a man
Certainly, He is God, my Lord, and I will not ascribe partners with my Lord anyone
Would that when thou hadst entered thy garden thou hadst said: What God willed! There is no strength but with God! If thou hast seen I am less than you in wealth and children
Then, perhaps my Lord will give me better than thy garden and will send on it a thunderclap from heaven. And it will come to be in the morning a place of slippery earth
Or it will come to be in the morning that its water will be sinking into the ground so that thou wilt never be able to seek it out
And its fruit was enclosed. It came to be in the morning he turns around and around the palms of his hands in wretchedness for what he spent on it while it was one that has fallen down in ruins. And he says: Would that I not ascribe partners with my Lord anyone
And there is no faction to help him other than God. And he had been one who is helpless
All protection there belongs to God, The Truth. He is Best in rewarding for good deeds and Best in consequence
And propound for them the parable of this present life: It is like water that We caused to descend from heaven. Then, plants of the earth mingled with it and it becomes straw in the morning that winnows in the winds. And God had been over everything One Who is Omnipotent
Wealth and children are the adornment of this present life. But that which endures are ones in accord with morality. These are better with thy Lord in reward for good deeds and better for hopefulness
And on a Day We will set in motion the mountains and thou wilt see the earth as that which will depart. And We will assemble them and not leave out anyone of them
And they were presented before thy Lord ranged in rows. Certainly, you drew near Us as We created you the first time. Nay! You claimed that We never assign for you something that is promised
And the Book was set in place and thou wilt see the ones who sin being ones who are apprehensive as to what is in it. And they will say: Woe to us! What is this Book? It neither leaves out anything small or great, but counted everything. They will find present what their hands had done. And thy Lord does not wrong anyone
And mention when We said to the angels: Prostrate yourselves to Adam! So they prostrated themselves but Iblis. He had been among the jinn and he disobeyed the command of His Lord. Will you, then, take him to yourselves and his offspring to be protectors other than Me while they are an enemy to you? Miserable was it to give in place ones who are unjust
I called them not to witness the creation of the heavens and the earth nor to their own creation of themselves nor took I to myself the ones who are led astray as assistants
And on a Day when He will say: Cry out to My associates, those who you claimed. Then, they will call out to them, but they will not respond to them and We will make a gulf of doom between them
And the unjust will see the ones who sin in the fire. They thought that they are ones who are about to fall in it and they will not find a place to turn from it
And, certainly, We diversified in this, the Quran, every kind of example for humanity. And the human being had been more than anything argumentative
Nothing prevented humanity from believing when the guidance drew near to them or from asking forgiveness of their Lord, but that approaches them a custom of the ancient ones or approaches them the punishment face to face
We send not the ones who are sent, but as ones who give good tidings and as ones who warn. And those who were ungrateful dispute with falsehood in order to refute The Truth by it. And they took My signs to themselves—and what they were warned of—in mockery
And who does greater wrong than he who was reminded of the signs of his Lord, then, turned aside from them and forgot what his hands put forward? Truly, We laid sheathes on their hearts so that they should not understand it and heaviness in their ears. And if thou hast called them to the guidance, yet they will not be truly guided ever
And thy Lord is Forgiving, Possessor of Mercy. If He were to take them to task for what they earned, He will quicken the punishment for them. But for them is what they are promised, from which they will never find a way to elude it
And these towns, We caused them to perish when they did wrong and We assigned for their destruction what is promised
Mention when Moses said to his spiritual warrior: I will not quit until I reach the place of meeting of the two seas even if I will go on for many years
But when they reached the place of the meeting between them, then, they both forgot their great fish and it took to itself a way through the sea, burrowing
Then, when they crossed, he said to his spiritual warrior: Give us our breakfast. Certainly, we met fatigue from our journey
He said: Hadst thou considered? When we took shelter at the rock, truly, I forgot the great fish. And none but Satan caused me to forget to remember it. And it took to itself to a way into the sea in a wondrous way
He said: That is what we had been looking for! So they went back following their footsteps
Then, they found a servant among Our servants to whom We gave mercy from Us and We taught him knowledge which proceeds from Our Presence
Moses said to him: May I follow thee so that thou wilt teach me something of what thou wert taught of right judgment
He said: Truly, thou wilt never be able to have patience with me
And how wilt thou endure a thing patiently when thou hast not comprehended any awareness of it
Moses said: Thou wilt find me, if God willed, one who remains steadfast and I will not rebel against thy command
He said: Then, if thou hadst followed me, ask me not about anything until I cause to be evoked in thee a remembrance of it
So they both set out until when they embarked in a vessel. He made a hole in it. Moses said: Hadst thou made a hole in it in order to drown the people? Certainly, thou hadst brought about a dreadful thing
He said: Said I not that thou wilt never be able to have patience with me
Moses said: Take me not to task for what I forgot and constrain me not with hardship for my affair
Then, they both set out until when they met a boy; then, he killed him. Moses said: Hadst thou killed a pure soul without his having slain a soul? Certainly, thou hadst brought about a horrible thing
He said: Said I not that thou wilt never be able to have patience with me
Moses said: If I asked thee about anything after this, then, keep not company with me, surely, thou hadst reached enough of excusing from my presence
Then, they both set out until when they approached a people of a town. They asked its people for food. But they refused to receive them as guests. Then, they found in it a wall that wants to tumble down, so he repaired it. Moses said: If thou hadst willed, certainly, thou wouldst have taken compensation to thyself for it
He said: This is the parting between me and between thee! I will tell thee the interpretation of what thou wert not able to have patience for it
As for the vessel, it had been of some needy people who toil in the sea, so I wanted to mar it as there had been a king behind them taking every vessel forcefully
And as for the boy, both his parents had been ones who believe, and we dreaded that he should constrain them with defiance and ingratitude
so we wanted their Lord to cause for them in exchange one better than he in purity and nearer in sympathy
As for the wall, it had been that of two orphan boys in the city and beneath it had been a treasure for them. The father of both of them had been one in accord with morality so thy Lord wanted they be fully grown, having come of age, and pull out their treasure as a mercy from thy Lord. And I accomplished that not of my own command. This is the interpretation of what thou wert not able to have patience for it
And they will ask thee about Dhu-l Qarnayn. Say: I will recount to you a remembrance of him
Truly, We established him firmly on the earth and gave him a route to everything
So he pursued a route
until when he reached the setting of the sun. He found it beginning to set in a spring of muddy water. And he found near it a folk. We said: O Dhu-l Qarnayn! Either thou wilt punish them or thou wilt take them to thyself with goodness
He said: As for him who did wrong, we will punish him. Again, he will be returned to his Lord Who will punish him with a horrible punishment
But as for him who believed and did as one in accord with morality, he will have the fairer recompense. And we will say to him of our command with ease
Again, he pursued a route
until when he reached the rising place of the sun. He found it coming up on a folk for whom We make not any obstruction against it
Thus, We, surely, enclosed whatever was near him through awareness
Again, he pursued a route
until when he reached between two embankments. He found behind them a folk who would almost not understand any saying
They said: O Dhu-l Qarnayn! Truly, Gog and Magog are ones who make corruption in and on the earth. Will we assign to thee payment if thou hast made an embankment between us and between them
He said: What my Lord established firmly for me is better, so assist me with strength. I will make a fortification between you and between them
Give me ingots of iron, until when he made level between the two cliffs. He said: Blow, until when he made it a fire. He said: Give me molten brass to pour out over it
So they were not able to scale it nor were they able to dig through it
He said: This is a mercy from my Lord. So when the promise of my Lord drew near, He will made it powder. And the promise of my Lord had been true
And that Day We will leave some of them to surge like waves on some others. And the trumpet will be blown, then, We will gather them altogether
We will present the depths of hell on that Day in plain view to ones who are ungrateful
to those whose eyes had been screened from My Remembrance and who had not been able to hear
Assumed ones who were ungrateful that they take My servants to themselves as protectors instead of Me? Truly, We made hell ready with hospitality for ones who are ungrateful
Say: Shall We tell you who will be ones who are losers by their actions
It is those whose endeavoring went astray in this present life while they assume that they are doing good by their handiwork
Those were those who were ungrateful for the signs of their Lord and the meeting with Him so their actions were fruitless. And so We will not perform for them on the Day of Resurrection, any weighing
That will be their recompense—hell—because they were ungrateful and took to themselves My signs and My Messengers in mockery
Truly, those who believed and did as ones in accord with morality, their hospitality had been in the Gardens of Paradise
ones who will dwell in them forever. They will have no desire for relocation from there
Say: If the sea had been ink for the Words of my Lord, the sea would come to an end before the Words of my Lord came to an end even if We brought about replenishment the like of it
Say: I am only a mortal like you. It is revealed to me that your God is One, so whoever had been hoping for the meeting with his Lord, let him do with his actions as one in accord with morality and ascribe no partners—in the worship of his Lord, ever
K[f H[ Y[ <A @[d]
A remembrance of the mercy of thy Lord to His servant Zechariah
when he cried out to his Lord, secretively crying out
He said: My Lord! Truly, I—my bones became feeble and my head became studded with grayness of hair and I be not disappointed in my supplication to Thee, O my Lord
And, truly, I feared for my defenders after me. And my woman had been a barren woman. So bestow on me from that which proceeds from Thy Presence a protector
He will inherit from me and inherit from the family of Jacob. And make him, my Lord, pleasing
O Zechariah! Truly, We give thee the good tidings of a boy. His name will be Yahya and We assigned it not as a namesake for anyone before
He said: My Lord! How will I have a boy while my woman had been a barren woman and, surely, I reached an advanced old age
He said: It is about to be! Thy Lord said: It is insignificant for Me and, surely, I created thee before when thou wast nothing
Zechariah said: My Lord! Assign for me a sign. He said: Thy sign is that thou wilt not speak to humanity for three nights, although being without fault
So he went forth to his folk from the sanctuary. Then, he revealed to them: Glorify in the early morning dawn and evening
O Yahya! Take the Book with strength. And We gave him critical judgment while a lad
and Our continuous mercy from that which proceeds from Our Presence and purity and he had been devout
and pious to ones who are his parents and be not haughty nor rebellious
And peace be on him the day on which he was given birth and the day he dies and the day he is raised up, living
And remember Mary in the Book when she went apart from her people to an eastern place
Then, she took to herself a partition away from them, so We sent Our Spirit to her and he presented himself before her as a mortal without fault
She said: Truly, I take refuge in The Merciful from thee; come not near me if thou hadst been devout
He said: I am only a messenger from thy Lord that I bestow on thee (f) a pure boy
She said: How will I have a boy when no mortal touches me, nor am I an unchaste woman
He said: Thus, it will be. Thy Lord said: It is for Me insignificant. And: We will assign him as a sign for humanity and as a mercy from Us. And it had been that which is a decreed command
So she conceived him and she went apart with him to a farther place
And the birth pangs surprised her at the trunk of a date palm tree. She said: O would that I had died before this and I had been one who is forgotten, a forgotten thing
So he cried out to her from beneath her: Feel not remorse! Surely, thy Lord made under thee (f) a brook
And shake towards thee (f) the trunk of the date palm tree. It will cause ripe, fresh dates to fall on thee
So eat and drink and thy eyes be refreshed. If thou hast seen any mortal, say: I vowed formal fasting to The Merciful so I will never speak to any human being this day
Then, she approached her folk with him, carrying him. They said: O Mary! Surely, thou hadst drawn near a monstrous thing
O sister of Aaron! Thy father had not been a reprehensible man nor was thy mother an unchaste woman
Then, she pointed to him. They said: How speak we to one who had been in the cradle, a lad
Jesus said: Truly, I am a servant of God. He gave me the Book and He made me a Prophet
And He made me one who is blessed wherever I had been and He bequeathed to me the formal prayer and the purifying alms as long as I continue living
and He makes me pious toward one who is my mother and He makes me not haughty nor disappointed
And peace be on me the day I was given birth and the day I die and the day I am raised up, living
That is Jesus son of Mary, a saying of The Truth. They contest what is in it
It had not been for God that He takes to Himself a son. Glory be to Him! When He decreed a command, He not but says to it: Be! Then, it is
And, truly, God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path
There was variance among the confederates, so woe to those who were ungrateful from the scene of a tremendous Day
Hear well and perceive well. On that Day they will approach Us, but today the ones who are unjust are in a clear wandering astray
And warn thou them of the Day of Regret when the command would be decided. Yet they are heedless and they believe not
Truly, We will inherit the earth and whatever is in and on it and to Us they will be returned
And remember Abraham in the Book. Truly, he had been a just person, a Prophet
That is when he said to his father: O my father! Why wilt thou worship what hears not, and perceives not, and avails thee not anything
O my father! Truly, I, there drew near me of the knowledge of what approaches thee not. So follow me and I will guide thee to a path without fault
O my father! Worship not Satan. Truly, Satan had been rebellious towards The Merciful
O my father! Truly, I fear that a punishment should afflict thee from The Merciful so that thou become a protector of Satan
He said: Art thou one who shrinks from my gods, O Abraham? If thou wilt not refrain thyself, certainly, I will stone thee, so abandon me for some while
He said: Peace be to thee. I will ask for forgiveness from my Lord for thee. Truly, He had been One Who is Gracious to me
And I will withdraw from you and what you call to other than God and I will call to my Lord. Perhaps I will not be disappointed in my supplication to my Lord
So he withdrew from them and what they worship other than God. And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob. And each of them We made a Prophet
And We bestowed on them from Our mercy and We assigned them the tongue of lofty sincerity
And remember Moses in the Book. Truly, he had been one who was devoted and he had been a Messenger, a Prophet
And We proclaimed to him from the right edge of the mount and We brought him near privately
And We bestowed on him out of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a Prophet
And remember Ishmael in the Book. Truly, he had been one who is sincere in his promise, and he had been a Messenger, a Prophet
He had been commanding his people to formal prayer and the purifying alms and he had been with His Lord one who is well-pleasing
And remember Enoch in the Book. Truly, he had been a just person, a Prophet
And We exalted him to a lofty place
Those are those to whom God was gracious from among the Prophets of the offspring of Adam and whomever We carried with Noah and of the offspring of Abraham and Israel, Jacob, from among whomever We guided and elected. When are recounted to them the signs of the Merciful they fell down, crying, ones who prostrate themselves.‡
Then, after them succeeded a succession who wasted the formal prayer and followed their lusts. So they will meet error
but the ones who repented and believed and did as ones in accord with morality. For those will enter the Garden and they will not be wronged at all
Gardens of Eden which The Merciful promised His servants in the unseen. Truly, He, His promise had been that which is kept
They will not hear in them idle talk, nothing but: Peace. And they will have their provision in them in the early morning dawn and evening
This is the Garden which We will give as inheritance to whomever of Our servants who had been devout
And we come forth not but by the command of thy Lord. To Him belongs whatever is in advance of us and whatever is behind us and whatever is in between that. And thy Lord had not been forgetful
the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them! So worship Him and maintain thou patience in His worship. Hast thou known any namesake for Him
And the human being says: When I am dead, will I be brought out living
Will the human being not remember that We created him before when he be of nothing
So by thy Lord, certainly, We will assemble them and the satans. Again, We will parade them around hell, ones who crawl on their knees
Again, We will tear out every partisan, whoever of them was more severe in stubborn rebellion against The Merciful
After that We are greater in knowledge of those, they who are most deserving of roasting in it
There is none of you, but ones who go down to it. This had been a thing decreed, that decreed by thy Lord
Again, We will deliver those who were Godfearing and We will forsake the ones who are unjust, in it, ones who crawl on their knees
And when are recounted to them Our signs, clear portents, those who were ungrateful would say to those who believed: Which of the two groups of people is best in station and fairer in alliance
How many before them We caused to perish whose generation was fairer in furnishing and outward show
Say: Whoever had been in fallacy, The Merciful will prolong his prolonging for him. Until when they would see what they are promised, either the punishment or the Hour, then, they will know whose place is worse and whose army is weak
And God increases in guidance those who were truly guided and endure in accord with morality. They are better with thy Lord in reward for good deeds and better for turning back
Hadst thou seen him who was ungrateful for Our signs, who said: Will I be given wealth and children
Perused he the unseen or took he to himself a compact from The Merciful
No indeed! We will write down what he says. We will cause the punishment to increase for him, prolonging it
And We will inherit from him all that he says and he will approach Us individually
And they took to themselves gods other than God that there be a triumph for them
No indeed! They will disbelieve in what they worship and they will be taking a stand against them
Hast thou not considered that We sent the satans against the ones who were ungrateful to confound them with confusion
So hasten thou not against them. We only number for them a sum
On the Day We will assemble the ones who are Godfearing to The Merciful like an entourage
And We will drive the ones who sin to hell, herding them
None of them will possess the power of intercession but such a one who took to himself a compact with The Merciful
And they said: The Merciful took to Himself a son
Certainly, you brought about a disastrous thing
whereby the heavens are almost split asunder and the earth is split and the mountains fall crashing down
that they attributed a son to The Merciful
It is not fit and proper for The Merciful that He should take a son to Himself
There is none at all in the heavens and the earth but he be one who arrives to The Merciful as a servant
Certainly, He counted for them and numbered up a sum
And every one of them will be ones who arrive to Him individually on the Day of Resurrection
Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, The Merciful will assign ardor for them
So, truly, We made this easy on thy tongue. Certainly, thou wilt give good tidings with it to the ones who are Godfearing and thou wilt warn a most stubborn folk with it
How many a generation caused We to perish before them? Art thou conscious of anyone of them or hear you so much as a whisper from them
H
We caused not the Quran to descend to thee that thee be in despair
but as an admonition to him who dreads
a sending down successively from Him Who created the earth and the lofty heavens
The Merciful turned His attention to the Throne
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and whatever is between them and whatever is beneath the soil
And if thou art to publish a saying, yet, truly, He knows the secret and what is more secret
God, there is no god but He. To Him belongs the Fairer Names
Has the conversation of Moses approached thee
When he saw a fire, he said to his people: Abide! Truly, I observed a fire so that perhaps I will bring you some firebrand from it or I find guidance at the fire
When he approached it, it was proclaimed: O Moses
Truly, I—I am thy Lord! So take off thy shoes; truly, thou art one who is in the sanctified valley of Tuwa
And I chose thee so listen to what is revealed
Truly, I—I am God. There is no god but Me. So worship Me and perform the formal prayer of My Remembrance
Truly, the Hour is that which arrives. I am about to conceal it so that every soul is given recompense for what it endeavors
So let none bar thee from it—whoever believes not in it and followed his own desires—so that thee not survive
And what is that in thy right hand O Moses
Moses said: This is my staff. I lean on it, and beat down leaves from a tree with it for my herd of sheep and for me in it are other uses
He said: Cast it, O Moses
So he cast it. That is when it was a viper sliding
He said: Take it and fear not. We will cause it to return to its first state
And clasp thy hand to thy armpit. It will go forth shimmering white without any evil as another sign
that We cause thee to see of Our greater signs
Go thou to Pharaoh! Truly, he was defiant
Moses said: My Lord
Expand my breast for me and make Thou my affair easy for me
and untie the knot from my tongue
so they understand my saying
and assign to me a minister from my people—
—Aaron, my brother
Strengthen my vigor with him
and ascribe him as a partner in my affair
that we glorify Thee much
and we remember Thee frequently
Truly, Thou, Thou alone hadst been seeing of us
He said: Surely, thou wert given thy petition, O Moses
Certainly, We showed grace on thee another time
when We revealed to thy mother what is revealed
Cast him adrift in the ark. Then, cast it adrift into the water of the sea. Then, the water of the sea will cast him up on the bank and he will be taken by an enemy of Mine and an enemy of his. And I cast on thee fondness from Me that thou be trained under My Eye
Mention when thy sister walks saying: Shall I point you to one who will take control of him? So We returned thee to thy mother that her eyes settle down and she not feel remorse. And thou hast killed a soul, but We delivered thee from lament and We tried thee with an ordeal. Then, thou hadst lingered in expectation years among the people of Midian. Again, thou hadst drawn near according to a measure, O Moses
And I chose thee for service for Myself
Go thou and thy brother with My signs and you both not be inattentive in My Remembrance
So go both of you to Pharaoh. Truly, he had become defiant
And both say to him a saying gently, so that perhaps he will recollect or dread
They both said: Our Lord! Truly, we fear that he should exceed against us or that he be defiant
He said: Fear not. Truly, I am with both of you. I hear and I see
So approach you both to him and say: Truly, we are Messengers of thy Lord. So send the Children of Israel with us and punish them not. Surely, we drew near thee with a sign from thy Lord. And peace be to him who followed the guidance
Surely, it was revealed to us that the punishment is on him who denied and turned away
He said: Then, who is the Lord of you two, O Moses
He said: Our Lord is He Who gave everything its creation; again, He guided it
Pharaoh said: Then, what of the first generations
Moses said: The knowledge of them is with my Lord in a Book. My Lord neither goes astray nor forgets
He it is Who assigned for you the earth as a cradle and threaded ways for you in it and caused water to descend from heaven. And We brought out from it diverse pairs of plants
Eat and give attention to your flocks. Truly, in this are signs for the people imbued with sense
We created you from it and into it We will cause you to return and from it We will bring you out another time
And, certainly, We caused Pharaoh to see Our signs—all of them—but he denied and refused
He said: Hast thou drawn near us to drive us out of our region with thy sorcery, O Moses
Then, truly, we will bring for thee sorcery like it. So make something that is promised between us and thee—neither we nor thou will break it—at a mutually agreeable place
Moses said: That promised will be for the Day of Adornment and let humanity be assembled in the forenoon
So Pharaoh turned away. Then, he gathered his cunning. After that he approached
Moses said to them: Woe to you! Devise you not a lie against God so that He put an end to you with a punishment. And, surely, he who devised will be frustrated
So they contended between each other about their affair and they kept secret, conspiring secretly
They said: Truly, these two are the ones who are sorcerers who want to drive you out from your region with their sorcery and take away your most ideal behavior
So summon up your cunning. Again, approach ranged in rows. And, truly, he who prospered this day is whoever gained the upper hand
They said: O Moses! Either thou wilt cast or let us be the first to cast
He said: Nay! You cast. That is when their ropes and their staffs seem to him to be, by their sorcery, as though they are sliding
So Moses sensed awe in himself
We said: Fear not! Truly, thou, thou art lofty
And cast what is in thy right hand. It will swallow what they crafted. What they crafted is not but the cunning of one who is a sorcerer. And the one who is a sorcerer will not prosper in whatever he approached
Then, the ones who are sorcerers were cast down, ones who prostrate themselves. They said: We believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses
Pharaoh said: Believed you in Him before I give you permission? Truly, he is your teacher who taught you the sorcery. So, certainly, I will cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides and, certainly, I will cause you to be crucified on the trunks of date palm trees, and, certainly, you will know which of us is more severe in punishment and one who endures
They said: We will never hold thee in greater favor over the clear portents that drew near us nor over Who originated us. So decide whatever thou wilt as one who decides. Thou wilt decide not but about this present life
For us, truly, we believed in our Lord that He forgive us our transgressions and what thou hadst compelled us to do because of the sorcery. And God is Best of one who endures
Truly, whoever approaches his Lord as one who sins, then, truly, for him is hell. Neither will he die in it nor will he live
And whoever approaches Him as one who believes, who, surely, did as the one in accord with morality, then, for those, they are of lofty degrees
Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever. And that is the recompense of whoever purified himself
And, certainly, We revealed to Moses that set thou forth with My servants. Then, strike for them a dry road in the sea, neither fearing to be overtaken, nor dreading that
Then, Pharaoh and his army pursued them. Then, overcame them the water of the sea by what overcame
And Pharaoh caused his folk to go astray and he guided them not
O Children of Israel! Surely, We rescued you from your enemy and We appointed someone with you on the right edge of the mount and We sent down to you the manna and the quails
Eat from what is good that We provided you, and be not defiant in it so that My anger not alight on you. And he on whom My anger alights surely, will be hurled to ruin
And, truly, I am a Forgiver of whoever repented and believed and did as one in accord with morality. Again, he was truly guided
And what caused thee to hasten from thy folk, O Moses
Moses said: They are those who are close on my footsteps and I hastened to Thee, my Lord that I please thee
He said: Then, truly, We tried thy folk after thee and the Samaritan caused them to go astray
Then, Moses returned to his folk enraged, grieved. He said: O my folk! Promise you not with your Lord a fairer promise? Was the compact too long for you to wait? Or wanted you that the anger of your Lord alight on you, so you broke what you were to have promised me
They said: We broke not what was promised to thee from what is within our power, but we were charged with a heavy load of the adornments of the folk. Surely, we hurled them because the Samaritan cast
Then, he brought out for them a calf, a lifeless body that had the lowing sound of flocks. Then, they said: This is your god and the God of Moses whom he forgot
Then, see they not that it returns not to them a saying and it possesses for them neither hurt nor profit
And, certainly, Aaron said to them before: O my folk! You were only tempted by it. And, truly, your Lord is The Merciful. So follow me and obey my command
They said: We will never quit it as ones who give ourselves up until Moses returns to us
He said: O Aaron! What prevented thee when thou hadst seen them going astray
that thou hast followed me not? Hast thou, then, rebelled against my command
Aaron said: O son of my mother! Take me not by my beard nor by my head. Truly, I dreaded that thou hast said: Thou hadst separated and divided between the Children of Israel and thou hast not regarded my saying
Moses said: Then, what is thy business O Samaritan
He said: I kept watch over what they keep not watch, so I seized a handful of dust from the foot prints of the Messenger and cast it forth. And thus my soul enticed me
Moses said: Then go off! Truly for thee in this life is that thou mayest say: Untouchable; there is for thee something promised that thou shalt never break; and look on thy god that thou hast stayed with and given thyself up to; certainly we will burn it. After that we will certainly scatter it in the water of the sea in a scattering
Your God is only God Whom there is no god but He. He encompassed everything in His knowledge
Thus We relate to thee some tiding of what preceded. And surely We gave thee from that which proceeds from Our Presence a Remembrance
Whoever turned aside from it, then truly he will carry a heavy load on the Day of Resurrection
ones who will dwell in it forever; how evil for them on the Day of Resurrection will be the load
on the Day the trumpet will be blown. We will assemble the ones who sin, white eyed on that Day
They will whisper among themselves: You lingered in expectation but ten days
We are greater in knowledge of what they will say when the most ideal of them in tradition says: You lingered in expectation not but a day
And they will ask thee about the mountains. Then, say: My Lord will scatter them a scattering
Then, He will forsake it as a leveled spacious plain
Then, thou wilt see not in it any crookedness nor unevenness
On that Day they will follow one who calls. There will be no crookedness in him. And voices will be hushed for The Merciful so thou wilt hear nothing but a murmuring
On a Day intercession will not profit anyone but him to whom gave permission The Merciful and with whose saying He was well-pleased
He knows what is in advance of them and what is behind them and they will not comprehend Him in knowledge
And faces will be humbled before The Living, The Eternal while, surely, will be frustrated whoever was burdened by doing injustice
Whoever does as the one in accord with morality and he is one who believes, then, he will neither fear injustice nor unfairness
And, thus, We caused it to descend as an Arabic Recitation. And We diversified the threats in it so that perhaps they will be Godfearing or cause the Remembrance to be evoked by them
Then, exalted be God, The True King, and hasten not the Recitation before its revelation is decreed to thee. And say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge
And, certainly, We made a compact with Adam before. Then, he forgot and We find no constancy in him
And when We said to the angels: Prostrate yourselves to Adam! They prostrated themselves, but Iblis who refused
Then, We said: O Adam! Truly, this is an enemy to thee and to thy spouse, so let him not drive you both out from the Garden so that thou wouldst be in despair
Truly, it is not for thee that thou hunger in it nor to be naked
And, truly, thou wilt not thirst in it nor suffer the heat of the sun
Then, Satan whispered evil to him. He said: O Adam! Will I point thee to the Tree of Infinity and a dominion that will not decay
Then, they both ate from that so the intimate parts of both showed to both themselves. Both of them took to doing stitching together over both from the leaves of the Garden. And Adam rebelled against his Lord and he erred
Again, his Lord elected him. Then, He turned in forgiveness to him and guided him
He said: Get you both down from here altogether, some of you an enemy to some others. Then, if guidance approaches you from Me, then, whoever followed My Guidance, neither will he go astray, nor will he be in despair
And whoever turned aside from My Remembrance, then, truly, for him is a livelihood of narrowness. And We will assemble him on the Day of Resurrection unseeing
He would say: My Lord! Why hadst Thou assembled me with the unseeing when, surely, I had been seeing
He would say: It is thus: Our signs approached thee, but thou hadst forgotten them and, thus, this Day thou wilt be forgotten
And, thus, We give recompense to him who exceeded all bounds and believes not in signs of his Lord. And, surely, punishment in the world to come is more severe and one that endures
Guide He not them? How many generations We caused to perish before them amidst whose dwellings they walk. Truly, in this are signs for the people imbued with sense
And if a Word preceded not from thy Lord for a term that was determined, it would be close at hand
So have thou patience with what they say and glorify the praises of thy Lord before the coming up of the sun and before sunset and during the nighttime night watch and glorify at the end of the daytime, so that perhaps thou wilt be well-pleased
And stretch not out thy eyes for what We gave of enjoyment in this life to spouses among them as the luster of this present life so that We try them by it. And provision of thy Lord is Best and that which endures
And command thy people to the formal prayer, and to maintain patience in it. We ask not of thee for any provision. We provide for thee and the Ultimate End will be for the God-conscious
And they said: Why brings he not to us a sign from his Lord? Approaches them not clear portents that were in the first scrolls
And if We caused them to perish with a punishment before this, certainly, they would have said: Our Lord! Why hadst Thou not sent to us a Messenger so that we follow Thy signs before we are degraded and humiliated
Say: Each is one who is waiting so watch. Then, you will know who are the Companions of the Path without fault and who were truly guided
The reckoning for humanity was near while they are ones who turn aside in heedlessness
Approaches them not a remembrance from their Lord, that which is renewed, but they listened to it while they play
being ones whose hearts are ones that are diverted, and they kept secret, conspiring secretly those who did wrong? Is this other than a mortal like you? Then, will you approach sorcery while you perceive
He said: My Lord knows The Word of the heavens and the earth. And He is The Hearing, The Knowing
Nay! They said: Jumbled nightmares! Nay! He but devised it! Nay! He is but a poet! Let him bring us a sign as the ancient ones were sent
No town believed before them of whom We caused to perish. Will they, then, believe
And We sent not before thee but men to whom We reveal. So ask the People of the Remembrance if you had not been knowing
And We made them not lifeless bodies that eat not food nor had they been ones who will dwell forever
Again, We were sincere in the promise. So We rescued them and whom We will. We caused the ones who are excessive to perish
Surely, We caused a Book to descend to you in which is your Remembrance. Will you not, then, be reasonable
How many a town We damaged that had been one that is unjust and caused to grow after them another folk
Then, when they were conscious of Our might, that is when they make haste from it
Make not haste, but return to what you were given of ease in it and to your dwellings, so that perhaps you will be asked
They said: O woe to us! Truly, we had been ones who are unjust
Then, truly, they ceased not calling that out until We made them as stubble, ones silent and stilled
And We created not the heavens and the earth and what is between them as ones in play
If We wanted We would have taken some diversion. We would take it to Ourselves from that which proceeds from Our Presence if We had been ones who do so
Nay! We hurl The Truth against falsehood so it prevails over it. That is when falsehood is that which vanishes away. And woe to you for what you allege
And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth. And whoever is near Him, they grow not arrogant to worship Him, nor they be weary
They glorify Him nighttime and daytime. They never decrease
Or took they gods to themselves from the earth, they, ones who revive the dead
If there had been gods in it—other than God— certainly, both would have gone to ruin. Then, glory be to God! Lord of the Throne! High above what they allege
He will not be asked as to what He accomplishes, but they will be asked
Or took they gods to themselves other than He? Say: Prepare your proof. This is a Remembrance for him who is with me and a Remembrance of him before me. Nay! Most of them know not The Truth, so they are ones who turn aside
And We sent not before thee any Messenger, but We reveal to him that there is no god but I, so worship Me
And they said: The Merciful took to Himself a son. Glory be to Him! Nay! Honored servants
They precede Him not in saying and they act by His command
He knows what is in advance of them and what is behind them and they intercede not but for him with whom He was content. And they are dreading Him, ones who are apprehensive
And whoever says of them: Truly, I am a god other than He, then, We will give recompense to him with hell. Thus, We give recompense to the ones who are unjust
Consider not those who were ungrateful that the heavens and the earth had been interwoven and We unstitched them? And We made every living thing of water. Will they, then, not believe
And We made firm mountains on the earth so that it should not vibrate with them. And We made in it ravines as ways, so that perhaps they will be truly guided
And We made heaven as a guarded roof. Yet they are ones who turn aside from its signs
And it is He Who created the nighttime and the daytime, the sun and the moon, each swimming in orbit
And We assigned not to any mortal before thee immortality. If thou wert to die will they be ones who dwell forever
Every soul is one that experiences death. And We will try you with the worst and good as a test. And to Us you will be returned
And when those who were ungrateful saw thee, they take thee to themselves not but in mockery: Ha! Is this he who mentions your gods? And they, for Remembrance of The Merciful, they are ones who are ungrateful
The human being was created of haste. I will cause you to see My signs, so seek not to hasten
And they say: When will this promise be if you had been ones who are sincere
If those who were ungrateful but know at the time when they will not limit the fire from their faces, nor from their backs and they will not be helped
Nay! It will approach them suddenly. Then, it will dumfound them so they will not be able to come back nor will they be given respite
And, certainly, Messengers were ridiculed before thee. Then, those who derided them were surrounded by what they had been ridiculing
Say: Who will guard you in the nighttime and the daytime from The Merciful? Nay! They, from the Remembrance of their Lord, are ones who turn aside
Or secure them their gods from Us? They are not able to help themselves, nor will they be rendered safe from Us
Nay! We gave enjoyment to these, their fathers until their lifetime was long for them. Consider they not that We approach the earth? We reduce it of its outlying parts. Or will they be the ones who are the victors
Say: I warn you only by the revelation. But hear not the unwilling to hear, the calling to them when they are warned
And if a breath afflicted them of punishment of thy Lord, they would, surely, say: O woe to us! Truly, we had been ones who are unjust
And We will lay down the balances of equity on the Day of Resurrection. Then, no soul will be wronged at all. And even if it had been the weight of a grain of a mustard seed We will bring it. And We sufficed as Ones Who Reckon
And, certainly, We gave Moses and Aaron the Criterion between right and wrong and an illumination and a Remembrance for the ones who are Godfearing
those who dread their Lord in the unseen while they are ones who are apprehensive of the Hour
This is a blessed Remembrance We caused to descend. Are you, then, ones who know not of it
Certainly, We gave Abraham his right judgment before. And We had been ones who know of him
when he said to his father and his folk: What are these images to which you be ones who give yourselves up to
They said: We found our fathers as ones who are worshippers of them
He said: Certainly, you and your fathers had been in a clear wandering astray
They said: Hadst thou drawn near The Truth or art thou of the ones who play
He said: Nay! Your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who originated them. And I am of the ones who bear witness to this
And by God, I will contrive against your idols after you turn as ones who draw back
So he made them broken pieces—but the greatest of them—so that perhaps they will return to it
They said: Who accomplished this with our gods? Truly, he is of the ones who are unjust
They said: We heard a spiritual warrior (m) mention them. It is said he is Abraham
They said: Then, approach with him before the eyes of personages so that perhaps they will bear witness
They said: Hast thou accomplished this with our gods O Abraham
He said: Nay! It was accomplished by the greatest of them—this. So ask them if they had been able to speak for themselves
Then, they returned to one another. Then, they said: Truly, you, you are the ones who are unjust
Again, they were put into confusion: Certainly, thou hadst known that these speak not for themselves
He said: Worship you, then, other than God what neither profits you nor hurts you at all
Fie on you on what you worship other than God. Will you not, then, be reasonable
They said: Burn him and help your gods if you had been ones who do so
We said: O fire! Be coolness and peace for Abraham
And they wanted to use cunning against him, but We made them the ones who are losers
And We delivered him and Lot to the region which We blessed for the worlds
And We bestowed Isaac on him and Jacob as an unexpected gift. And We made both of them ones in accord with morality
And We made them leaders, guiding by Our command. And We revealed to them the accomplishing of good deeds and the performing of the formal prayer and the giving of the purifying alms. And they had been ones who worship Us
And to Lot We gave him critical judgment and knowledge and We delivered him from the town which had been doing deeds of corruption. Truly, they had been a reprehensible folk, ones who disobey
And We caused him to enter into Our Mercy. Truly, he was among the ones in accord with morality
And mention Noah, when he cried out before and We responded to him. And We delivered him and his people from the tremendous distress
And We helped him against the folk who denied Our signs. Truly, they had been a reprehensible folk. So We drowned them one and all
And mention David and Solomon, when they give judgment about cultivation when a herd of the sheep of his folk strayed. And to their critical judgment We had been ones who bear witness
So We caused Solomon to understand it. And We gave each of them critical judgment and knowledge. And We caused to become subservient to David, the mountains and the birds to glorify God. And We had been ones who do such things
We taught him the art of making garments of chain mail for you to fortify you from your violence. Will you, then, be ones who are thankful
And to Solomon, the wind tempest runs by His command toward the earth which We blessed. We had been ones who know everything
Among the satans are some who dive for him and do actions other than that. And We had been ones who guard over them
And Job, when he cried out to his Lord: Truly, harm afflicted me and Thou art One Who is Most Merciful of the ones who are merciful
So We responded to him. Then, We removed his harm. And We gave him back his people and the like of others with them as a mercy from Us and as a reminder of ones who worship
And Ishmael and Enoch and Dhul-Kifl, all were of the ones who remain steadfast
And We caused them to enter into Our mercy. They are the ones in accord with morality
And Jonah, when he went as one who is enraged, and thought that We would never have power over him. And, then, he cried out through the shadows that: There is no god, but Thou! Glory be to Thee! Truly, I had been of the ones who are unjust
So We responded to him. And We delivered him from the lament. And, thus, We rescue the ones who believe
And mention Zechariah when he cried out to his Lord: My Lord! Forsake me not unassisted and Thou art Best of the ones who inherit
So We responded to him and We bestowed Yahya on him. And We made things right for his spouse and for him. Truly, they had been competing with one another in good deeds and they would call to Us with yearning and reverence. And they had been ones who are humbled before Us
And she who guarded her private parts, then, We breathed into her Our Spirit and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds
Truly, this, your community, is one community and I am your Lord so worship Me
But they cut asunder their affair between them. Yet all of them are ones who return to Us
So whoever does as the ones in accord with morality and he is one who believes, then, his endeavoring will not be rejected. And, truly, We will be One Who Inscribes it for him
And there is a ban on the town that We caused to perish. They will not return
until Gog and Magog are let loose and they slide down from every slope
And the true promise will be near. That is when the sight will be that which fixed in horror of those who were ungrateful! O woe to us. Surely, we had been in heedlessness of this. Nay! We had been ones who were unjust
Truly, you and what you worship other than God are fuel material for hell. You are the ones who go down to it
If these had been gods, they would never have gone down to it. All are ones who will dwell in it forever
There will be sobbing in it for them and they, their gods, will not hear in it
Truly, those to whom there has preceded the fairer from Us, those are ones who are far removed from it
They will not hear even the low sound of it. And they, in that for which their souls lusted, will be ones who will dwell in it forever
The greater terror will not dishearten them and the angels will admit them: This is your day that you had been promised
On a Day when We roll up the heavens like the rolling up of the written scroll of manuscripts, as We began the first creation, We will cause it to return. It is a promise from Us. Truly, We had been ones who do
And, certainly, We wrote down in the Psalms after the Remembrance that the earth will be inherited by My servants—the ones who are in accord with morality
Truly, in this is the delivering of this message for the folk, ones who worship
And We sent thee not but as a mercy for the worlds
Say: It is only revealed to me that your god is One God. Will you, then, be ones who submit to God
But if they turned away, then, say: I proclaimed to you all equally. And I am not informed whether what you are promised is near or far
Truly, He knows the openly published saying and He knows what you keep back
And I am not informed so that perhaps it will be a test for you and an enjoyment for a while
He said: My Lord! Give Thou judgment between us with The Truth. And our Lord is The Merciful, He Whose help is being sought against what you allege
O humanity! Be Godfearing of your Lord. Truly, the earthquake of the Hour is a tremendous thing. On a Day you will see it
every one who is breast feeding will be negligent of whoever she breast fed. And every pregnant woman will bring forth a foetus and thou wilt see humanity intoxicated yet they will not be intoxicated. But the punishment of God will be severe
And among humanity is he who disputes about God without knowledge and follows every rebel satan
It was written down about him that whoever turned away to him as a friend, truly, he will cause him to go astray and will guide him to the punishment of the blaze
O humanity! If you had been in doubt about the Upraising, truly, We created you from earth dust and, again, from seminal fluid and, again, from a clot and, again, from tissue that was formed and that was not formed so that we make it manifest to you. We establish in the wombs whom We will for a term, that which is determined. And, again, We bring you out as infant children and, again, you may reach the coming of age. And among you there is he whom death will call to itself. And among you there is he who is returned to the most wretched lifetime so that he knows not anything after some knowledge. And thou hast seen the earth as that which is lifeless. Yet when We caused water to descend on it, it quivered and it swelled and put forth every lovely pair
That is because God, He is The Truth, and it is He Who gives life to the dead and He is Powerful over everything
And, truly, the Hour is that which arrives. There is no doubt about it and that God will raise up whoever is in the graves
And among humanity is such a one who disputes about God without knowledge nor guidance nor an illuminating Book
turning to his side as one who turns away to cause to go astray from the way of God. For him in the present is degradation. And We will cause him to experience—on the Day of Resurrection— the punishment of the burning
That is because of what thy two hands put forward! And, truly, God is not unjust to His servants
And among humanity is he who worships God on the fringes. If good lit on him, he is at rest with it. And if a test lit on him, he turned completely about. He lost the present and the world to come. That, it is the clear loss
He calls to other than God what neither hurts him nor profits him. That, it is a far wandering astray
He calls to him whose hurting is nearer than his profiting. Miserable was the defender and miserable was the acquaintance
Truly, God will cause to enter those who have believed and did as the ones accord with morality, Gardens beneath which rivers run. Truly, God accomplishes what He wants
Whoever had been thinking that God will never help him, in the present and in the world to come, let him stretch out a cord to heaven. Again, let him sever it. Then, let him look on whether his cunning causes to put away what enrages him
And, thus, We caused signs to descend, clear portents. And that God guides whom He wants
Truly, those who believed and those who became Jews and the Sabeans and the Christians and the Zoroastrians and those who ascribed partners—truly, God will distinguish between them on the Day of Resurrection. Truly, God over everything is a Witness
Hast thou not considered that to God prostrates to Him whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in and on the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars, the mountains, the trees and the moving creatures, and many of humanity while there are many on whom the punishment will be realized. And He whom God despises, then, there is no one who honors him. Truly, God accomplishes whatever He wills.‡
These two disputants strove against one another about their Lord. Then, for those who were ungrateful garments of fire will be cut out for them. Over their heads, scalding water will be unloosed
whereby what is in their bellies will be dissolved and their skins
And for them are maces of iron
Whenever they wanted to go forth from there because of lament, they will be caused to return to it and experience the punishment of the burning
Truly, God will cause to enter those who believed and did as ones in accord with morality, Gardens beneath which rivers run. They are adorned in them with bracelets of gold and pearls. And their garments in it will be of silk
And they were guided to what is good of the saying and they were guided to the Path of Him Who is Worthy of Praise
Truly, those who were ungrateful and bar from the way of God and from the Masjid al-Haram that We made for humanity—equal for the ones who give themselves up and the ones who are desert dwellers—and whoever wants to violate it with injustice, We will cause him to experience a painful punishment
And mention when We placed Abraham in the place of the House that: Thou wilt ascribe nothing as partners with Me. And Thou purify My House for the ones who circumambulate it and the ones who are standing up, and the ones who bow down and the ones who prostrate themselves
Announce to humanity the pilgrimage to Makkah. They will approach thee on foot and on every thin camel. They will approach from every deep ravine
that they bear witness to what profits them and remember the Name of God on known days over whatever He provided them from flocks of animals. Then, eat of it and feed the ones who are in misery and the poor
Again, let them finish their ritual cleanliness and live up to their vows and circumambulate the Ancient House
That was commanded! Whoever holds the sacred things of God in honor, then, that is better for him with his Lord. And permitted to you were the flocks, but what will be recounted to you. So avoid the disgrace of graven images and avoid saying the untruth
Turn to God as monotheists not with Him as ones who are polytheists. And whoever ascribes partners with God, it is as if he fell down from heaven and the birds snatch him or the wind hurled him to ruin in a place far away
That was commanded! Whoever holds the waymarks of God in honor, then, it is, truly, from hearts filled with God-consciousness
For you in that is what profits for a term, that which is determined. Again, their place of sacrifice is at the Ancient House
And for every community We assigned devotional acts that they may remember the Name of God over what We provided them of flocks of animals. And your God is One God. Submit to Him, and give thou good tidings to the ones who humble themselves
those who, when God was remembered, their hearts took notice and the ones who remain steadfast against whatever lit on them and the ones who perform the formal prayer and who spends out of what We provided them
We made for you the beasts of sacrifice among the waymarks of God. You have in them much good so remember the Name of God over them, ones who are standing in ranks. Then, when they collapsed on their sides, eat from them and feed the ones who are paupers and the ones who are poor persons who beg not. Thus, We caused them to be subservient to you so that perhaps you will give thanks
Neither their flesh nor their blood attains to God, rather, God-consciousness from you attains Him. Thus, He caused them to be subservient to you that you magnify God in that He guided you. And give thou good tidings to the ones who are doers of good
Truly, God defends those who believed. Truly, God loves not any who is an ungrateful betrayer
Permission was given to those who are fought against because they, they were wronged. And, truly, Powerful is God to help them
those who were driven out from their abodes without right because they say: Our Lord is God! If not for God driving back humanity, some by some other, cloisters would be demolished and churches and synagogues and mosques in which is remembered in it the Name of God frequently. Truly, God will help whoever helps Him. Truly, God is Strong, Almighty
Those who, if We established them firmly on the earth, they performed the formal prayer and they gave the purifying alms and they commanded to that which is honorable and they prohibited that which is unlawful. And with God is the Ultimate End of the command
And if they deny thee, surely, the folk of Noah denied before thee and Ad and Thamud
and the folk of Abraham and the folk of Lot
and the companions of Midian. And Moses was denied, but I granted indulgence to the ones who are ungrateful. Again, I took them and how had been My disapproval
And how many a town We caused to perish while they are ones who are unjust so that it be one that had fallen down in ruins and how much well water ignored and a tall palace
Journey they not through the earth? Have they not hearts with which to be reasonable or ears with which to hear? Truly, it is not their sight that is in darkness, but their hearts that are within their breasts that are in darkness
And seek they that thee hasten the punishment? And God never breaks His Promise. And, truly, a day with thy Lord is as a thousand years of what you number
How many a town I granted indulgence while it is one that is unjust. Again, I took it and to Me was the Homecoming
Say: O humanity! Truly, I am only a clear warner to you
So those who believed and did as ones in accord with morality, for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
And those who endeavored against Our signs, ones who strive to thwart, those are the Companions of Hellfire
And We sent not before thee any Messenger nor Prophet, but when he fantasized, Satan cast fantasies into him. But God nullifies what Satan casts. Again, God set clear His signs. And God is Knowing, Wise
for He makes what Satan casts a test for those who in their hearts is a sickness and their hearts, ones that harden. And, truly, the ones who are unjust are in a wide breach
And those who were given the knowledge know that it is The Truth from thy Lord, so that they believe in it and humble their hearts to Him. And, truly, God is One Who Guides those who believed to a straight path
And those who were ungrateful cease not to be hesitant about it until the Hour approaches them suddenly or the punishment approaches them on a withering Day
On that Day the dominion will belong to God. He will give judgment between them. So those who believed and did as the ones accord with morality will be in Gardens of Bliss
And those who were ungrateful and denied Our signs, for them will be a despised punishment
And those who emigrated in the way of God, then, they were slain or died, certainly, God will provide them a fairer provision. And, truly, God, certainly, He is Best of the ones who provide
Certainly, He will cause them to enter a gate with which they will be well-pleased. And, truly, God is, certainly, Knowing, Forbearing
That is so! And whoever chastises for injustice with the like of what he was chastised, and, again, suffered an injustice, God will, certainly, help him. Truly, God is Pardoning, Forgiving
That is because God causes the nighttime to be interposed into the daytime and He causes the daytime to be interposed into the nighttime. And, truly, God is Hearing, Seeing
That is because God, He is The Truth. And what they call to other than Him, it is falsehood. And that God, He is The Lofty, The Great
Hast thou not considered that God caused water to descend from heaven? Then, in the morning, the earth becomes green. Truly, God is Subtle, Aware
To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. And, truly, God, He is The Sufficient, The Worthy of Praise
Hast thou not considered that God caused to be subservient to you what is in and on the earth? And the boats run through the sea by His command. And He holds back the heaven so that it not fall on the earth, but by His permission. Truly, to humanity God is Gentle, Compassionate
And it is He Who gave you life and, again, He will cause you to die and, again, He will give you life. Truly, the human being is ungrateful
For every community We assigned devotional acts so that they be ones who perform rites. So let them not bicker with thee in the command. And call thou to thy Lord. Truly, Thou art on a guidance, that which is straight
And if they disputed with thee, then, thou say: God is greater in knowledge about what you do
God will give judgment among you on the Day of Resurrection about what you had been at variance in it
Hast thou not known that God knows what is in the heaven and the earth? Truly, that is in a Book. Truly, that is easy for God
And they worship other than God, that for which He sent not down any authority and of what they have no knowledge. And there is no helper for the ones who are unjust
And when Our signs are recounted to them, clear portents, thou wilt recognize on the faces of those who were ungrateful, that they are the ones who are rejected. They are about to rush upon those who recount Our signs to them. Say: Shall I tell you of worse than that? God promised the fire to those who were ungrateful. And miserable will be the Homecoming
O humanity! A parable was propounded, so listen to it. Truly, those whom you call to other than God will never create a fly, even if they were gathered together for it. And when the fly is to rob them of something, they would never seek to deliver it from the fly. Weak were the ones who are seekers and the ones who are sought
They duly measured not the measure of God. Truly, God is Strong, Almighty
God favors from the angels messengers and from humanity. Truly, God is Hearing, Seeing
He knows what is in advance of them, and what is behind them, and to God all matters are returned
O those who believed! Bow down and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord, and accomplish good so that perhaps you will prosper.‡
And struggle for God in a true struggling. He elected you and made not for you in your way of life any impediment. It is the creed of your father Abraham. He named you the ones who submit to God before and in this Recitation that the Messenger be a witness over you and you are witnesses over humanity. So perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and cleave firmly to God. He is your Defender. How excellent a Defender and how excellent a Helper
Surely, the ones who believe prospered
those, they, who in their formal prayers are ones who are humble
and they, those who from idle talk, are ones who turn aside
and they, those who the purifying alms are ones who do give
and they, those who of their private parts, are ones who guard
but from their spouses or from what their right hands possessed. Truly, they are ones who are irreproachable
Whoever was looking for something beyond that, then, those, they are the ones who turn away
And those, they who their trusts and their compacts are ones who shepherd
and those, they who over their formal prayers are watchful
those, they are ones who will inherit
those who will inherit Paradise, they are ones who will dwell in it forever
And, certainly, We created the human being from an extraction of clay
Again, We made him into seminal fluid in a stopping place, secure
Again, We created a clot from seminal fluids. Then, We created tissue from the clot. Then, We created bones from tissue. Then, We clothed the bones with flesh. Again, We caused another creation to grow. So blessed be God, the Fairer of the ones who are creators
Again, truly, after that, you will die
Again, truly, you will be raised up on the Day of Resurrection
Certainly, We created above you seven tiers. We had not been ones who are heedless of the creation
We caused water to descend from heaven in measure and We ceased it to dwell in the earth. And We certainly are ones who have power to take away
And We caused to grow for you gardens of date palm trees and grapevines where there is much sweet fruit for you and you eat of it
and a tree that goes forth from Mount Sinai that bears oil and a seasoning for the ones who eat it
And, truly, for you in the flocks there is a lesson. We satiate you with what is in their bellies. In them are many profits and of them you eat
and on them and on boats you are carried
And, certainly, We sent Noah to his folk. And he said: O my folk! Worship God! You have no other god but Him. Will you not, then, be Godfearing
But said the Council who were ungrateful among his folk: This is nothing but a mortal like you. He wants to gain superiority over you. If God willed He would have caused angels to descend. We heard not such a thing from our fathers, the ancient ones
He is nothing but a man in whom there is madness. So watch him for a while
He said: My Lord! Help me because they denied me
So We revealed to him: Craft thou the boat under Our eyes and by Our revelation. Then, when Our command drew near and the oven boiled, then, insert two pairs of each kind and thy people, but whomever against whom the saying has preceded. And address Me not for those who did wrong. Truly, they are ones who are drowned
When thou and whoever is with thee art seated in the boat, then, say: All Praise belongs to God Who delivered us from the folk, the ones who are unjust
And say: My Lord! Land Thou me with a blessed landing for Thou art Best of the landing-places
Truly, in this there are signs and, truly, We had been ones who test
Again, We caused to grow another generation after them
We sent a Messenger to them from among them saying that: Worship God! You have no god other than Him. Will you, then, not be Godfearing
And said the Council of his folk to those who were ungrateful and denied the meeting in the world to come, and to whom We gave ease in this present life: This is nothing but a mortal like you. He eats of what you eat and he drinks of what you drink
And if you obeyed a mortal like yourselves, truly, then, you are ones who are losers
Promises He that when you died and had been earth dust and bones, that you will be ones who are brought out
Begone! Begone with what you are promised
There is nothing but this present life. We die and we live and we shall not be ones who are raised up
He is nothing but a man. He devised a lie against God and we are not ones who will believe in him
He said: My Lord! Help me because they denied me
He said: In a little while they will become ones who are remorseful
Then, a Cry duly took them so We made them into refuse. So away with the folk, the ones who are unjust
Again, We caused to grow after them other generations
No community precedes its term, nor delays it
Again, We sent Our Messengers one after another. Whenever drew near a community a Messenger to them, they denied him. So We caused some of them to pursue others and We made them tales. So away with the folk who believe not
Again, We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and clear authority
to Pharaoh and his Council. Then, they grew arrogant and they had been a folk, ones who exalt themselves
Then, they said: Will we believe in two mortals like ourselves while their folk are ones who worship us
So they denied both of them. They had been among the ones who are caused to perish
And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book so that perhaps they will be truly guided
And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign, and We gave them refuge on a hillside, a stopping place, and a spring of water
O you Messengers! Eat of what is good and do as one in accord with morality. Truly, I am Knowing of what you do
And, truly, this, your community is one community and I am your Lord so be Godfearing
Then, they cut their affair of unity asunder into sects among them, each party glad with what was with them
So forsake thou them for a while in their obstinacy
Assume they that with the relief We furnish them of wealth and children
We compete for good deeds for them? Nay! They are not aware
Truly, those, they are dreading their Lord, ones who are apprehensive
And those, they who believe in the signs of their Lord
and those, they who ascribe nothing as partners with their Lord
and those who give what they gave with their hearts afraid because they are ones who will return to their Lord
are those who compete with one another in good deeds and they, in them, are ones who take the lead
And We place not a burden on any soul but to its capacity. And from Us is a Book that speaks The Truth for itself. And they will not be wronged
Nay! Their hearts are in obstinacy towards this Quran and they have other actions besides as they are ones who act
until, when We took ones who are given ease with the punishment. That is when they make entreaties
Make not entreaties this Day. Truly, you will not be helped from Us
Surely, My signs had been recounted to you, but you had been receding on your heels
as ones who grow arrogant regarding it and ones who nightly talk nonsense, talking foolishly
Meditate they not on the saying or drew not near them anything that approaches not their fathers, the ancient ones
Or is it they recognize not their Messenger so that they are ones who reject him
Or say they: There is madness in him? Nay! He drew near them with The Truth, but most of them are ones who dislike The Truth
And if The Truth followed their desires, the heavens and the earth would have gone to ruin and whoever is in it. Nay! We brought them their Remembrance, but they, from their Remembrance, are ones who turn aside
Or is it that thou hast asked them for payment? Yet the revenue from thy Lord is better. And He is Best of the ones who provide
And, truly, thou hast called them to a straight path
And, truly, those who believe not in the world to come are ones who move away from the path
And even if We had mercy on them and removed the harm which is on them, they would still be resolute in their defiance, wandering unwilling to see
And, certainly, We took them with the punishment. Then, they gave not into their Lord nor lower themselves
until, when we opened a door for them of a severe punishment. That is when they were ones who are seized with despair
And He it is Who caused you to grow, have the ability to hear and sight and mind. But you give little thanks
It is He Who made you numerous on the earth and to Him you will be assembled
And it is He Who gives life and causes to die and His is the alteration of nighttime and daytime. Will you not, then, be reasonable
Nay! They said the like of what the ancient ones said
They said: When we are dead and had been earth dust and bones, will we be ones who are raised up
Certainly, we were promised this—we and our fathers—before this. This is nothing but the fables of the ancient ones
Say: To whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it if you had been knowing
They will say: To God! Say: Then, will you not recollect
Say: Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Sublime Throne
They will say: It belongs to God! Say: Then, will you not be Godfearing
Say: In whose hand is the kingdom of everything and He grants protection? No one is granted protection against Him if you had been knowing
They will say: It belongs to God! Say: How, then, are you under a spell
Nay! We brought them The Truth and, truly, they are ones who lie
God took not to Himself any son, nor had there been any god with Him. For, then, each god would have taken away what he created. And some of them would have ascended over some others. Glory be to God above all that they allege
He is the One Who Knows the unseen and the visible. Exalted be He above partners they ascribe
Say: My Lord! If Thou wilt cause me to see what they are promised
then, assign me not, my Lord, to the folk, the ones who are unjust
And, truly, We cause thee to see what We promise them as certainly ones who have power
Drive thou back evil deeds with what is fairer. We are greater in knowledge of what they allege
And say: My Lord! I take refuge with Thee from the evil suggestions of the satans
And my Lord, I take refuge with Thee so that they not attend me
Until when death drew near one of them, he said: My Lord! Return me
so that perhaps I will do as one in accord with morality in what I left behind. No indeed! Truly, it is only a word that one who converses says. And ahead of them is a barrier until the Day they are raised up
When the trumpet will be blown, there will be no talk of kindred among them that Day nor will they demand anything of one another
Then, whose balance was heavy with good deeds, those, they are the ones who prosper
And among ones whose balance was made light, then, those are those who lost themselves. They will be ones who will dwell in hell forever
Their faces will fry in the fire. And they will be ones who are morose in it
Be not My signs recounted to you, yet you had been denying them
They will say: Our Lord! Our misgiving prevailed over us. We had been a folk, ones who go astray
Our Lord! Bring us out of this. Then, if ever we reverted, truly, we will be ones who are unjust
He would say: Be driven away in it and speak not to Me
Truly, there had been a group of people of My servants who say: Our Lord! We believed, so forgive us and have mercy on us for Thou art Best of the ones who are most merciful
But you took them to yourselves as a laughing-stock until they caused you to forget My Remembrance and you had been laughing at them
Truly, I gave recompense this Day for what they endured patiently. Truly, they, they are the ones who are victorious
He said: Lingered you in expectation on the earth for what number of years
They said: We lingered in expectation a day or some of a day. So ask the ones who count
He said: You lingered in expectation not but a little. If you had but been knowing
Assumed you that We created you in amusement and that to Us you would not be returned
So exalted be God! The King, The Truth. There is no god but He, the Lord of the Generous Throne
And whoever calls to another god with God of which he has no proof, then, truly, his reckoning is with his Lord. Truly, the ones who are ungrateful will not prosper
And say: My Lord! Forgive and have mercy and Thou art Best of the ones who are most merciful
This is a Chapter of the Quran that We caused to descend and We imposed laws in it. We caused to descend signs, clear portents, so that perhaps you will recollect
The one who is an adulteress and the one who is an adulterer, scourge each one of them one hundred strokes. And let not tenderness for them take you from the judgment of God, if you had been believing in God and the Last Day. And let them bear witness to their punishment by a section of the ones who believe
The one who is an adulterer will not marry but one who is an adulteress, or one who is a female polytheist. And the one who is an adulteress will not marry but one who is an adulterer, or one who is a male polytheist. All that was forbidden to the ones who believe
And those who accuse the ones who are free, chaste (f) and, again, bring not four witnesses, then, scourge them eighty strokes and never accept their testimony. And those, they are the ones who disobey
But those who repented after that and made things right, so, truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
And those who accuse their spouses—and there be no witnesses but themselves—let the testimony of one of them be four testimonies sworn to God that he is among the ones who are sincere
and a fifth that the curse of God be on him, if he had been among the ones who lie
And it will drive off the punishment from her if she bears witness with four testimonies sworn to God that he is among the ones who lie
and the fifth, that the anger of God be on her if he had been among the ones who are sincere
And if it were not for the grace of God on you and His mercy and that God is Accepter of Repentance, Wise—
truly, those who drew near with the calumny are many among you. Assume it not worse for you. Nay! It is good for you. To every man of them is what he deserved of sin. And as for those who turned away towards the greater part from among them, there will be a tremendous punishment for him
Why not when you heard about it, thought not the ones who are male believers and the ones who are female believers the better of themselves and have said: This is a clear calumny
Why brought they not about four witnesses for it? As they bring not about witnesses, then, with God, those, they are the ones who lie
If it not were for the grace of God on you and His mercy in the present and in the world to come, certainly, would have afflicted you a tremendous punishment for what you muttered
When you received it on your tongues and said with your mouths of what there is no knowledge, you assume it insignificant while it is serious with God
And why, when you heard it, said you not: It will not be for us to assert this. Glory be to Thee! This is a serious false charge to harm the reputation of another
God admonishes you that you shall never revert to the like of it, if you had been ones who believe
And He makes manifest for you the signs. And God is Knowing, Wise
Truly, those who love that indecency be spread about those who believed, they will have a painful punishment in the present and in the world to come. And God knows and you know not
And if it were not for the grace of God on you and His mercy, you would be ruined, and that God is Gentle, Compassionate
O those who believed! Follow not in the steps of Satan. And whoever follows in the steps of Satan, then, truly, he commands depravity, and that which is unlawful. And if it were not for the grace of God on you and His mercy, none of you would ever be pure in heart, but God makes pure whom He wills. And God is Hearing, Knowing
Let those imbued with grace not forswear—and those with plenty among you—to give to those imbued with kinship and to the needy and the ones who emigrate in the way of God. And let them pardon and let them overlook. Love you not that God should forgive you? And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Truly, those who accuse the ones who are free, unwary, chaste female believers were cursed in the present and the world to come and for them will be a serious punishment
on a Day when their tongues bear witness against them and their hands and their feet as to what they had been doing
On that Day God will pay them their account in full, what is their just due. And they will know that God, He is The Clear Truth
The bad females are for the bad males and the bad males are for the bad females. And who are good females are for who are good males and who are good males are for who are good females. Those are ones declared innocent of what others say. For them is forgiveness and generous provision
O those who believed! Enter not houses other than your houses until you announced your presence and greeted the people within. That is better for you so that perhaps you will recollect
And if you find not in it anyone, then, enter them not until permission be given to you. And if it was said to you: Return, then, return. It is purer for you. And God is Knowing of what you do
There is no blame on you in entering houses without ones who are inhabitants wherein you have enjoyment. And God knows what you show and what you keep back
Say to the males, ones who believe, to lower their sight and keep their private parts safe. That is purer for them. Truly God is Aware of what they craft
And say to the females, ones who believe to lower their (f) sight and keep their (f) private parts safe and show not their (f) adornment but what is manifest of it. And let them (f) draw their head coverings over their (f) bosoms; and not show their (f) adornment but to their (f) husbands or their (f) fathers or the fathers of their (f) husbands or their sons or the sons of their (f) husbands or their (f) brothers or the sons of their (f) brothers or the sons of their (f) sisters or their (f) women, or what their (f) right hands possessed, or the ones who heed, imbued with no sexual desire among the men or small male children to whom was not manifest nakedness of women. And let them (f) not stomp their feet so as to be known what they (f) conceal of their adornment. And turn to God altogether for forgiveness. O the ones who believe, so that perhaps you will prosper
And wed the single among you to the ones in accord with morality of your male bond servants and your female bond servants. If they be poor, God will enrich them of His grace. And God is One Who is Extensive, Knowing
Let those who find not the means for marriage have restraint until God enriches them of His grace. And for those who are looking for emancipation from among what your right hands possessed, contract with them if you knew good in them. And give them of the wealth of God which He gave you. Compel not your spiritual warriors (f) against their will to prostitution when they (f) wanted chastity, that you be looking for the advantage of this present life. And whoever compels them (f) to it against their (f) will, yet after their (f) compulsion, God will be of them (f), the female, Forgiving, Compassionate
And, certainly, We caused to descend to you manifest signs and a parable of those who passed away before you and an admonishment for ones who are Godfearing
God is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The parable of His Light is as a niche in which there is a lamp. The lamp is in a glass. The glass is as if it had been a glittering star, kindled from a blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western, whose oil of the olive is about to illuminate although no fire touches it. Light on light, God guides to His Light whom He wills! And God propounds parables for humanity, and God is Knowing of everything
The Light is lit in houses God gave permission to be lifted up and that His Name be remembered in it. Glorifying Him at the first part of the day and the eventide
are men whom neither trade nor trading diverts from the remembrance of God and the performing the formal prayer and the giving of purifying alms for they fear a Day when the hearts will go to and fro and their sight
that God gives recompense to them according to the fairer of what they did and increases even more for them from His grace. And God provides to whom He wills without reckoning
As for those who were ungrateful, their actions are like a mirage in a spacious plain. The thirsty one assumes it to be water until he drew near it. He finds it to be nothing. Instead, he found God with him Who paid his account in full, reckoning and God is Swift at reckoning
Or they are like the shadows in an obscure sea, overcome by a wave, above which is a wave, above which are clouds, shadows, some above some others. When he brought out his hand he almost sees it not. And whomever God assigns no light for him, there is no light for him
Hast thou not considered that glorifies God whatever is in the heavens and the earth and the birds, ones standing in ranks? Each knew its formal prayer and its glorification. And God is Knowing of what they accomplish
And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And to God is the Homecoming
Hast thou not considered how God propels clouds and, again, brings what is between them together? Again, He lays them into a heap. Thou hast seen the rain drops go forth in the midst. And He sends down from the heaven mountains of rain in which there is hail. And He lights it on whom He wills and turns away from it whom He wills. The gleams of His lightning almost take away the sight
God turns around and around the nighttime and the daytime. Truly, in this is a lesson for those imbued with insight
God created every moving creature from water. Among them there is what walks on its belly and of them there is what walks on two feet and of them there is what walks on four. God creates what He wills. Truly, God is Powerful over everything
Certainly, We caused manifest signs to descend. And God guides whom He wills to a straight path
And they say: We believed in God and the Messenger, and we obeyed. Again, a group of people among them turn away after this. And those are not of the ones who believe
And when they were called to God and His Messenger to give judgment among them, then, a group of people among them are ones who turn aside
But if they would be in the right, they would approach him as ones who are yielding
Is there a sickness in their hearts? Or were they in doubt? Or be they fearful that God and His Messenger will be unjust to them? Nay! Those, they are the ones who are unjust
The only saying of the ones who believe had been—when they were called to God and His Messenger that He give judgment between them—to say: We heard and obeyed. And those, they are the ones who prosper
And whoever obeys God and His Messenger and dreads God and is Godfearing, those, they are the ones who are victorious
And they swore by God their most earnest oaths that if thou wouldst command them, they would go forth. Say: Swear not; honorable obedience is better. Truly God is Aware of what you do
Say: Obey God and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away, then, on him was only what was loaded on him, and on you was only what was loaded on you. And if you obey him, you will be truly guided. And there is not a duty on the Messenger but the delivering of the clear message
God promised those who have believed among you and did as the ones in accord with morality, that He will make them successors in the earth, even as He made of those before them successors and He will establish for them their way of life firmly by which He was content with them and He will substitute a place of sanctuary in place of their fear: They shall worship Me—ascribe nothing as partners with Me. And whoever was ungrateful after that, then, those, they are the ones who disobey
And perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and obey the Messenger so that perhaps you will find mercy
Assume not those who were ungrateful that they are ones who will frustrate Him in the region. Their place of shelter will be the fire and how miserable the Homecoming
O those who believed! Let them ask permission—those whom your right hands possessed (f) and those who reach not puberty—three times: Before the dawn formal prayer, when you lay down your garments at the time of noon and after the time of night formal prayer. These are the three times of privacy for you. There is not on you nor on them blame after these. Other than these, go about some of you with some others. Thus, God makes manifest to you the signs. And God is Knowing, Wise
When infant children were fully grown among you, then, let them ask permission as asked permission those who were before them. Thus, God makes manifest for you His signs. And God is Knowing, Wise
And women who are past child-bearing, those who hope not for marriage, there is no blame on them (f) if they lay down their (f) garments, not as ones who flaunt themselves and their (f) adornment. And that they have restraint is better for them (f), and God is Hearing, Knowing
There is no fault on the blind nor fault on the lame nor fault on the sick nor on yourselves that you eat from your houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your paternal aunts or the houses of your maternal uncles or the houses of your maternal aunts or of that for which you possess its keys or your ardent friend. There is no blame on you that you eat altogether or separately. But when you entered houses, then, greet one another with a greeting from God, one that is blessed and what is good. Thus, God makes manifest for you the signs so that perhaps you will be reasonable
The ones who believe are only those who believe in God and His Messenger. And when they had been with him on a collective matter, they go not until they asked his permission. Truly, those who ask thy permission, those are those who believed in God and His Messenger. So when they ask thy permission for some of their affairs, give permission to whom thou hadst willed of them, and ask God for forgiveness for them. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
The supplication of the Messenger among you is not as the supplication of some of you on some other. Surely, God knows those who slip away under cover. And let those who go against his command beware so that a test should not light on them or a painful punishment not light on them
Surely, to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Surely, He knows what you did. And on the Day when they are returned to Him, then, He will tell them what their hands did, and God is Knowing of everything
Blessed be He Who sent down the Criterion between right and wrong to His servant so that he be a warner to the worlds
He to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Who takes not to Himself a son. There be no ascribed associate with Him in the dominion. And He created everything and ordained it a foreordaining
Yet they took gods to themselves other than Him who create nothing and are themselves created. And they neither possess for themselves hurt nor profit nor have they dominion over death, nor this life, nor rising up
And those who were ungrateful said: This is nothing but a calumny he devised and other folk assisted him. So, surely, they brought about injustice and untruth
And they said: Fables of the ancient ones that he caused to be written down! And they are to be related from memory to him at early morning dawn and eventide
Say: It was caused to descend by He who knows the secret in the heavens and the earth. Truly, He had been Forgiving, Compassionate
And they said: What Messenger is this that he eats food and walks in the markets? Why was an angel not caused to descend to him to be a warner with him
Or why is not a treasure cast down to him or why is there not a garden for him so that he may eat from it? And the ones who are unjust said: You follow nothing but a bewitched man
Look on how they propounded for thee parables for they went astray and are not able to find a way
Blessed be He Who, had He willed, assigned for thee better than that, Gardens beneath which rivers run and He will assign for thee palaces
Nay! They denied the Hour. And We made ready a blaze for whoever denied the Hour
When it saw them from a far place, they heard it raging furiously and roaring
And when they were cast down into it, a troubling place, ones who are chained, they called for damnation
It will be said to them: Call not today for a single damnation, but call for many damnations
Say: Is that better or the Garden of Infinity that was promised the ones who are Godfearing? It had been a recompense for them and a Homecoming
For them in it will be whatever they will, ones who will dwell in it forever. That had been from thy Lord a promise, one that is besought
And on the Day He will assemble them and what they worship other than God. To them He will say: Was it you who caused these My servants to go astray? Or went they astray from the way
They would say: Glory be to Thee! It had not been fit and proper for us to take to ourselves any protectors other than Thee. But Thou hadst given them enjoyment and their fathers until they forgot the Remembrance and had been a lost folk
So, surely, they denied you in what you say. Then, you will neither be able to turn away from it, nor help. And whoever does wrong among you, We will cause him to experience the great punishment
And We sent not before thee any ones who are sent but that, truly, they eat food and walk in the markets. And We made some of you as a test for some others. Will you endure patiently, and thy Lord had been Seeing
Those who hope not for a meeting with Us said: Why were angels not caused to descend to us and why see we not our Lord? Surely, they grew arrogant among themselves, defiant, turning in great disdain
On a Day they will see the angels there will be no good tidings for the ones who sin. And they will say: Unapproachable! Banned
We will advance on whatever actions they did. We will make them as scattered dust
The Companions of the Garden on that Day will have the best resting place and the fairer place of noonday rest
On a Day when heaven will be split open with the cloud shadows and the angels were sent down, a sending down successively
on that Day the true dominion will belong to The Merciful. And it will be a Day difficult for the ones who are ungrateful
And on a Day when one who is unjust will bite his hands, he will say: Would that I took myself to a way with the Messenger
Ah! Woe is me! Would that I take not to myself so-and-so as a friend
Certainly, he caused me to go astray from the Remembrance after it drew near me. And Satan had been a betrayer of the human being
And the Messenger said: O my Lord! Truly, my folk took this, the Quran to themselves, as that which is to be abandoned
And, thus, We assigned for every Prophet an enemy of the ones who sin. And thy Lord sufficed as one who guides and as a helper
And those who were ungrateful said: Why was the Quran not sent down to him all at once? Thus, We will make firm thy mind by it. And We chanted a chanting
And they bring thee no parable. We brought about The Truth to thee and fairer exposition
Those who will be assembled on their faces in hell, those are worse placed, ones who go astray from the way
And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book and assigned his brother Aaron to him as a minister
And We said: You both go to the folk who denied Our signs. Then, We destroyed them, an utter destruction
And the folk of Noah when they denied the Messengers, We drowned them. And We made them as a sign for humanity. And We made ready for the ones who are unjust a painful punishment
and Ad and Thamud and the Companions of Rass and many generations in between that
And We propounded parables for each of them. And We shattered each a shattering
And, certainly, they approached the town where the reprehensible rain was rained down on them. Is it that they see it not? Nay! They had been not hoping for any rising up
And when they saw thee, they take thee to themselves but in mockery: Is this the one whom God raised up as a Messenger
He was about to cause us to go astray from our gods, if it were not that we endured patiently in them! And they will know at the time when they see the punishment, who is one who goes astray from the way
Hadst thou considered him who took to himself his own desires as his god? Wouldst thou, then, be over him a trustee
Or assume thou that most of them hear or are reasonable? They are not but as flocks. Nay! They are ones who go astray from a way
Hast thou not considered how thy Lord stretched out the shade? If He willed, He would make it a place of rest. Again, We made the sun an indicator over it
Again, We seized it to Us an easy seizing
And it is He Who made the nighttime a garment for you and sleep a rest and made the daytime for rising
And it is He Who sent the winds, bearers of good tidings in advance of His Mercy. And We caused to descend undefiled water from heaven
that We give life by it to a lifeless land and with it We satiate. We created flocks on it and many humans
And, certainly, We diversified among them so that they recollect. Then, most of humanity refused everything, but disbelief
And if We willed, We would have raised up a warner in every town
So obey not the ones who are ungrateful and struggle against them thereby with a great struggle
And it is He Who let forth the two seas—this, agreeable and water of the sweetest kind and this, salty, bitter. He made between the two that which was unapproachable, a banned barrier
And it is He Who created a mortal from water and made for him kindred by blood and kin by marriage. And thy Lord had been ever Powerful
And they worship other than God what neither profits them nor hurts them. And the one who is ungrateful had been ever a sustainer against his Lord
And We sent thee not, but as one who gives good tidings and as a warner
Say: I ask of you no compensation for this but that whoever willed should take himself on a way to his Lord
And put thy trust in the Living Who is Undying and glorify His praise. And He sufficed to be aware of the impieties of His servants
He Who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two in six days, again, He turned His attention to the Throne. The Merciful! Ask the aware, then, about Him
And when it was said to them: Prostrate yourselves to The Merciful, they said: And what is The Merciful? Will we prostrate ourselves to what thou hast commanded us? And it increased aversion in them.‡
Blessed be He Who made constellations in the heaven and made in it a light-giving lamp and an illuminating moon
And He it is Who made the nighttime and the daytime to follow in succession for who wanted to recollect, or who wanted thankfulness
And the servants of The Merciful are those who walk on the earth in meekness. And when the ones who are ignorant addressed them, they said: Peace
And those who spend the night with their Lord as ones who prostrate themselves and are upright
and those who say: Our Lord! Turn Thou away the punishment of hell from us. Truly, its punishment will be continuous torment
How evil a habitation and resting place
And those who, when they spent, neither exceed all bounds, nor are they tightfisted, but had been between that, a just stand
Those who call not to another god with God nor kill the soul which God forbade but rightfully, nor commit adultery. And whoever disregards and commits this will meet sinfulness
The punishment will be multiplied for him on the Day of Resurrection. And he will dwell in it forever, as one who is despised
Whoever has repented and believed and whose actions were done as one in accord with morality, for those God will substitute for their evil deeds benevolence. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
And whoever repented and did as one in accord with morality, he, truly, repents to God, turning in repentance
And those who bear not witness to untruth and if they passed by idle talk, they passed by nobly
and those who, when they were reminded of the signs of their Lord, fall not down unwilling to hear and unwilling to see
and those who say: Our Lord! Bestow on us from our spouses and our offspring the comfort of our eyes and make us leaders of the ones who are Godfearing
those will be given recompense in the highest chambers because they endured patiently. They will be in receipt of greetings and peace
ones who will dwell in it forever. Excellent it is for habitation and as a resting place
Say: My Lord would not concern Himself with you if it had not been for your supplication, for, surely, you denied so it will be close at hand
S M\m
That are the signs of the clear Book
Perhaps thou wouldst be one who consumes thyself in grief because they become not ones who believe
If We will, We send down to them from heaven a sign so that perhaps their necks would stay to it, ones that are bent in humility
And there approaches them not any renewed Remembrance from The Merciful but that they had been ones who turn aside from it
Surely, they denied it. So soon the tiding will approach them about what they had been ridiculing
Consider they the earth, how much We caused to develop in and on it of every generous pair
Truly, in that is a sign. Yet most of them had not been ones who believe
Truly, thy Lord, He is, certainly, The Almighty, The Compassionate
And when thy Lord proclaimed to Moses saying that: Approach the unjust folk
a folk of Pharaoh saying: Will they not be Godfearing
He said: My Lord! Truly, I fear that they will deny me
and my breast be narrowed and my tongue will not be loosened. So send for Aaron
And they charge an impiety against me. I fear that they will kill me
He said: No indeed! Both of you go with Our signs. Truly, We will be with you, ones who are listening
And both of you approach Pharaoh and say: We are the Messengers of the Lord of the worlds
so send the Children of Israel with us
Pharaoh said: Raise not we thee up among us as a child? Hadst thou not lingered in expectation with us for many years of thy lifetime
And thou hadst accomplished thy accomplishment that thou hadst accomplished and thou art among the ones who are ungrateful
Moses said: I accomplished it when I was of the ones who go astray
So I ran away from you when I feared you. Then, my Lord bestowed on me critical judgment and made me among the ones who are sent
Beyond this past favor with which thou hast reproached me, thou hadst enslaved the Children of Israel
Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the worlds
Moses said: The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two of them if you had been ones who are certain
Pharaoh said to whoever was around him: Listen you not
Moses said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, the ancient ones
Pharaoh said: Truly, your Messenger who was sent to you is one who is possessed
Moses said: The Lord of the East and the West and whatever is between the two of them if you had been reasonable
Pharaoh said: If thou hadst taken to thyself a god other than me. I will, certainly, assign thee to be imprisoned
Moses said: What if I drew near thee with something that makes it clear
Pharaoh said: Bring it, if thou hast been among the ones who are sincere
So he cast his staff; that is when it was a clear serpent
And he drew out his hand and that is when it was shimmering white to the ones who look
He said to the Council around him: Truly, this is one who is a knowing sorcerer
He wants to drive you out from your region by his sorcery. What is it, then, that you suggest
They said: Put him and his brother off and raise up ones who summon in the cities
They will bring every knowing witch to thee
So the ones who were sorcerers were gathered at a time appointed on a known day
and it was said to humanity: Will you, you be ones who gather together
so that perhaps we follow the ones who are sorcerers if they had been the ones who are victors
So when the ones who are sorcerers drew near, they said to Pharaoh: Is there a compensation for us if we had been the ones who are victors
Pharaoh said: Yes! Truly, you will be the ones who are brought near to me
Moses said to them: Cast what you will as ones who cast
So they cast their ropes and their staffs and said: By the vainglory of Pharaoh, we, we will, surely, be the ones who are victors
Then, Moses cast down his staff. That is when it swallows what they faked
The ones who are sorcerers were cast down, ones who prostrate themselves
They said: We believed in the Lord of the worlds
the Lord of Moses and Aaron
Pharaoh said: You believed in him before I give permission to you? He is, truly, your foremost master who taught you sorcery. Then, you will know. I will, certainly, cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will cause you to be crucified one and all
They said: No grievance. Truly, to our Lord we are ones who are turning
Truly, we are desirous that Our Lord forgive us our transgressions that we had been the first of the ones who believe
And We revealed to Moses saying that: Set thou forth by night with My servants. Truly, you are ones who will be followed
Then, Pharaoh sent to the cities, ones who summon
They said: These are, truly, a small crowd
and, truly, they are ones who enrage us
We are altogether, truly, ones who are cautious
So We drove them out from the gardens and springs
and treasures and a generous station
And We, thus, gave them as inheritance to the Children of Israel
So they pursued them at sunrise
Then, when the two multitudes sighted each other, the Companions of Moses said: Truly, we are ones who are to be overtaken
Moses said: No indeed. Truly, my Lord is with me and He will guide me
Then, We revealed to Moses saying that: Strike the sea with thy staff and it divided and each had been a separate part like a high, tremendous mountain
And, again, We brought the others close
and We rescued Moses and whoever was with him, one and all
Again, We drowned the others
Truly, in this is a sign and yet most of them had not been ones who believe
And, truly, thy Lord, He is The Almighty, The Compassionate
And recount to them the tidings of Abraham
when he said to his father and his folk: What is it you worship
They said: We worship idols. We will stay ones who give ourselves up to them
He said: Hear they when you call them
Or are they profiting you or hurting you
They said: Nay! But we found our fathers acting likewise
He said: Then, considered what you had been worshipping
you and your fathers, the elders
Truly, they are an enemy to me, but not so the Lord of the worlds
Who created me. And it is He Who guides me
And that He Who feeds me and gives me drink
And when I was sick, it is He Who heals me
and Who causes me to die, again, will give me life
and from Whom I am desirous that He will forgive me my transgressions on the Day of Judgment
My Lord! Bestow on me critical judgment and cause me to join with the ones in accord with morality
And assign me a good name of good repute with the later ones
and make me one who inherits the Garden of Bliss
And forgive my father. Truly, he had been among the ones who go astray
And cover me not with shame on a Day they will be raised up
on a Day neither wealth will profit nor children
but he who approached God with a pure-hearted heart
And the Garden will be brought close for the ones who are Godfearing
and hellfire will be advanced for the ones who are in error
And it will be said to them: Where is what you had been worshipping
instead of God? Are you helped by them? Or help they themselves
Then, they were thrown down into it, they and the ones who are in error
and the army of Iblis, one and all
And they said while they are in it striving against one another
By God! Truly, we had been clearly wandering astray
when we made you equal with the Lord of the worlds
And no one caused us to go astray but the ones who sin
Now we have not ones who are intercessors
nor an ardent friend, a loyal friend
Would that there were for us a return again. Then, we would be among the ones who believe
Truly, in this is a sign; yet most of them had not been ones who believe
And, truly, thy Lord, He is The Almighty, The Compassionate
The folk of Noah denied the ones who are sent
when their brother, Noah, said to them: Will you not be Godfearing
Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
so be Godfearing of God and obey me
And I ask you not for any compensation for it. My compensation is only from the Lord of the worlds
So be Godfearing of God and obey you me
They said: Will we believe in thee when it is the most wretched that followed thee
He said: And what knowledge have I of what they had been doing
Truly, their reckoning is but with my Lord if you be aware
I am not one who drives away the ones who believe
I am not but a clear warner
They said: If thou hast not refrained thyself, O Noah, thou wilt, certainly, be among the ones who are stoned
He said: My Lord! My folk denied me
so give Thou deliverance between me and them and victory and deliver me and whoever is with me among the ones who believe
And We rescued him and whoever was with him in the laden boat
Again, We drowned after that the ones who remained
In this is, truly, a sign, yet most of them had not been ones who believe
Thy Lord, He, truly, is The Almighty, The Compassionate
Ad denied the ones who are sent
when their brother Hud said to them: Will you not be Godfearing
Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
so be Godfearing of God and obey me
And I ask you not for any compensation for it. My compensation is only from the Lord of the worlds
Build you a sign on every high hill to amuse
And take you for yourselves castles so that perhaps you will dwell in them forever
And when you seized by force, seized you by force haughtily
So be Godfearing of God and obey me
Be Godfearing of Him Who furnished relief to you with all that you know
He furnished relief to you with flocks and children
and gardens and springs
Truly, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day
They said: It is equal to us whether thou wert to admonish or thou hast not been among the ones who admonish
Truly, this is nothing but morals of the ancient ones
and we are not ones who are punished
So they denied him and We caused them to perish. Truly, in this is a sign yet most of them had not been ones who believe
And, truly, thy Lord, He is, certainly, The Almighty, The Compassionate
And Thamud denied the ones who are sent
when their brother Salih said to them: Will you not be Godfearing
Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
so be Godfearing of God and obey me
And I ask you not for any compensation for it. My compensation is only from the Lord of the worlds
Will you be left ones who are safe in what you have here
in gardens and springs
and crops of slender spathes of date palm trees
Will you carve houses out of the mountains as ones who are skillful
So be Godfearing of God and obey me
Obey not the command of the ones who are excessive
who make corruption in and on the earth and make not things right
They said: Truly, thou art only of the ones against whom a spell is cast
Thou art not but a mortal like us. So bring us a sign if thou hadst been of the ones who are sincere
He said: This is a she camel. She has a right to drink and you have a right to drink on a known day
And afflict her not with evil so that you should take the punishment of a tremendous Day
But they crippled her and, then, it came to be in the morning that they are ones who are remorseful
So the punishment took them. Truly, in this is a sign yet most of them had not been ones who believe
And, truly, thy Lord! He is, certainly, The Almighty, The Compassionate
The folk of Lot denied the ones who are sent
when their brother, Lot, said to them: Will you not be Godfearing
Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
so be Godfearing of God and obey me
And I ask you not for any compensation for it. My compensation is only from the Lord of the worlds
You approach males among worldly beings
forsaking spouses whom your Lord created for you? Nay! You are a folk ones who turn away
They said: If thou hast not refrained thyself, O Lot, thou wilt, certainly, be among ones who are driven out
He said: I am of the ones with hatred for your actions
My Lord! Deliver me and my people from what they do
So We delivered him and his people one and all
but an old woman of the ones who stay behind
Again, We destroyed the others
and We rained down on them a rain. And how evil was the rain for the ones who are warned
Truly, in this is a sign. Yet most of them had not been ones who believe
And, truly, thy Lord, He is, certainly, The Almighty, The Compassionate
The Companions of the Thicket denied the ones who are sent
When Shuayb said to them: Will you not be Godfearing
Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
so be Godfearing of God and obey me
And I ask you not for any compensation for it. My compensation is only from the Lord of the worlds
Live up to the full measure and be not of the ones who cause loss to others by fraud
And weigh with a straight scale
and diminish not to humanity their things nor do mischief in or on the earth as ones who make corruption
And be Godfearing of Him Who created you and the array of the ancient ones
They said: Thou art only ones against whom a spell is cast
And thou art nothing but a mortal like us. And, truly, we think thee to be among the ones who lie
So cause pieces of heaven to drop on us, if you had been among the ones who are sincere
He said: My Lord is greater in knowledge of what you do
But they denied him. So took them the punishment on the overshadowing day. Truly, that had been the punishment of a tremendous Day
Truly, in this is a sign. Yet most of them had not been ones who believe
And, truly, thy Lord, He is, certainly, The Almighty, The Compassionate
And this, truly, is the sending down successively of the Lord of the worlds
that the Trustworthy Spirit brought down
on thy heart that thou be among the one who warn
in a clear Arabic tongue
And, truly, it is in the ancient scrolls of the ancient ones
Would it not be a sign for them that is known to the knowing among the Children of Israel
And if We sent it down to some of the non-Arabs
and he recited it to them, they had not been ones who believe in it
Thus, We thrust it into the hearts of the ones who sin
They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment
Then, it will approach them suddenly while they are not aware
Then, they will say: Are we ones who are given respite
Seek they to hasten Our punishment
Hadst thou considered that if We gave them enjoyment for years
and, again, there drew near them what they had been promised
they would not be availed by what they had been given of enjoyment
We caused no town to perish but that it had ones who warn
as a reminder. And We had not been ones who are unjust
It came not forth by the satans
and neither is it fit and proper for them nor are they able
Truly, they, from having the ability to hear, are the ones who are set aside
So call thou not to any god with God so that thou be among the ones who are punished
And warn thy nearest kin, the kinspeople
And make low thy wing to whoever followed thee among the ones who believe
Then, if they rebelled against thee, then, say: Truly, I am free of what you do
And put thy trust in The Almighty, The Compassionate
Who sees thee at the time thou hast stood up
and thy going to and fro of the ones who prostrate themselves
Truly, He is The Hearing, The Knowing
Will I tell you in whom the satans come forth
They come forth in every sinful false one who gives listen
but most of them are ones who lie
As for the poets, the ones who are in error follow them
Hast thou not considered that they wander in every valley
and that they say what they accomplish not
But those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality remembered God frequently and helped themselves after they were wronged. And those who did wrong will know by which overturning they will be turned about
That are the signs of the Quran and a clear Book
a guidance and good tidings for the ones who believe
those who perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms so that they of the world to come, they are certain
Truly, as for those who believe not in the world to come, We made their actions appear pleasing to them so that they wander unwilling to see
Those are those for whom is the dire punishment and they, in the world to come, they are the ones who are the losers
And, truly, thee, thou art in receipt of the Quran, that which proceeds from the Presence, Wise, Knowing
Mention when Moses said to his people: Truly, I, I observed a fire! I will bring you news from it or I will approach you with a flaming firebrand so that perhaps you would warm yourselves
But when he drew near it, it was proclaimed that: Blessed be He Who is in the fire and Who is around it, and glory be to God, the Lord of the worlds
O Moses! Truly, I alone am God, The Almighty, The Wise
Cast down thy staff. But when he saw it quiver as if it were a snake, he turned as one who draws back to retrace his steps. O Moses! Fear not! The ones who are sent fear not My nearness
but whoever did wrong does. Again, he substituted goodness after evil and, truly, I am Forgiving, Compassionate
Cause thy hand to enter into thy bosom. It will go forth shimmering white without evil. These are among nine signs to Pharaoh and his folk. Truly, they had been a folk, ones who disobey
But when Our signs drew near them, ones who perceive, they said: This is clear sorcery
And they negated them—although their souls confessed to them—out of injustice and self-exaltation. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who make corruption
Certainly, We gave David and Solomon knowledge; and they said: All Praise belongs to God Who gave us advantage over many of His servants, ones who believe
And Solomon inherited from David and he said: O humanity! We were taught the utterance of the birds and everything was given to us. Truly, this is clearly grace
And there was assembled before Solomon his armies of jinn and humankind and birds and they are marching in rank
until when they approached the Valley of the Ants. One ant said: O ants! Enter your dwellings so that Solomon and his armies not crush you while they are not aware
So Solomon smiled as one who laughs at its saying and he said: My Lord! Arouse me that I give thanks for Thy divine blessing with which Thou wert gracious to me and ones who are my parents and that I do as one in accord with morality. May Thou be well-pleased and cause me to enter by Thy Mercy among Thy servants, ones in accord with morality
And he reviewed the birds and said: Why see I not the hoopoe bird? Had it been among the ones who are absent
I will, certainly, punish him with a severe punishment or deal a death blow to it unless it brings me a clear authority
But it was not long in coming. Then, it said: I comprehended what thou hast not comprehended of it. And I drew near thee from Sheba with certain tidings
Truly, I found a woman controlling them. And she was given everything and for her is a sublime throne
I found her and her folk prostrating herself to the sun—instead of God—and Satan made to appear pleasing to them their actions and barred them from the way so they are not truly guided
So they prostrate themselves not to God Who brings out that which is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you speak openly
God, there is no god but He, the Lord of the Sublime Throne.‡
Solomon said: We will look on if thou hadst been sincere or thou art of the ones who lie
Go thou with this letter of mine and cast it to them. Again, turn away from them and look on what they return
She said: O Council! Truly, a generous letter was cast down to me
Truly, it is from Solomon and, truly, it is in the Name of God, The Merciful, The Compassionate
Rise not up against me, but approach me as ones who submit to God
She said: O Council! Render me an opinion in my affair. I had not been one who resolves unless you bear witness
They said: We are imbued with strength and vigorous might, but the command is for thee. So look on what thou wilt command
She said: Truly, when kings entered a town, they made corruption in it and made the most mighty of its people humiliated in spirit. Thus, this is what they accomplish
But, truly, I am one who will send to them a present and will be one who looks with what returns the ones who are sent
So when they drew near Solomon, he said: Are you furnishing me relief with wealth? What God gave me is better than what He gave you. Nay! It is you who should be glad with your present
Return thou to them and We, truly, will approach them with armies against which they will not be capable and we will drive them out from there as ones who are disgraced and they, humble-spirited
He said: O Council! Which of you will bring me her throne before they approach me as ones who submit to God
A demon from among the jinn said: I will bring it to thee before thou wilt stand up from thy station. And, truly, I am strong, trustworthy
Said he who has knowledge of the Book: I will bring it to thee before thy glance goes back to thee. And, then, when he saw that which is settled before him, he said: This is from the grace of my Lord to try me whether I give thanks or am ungrateful. And whoever gave thanks, truly, he gives thanks for himself. And whoever was ungrateful, then, truly, my Lord is Rich, Generous
He said: Disguise her throne for her that we look on whether she will be truly guided or she will be of those who are not truly guided
So when she drew near, it was said: Is thy throne like this? She said: It is as though it had been it. Solomon said: The knowledge was given us before her and we had been ones who submit to the One God
She was barred from worshipping God by what she had been worshipping other than God for, truly, she had been of a folk, ones who are ungrateful
It was said to her: Enter the pavilion. And when she saw it, she assumed it to be a pool and she bared her legs. He said: Truly, it is a smooth, crystal pavilion. She said: My Lord! Truly, I did wrong to myself and I submitted with Solomon to God, the Lord of the worlds
And, certainly, We sent to Thamud their brother, Salih that they worship God! Then, when they became two groups of people striving against one another
he said: O my folk! Why seek you to hasten the evil deed before benevolence? Why ask you not for forgiveness of God so that perhaps you will find mercy
They said: We auger ill of thee and whoever is with thee. He said: That which is your omen is with God. Nay! You are a folk who are being tried
And there had been nine groups of persons in the city who make corruption in the earth and make not things right
They said: Swear to one another by God: We will, certainly, attack him by night and his people. Again, we will, certainly, say to his protector: We bore not witness to the destruction of his people and, truly, we are ones who are sincere
So they planned a plan and We planned a plan while they were not aware
So look on how had been the Ultimate End of their planning! Truly, We destroyed them and their folk one and all
And that are their houses, ones that have fallen down for what they did wrong? Truly, in this is a sign for a folk who know
And We rescued those who believed and had been Godfearing
And Lot, when he said to his folk: You approach indecency and you perceive what you do
Why approach you men with lust instead of women? Nay! You are a folk who are ignorant
Then, there had been no answer by his folk, but that they said: Drive the people of Lot out from your town. Truly, they are a clan to cleanse themselves
So We rescued him and his people, but his woman. We ordained her to be among the ones who stay behind
And We rained down on them a rain. How evil was the rain to the ones who are warned
Say: The Praise belongs to God and peace be on His servants, those whom He favored. Is God better or what they ascribe as partner with God
Who created the heavens and the earth and caused to descend for you from the heavens, water? With it We caused joyous, fertile gardens to develop. It had not been for you to cause their trees to develop. Is there any god besides God? Nay! They are a folk who equate others with God
Who made the earth a stopping place and made rivers in the midst and made firm mountains for it and made between the two sees that which hinders? Is there a god besides God? Nay! But most of them know not
Who answers one who is constrained when he called to Him and He removes the evil and assigns you as vice-regents on the earth? Is there a god besides God? Little is what you recollect
Who guides you in the shadows of the dry land the sea and Who sends the winds, bearer of good news in advance of His mercy? Is there a god besides God? Exalted is God above partners they ascribe with God
Who begins creation, again, will cause it to return and Who provides you from the heaven and the earth. Is there a god besides God? Say: Prepare your proof if you had been ones who are sincere
Say: None knows who is in the heavens and the earth, nor the unseen but God. Nor are they aware when they will be raised up
Nay! Their knowledge of the world to come failed. Nay! They are in uncertainty about it. Nay! They are in the dark about it
And those who were ungrateful said: When we had been earth dust like our fathers will we, truly, be ones who are brought out
Certainly, we were promised this, we and our fathers before. Truly, this is nothing but fables of the ancient ones
Say: Journey through the earth; then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who sin
And feel thou not remorse for them, nor be troubled by what they plan
And they say: When is the promise if you had been ones who are sincere
Say: Perhaps coming close behind you be some of that which you seek to hasten
And, truly, thy Lord is Possessor of Grace for humanity, but most of them give not thanks
And, truly, thy Lord knows what their breasts hide and what they speak openly
Not is that which is absent in the heaven and the earth, but that it is in the clear Book
Truly, this, the Quran, relates about the Children of Israel and most of what they are at variance in it
And, truly, it is a guidance and a mercy for the ones who believe
Truly, thy Lord will decree between them with His determination. And He is The Almighty, The Knowing
So put thy trust in God. Truly, thou art on The Clear Truth
Truly, thou wilt not cause the dead to hear nor wilt thou cause to hear the unwilling to hear the calling to them when they turned as ones who draw back
Nor wilt thou be one who guides the unwilling to see out of their fallacy. Thou wilt not cause to hear, but whoever believes in Our signs and so they are ones who submit to God
And when the saying fell on them, We will bring out a moving creature for them from the earth that will speak to them, that: Humanity had not been certain of Our signs
And on a Day We will assemble a unit out of every community of whoever denies Our signs and they will be marching in rank
Until when they drew near, He will say: Denied you My signs without comprehending them in knowledge, or what is it that you had been doing
And the saying will fall on them because they did wrong. And they will speak nothing for themselves
Considered they not? We made the nighttime for them to rest in it and the daytime for ones who perceive. Truly, in that are signs for a folk who believe
On a Day on which the trumpet will be blown, whoever is in the heavens will be terrified and whoever is on the earth, but him whom God willed. And all will approach Him as ones who are in a state of lowliness
And thou wilt see the mountains thou hast assumed to be that which are fixed. But they will pass by as the passing of the clouds. This is the handiwork of God Who created everything very well. Truly, He is Aware of what you accomplish
Whoever drew near with benevolence, for him will be better than it and they would be from the terror ones who are safe on that Day
And whoever drew near with evil deeds, they would be slung on their faces in the fire: Are you given recompense but for what you had been doing
Truly, I was commanded to worship the Lord of this land which He made sacred and to Whom everything belongs. And I was commanded that I be among the ones who submit to God
and to recount the Recitation. So whoever was truly guided, then, he is truly guided only for himself. And to whoever went astray say: Truly, I am among the ones who warn
And say: The Praise belongs to God. He will cause you to see His signs and you will recognize them. Thy Lord is not One Who is Heedless of what you do
a S M\m
That are the signs of the clear Book
We recount to thee the tiding of Moses and Pharaoh with The Truth for a folk who believe
Truly, Pharaoh exalted himself on the earth and made his people partisans, taking advantage of due to their weakness, a section among them. He slaughters their children and saves alive their women. Truly, he had been of the ones who make corruption
And We want to show grace to those who were taken advantage of due to their weakness on the earth and to make them leaders and to make them the ones who inherit
and to establish them firmly on the earth. And We cause Pharaoh and Haman to see—and their armies from them— that of which they had been fearful
And We revealed to the mother of Moses: Breast feed him. But if thou hadst feared for him, then, cast him into the water of the sea and neither fear nor feel remorse. Truly, We will be ones who restore him to thee, ones who make him among the ones who are sent
Then, the people of Pharaoh picked him out to be an enemy to them and a cause of grief. Truly, Pharaoh and Haman and their armies had been ones who are inequitable
And the woman of Pharaoh said: He will be a comfort to our eyes for me and for thee. Kill him not. Perhaps he may profit us or we may take him to ourselves as a son. But they are not aware
And it came to be in the morning that the mind of the mother of Moses was that which is empty. Truly, she was about to show him, if We had not invigorated her heart so that she became among the ones who believe
And she said to his sister: Track him. So she kept watching him from afar while they are not aware
And We forbade any breast feeding female for him before. Then, she said: Shall I point you to the people of a house who will take control of him for you and they will be ones who will look after him
So We returned him to his mother that her eyes settle down and she not feel remorse and that she knows that the Promise of God is true. But most of them know not
And when he was fully grown, come of age and he straightened himself up, We gave him critical judgment and knowledge. And, thus, We give recompense to the ones who are doers of good
And he entered the city at a time of heedlessness of its people. He found in it two men fighting one against the other. This who was from among his partisans and this who was from among his enemies. The one who was among his partisans cried for help against him who was among his enemies. So Moses struck him with his fist and Moses made an end of him. He said: This is the action of Satan. Truly, he is a clear enemy, one who leads astray
He said: My Lord! Truly, I did wrong to myself so forgive me and He forgave him. Truly, He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate
He said: My Lord! For that with which Thou wert gracious to me I will never be a sustainer of the ones who sin
So he came to be in the morning in the city one who is fearful and is vigilant. That is when the one who had asked for help yesterday cries out aloud to him. Moses said to him: Truly, thou art clearly a hothead
Then, when he wanted to seize by force the one who he was an enemy of both of them—he said: O Moses! Wouldst thou want to kill me as thou hadst killed a soul yesterday? Thou wouldst want nothing, but to be haughty on the earth? And thou wouldst want not to be among the ones who make things right
A man drew near from the farther part of the city, coming eagerly, he said: O Moses! Truly, the Council is conspiring against thee to kill thee, so go forth. Truly, I am the one who gives advice to thee
So Moses went forth from there as one who is fearful, is vigilant. He said: My Lord! Deliver me from the folk, ones who are unjust
When of his own accord he turned his face toward Midian he said: Perhaps my Lord guides me to the right way
And when he went down to the well of Midian, he found a community there of personages drawing water and he found other than them two women who keep away. He said: What is your business? They both said: We draw not water until the ones who are shepherds move on. And our father is an aged, old man
So he drew water for them. Again, he turned away to the shade and said: My Lord! Truly, I am, certainly, of whatever Thou caused to descend of good to me, in need
Then, drew near him one of the two women, walking bashfully. She said: Truly, my father calls to thee that he may give thee recompense of compensation because thou hadst drawn water for us. So when he drew near him and related to him the narrative, he said: Fear not. Thou wert delivered from the folk, ones who are unjust
One of the two women said: O my father! Employ him. Truly, best is that thou wouldst employ the strong, the trustworthy
He said: Truly, I want to wed thee to one of my two daughters if that thou wilt hire thyself to me for eight years. But if thou wert to fulfill ten years, then, it will be from thee, for I want not to press thee hard. Thou wilt find me, if God willed, among the ones in accord with morality
He said: That is between thee and between me whichever of the two terms I satisfied. There will be no deep seated dislike from me. And God is Trustee over what we say
Then, when Moses satisfied the term and journeyed with his people, he observed at the edge of the mount a fire. He said to his people: Abide! Truly, I, I observed a fire so that perhaps I will bring you some news from there or burning wood of fire so that perhaps you will warm yourselves
So when he approached it, it was proclaimed from the right side of the ridge of the valley, in a corner of the blessed ground from the tree: O Moses! Truly, I am God, the Lord of the worlds
Cast thy staff. But when he saw it quiver as if it were a snake, he turned as one who draws back, and he retraces his steps. O Moses! Come forward and fear not. Truly, thou art among the ones who are safe
Insert thy hand into thy bosom. It will go forth shimmering white without evil and clasp thy arm pits against fright. These are two proofs from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his Council. Truly, they had been a folk, ones who disobey
He said: My Lord! Truly, I killed a soul among them and I fear that they will kill me
And my brother Aaron, he is more oratorical in language than I, so send him with me as a helpmate to establish me as true. Truly, I fear that they will deny me
He said: We will strengthen thy arm through thy brother and assign to you both authority so that they reach not out to you both. With Our signs, you two and whoever followed you two will be the ones who are victors
Then, when Moses drew near them with Our signs, clear portents, they said: This is nothing but forged sorcery. We heard not of this from our fathers, the ancient ones
Moses said: My Lord is greater in knowledge of who drew near with guidance from Him and what will be the Ultimate End in the Abode. Truly, the ones who are unjust will not prosper
And Pharaoh said: O Council! I knew not of any god for you other than me so kindle for me, O Haman, a fire on the clay and make a pavilion for me so that perhaps I will peruse the God of Moses. And, truly, I think that he is among the ones who lie
And he grew arrogant, he and his armies, on the earth without right and they thought that they would not be returned to Us
So We took him and his armies and We cast them forth in the water of the sea. So look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who are unjust
We made them leaders. They call to the fire. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will not be helped
And a curse pursued them in the present. And on the Day of Resurrection they will be of the ones who are spurned
And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book, after We caused previous generations to perish as clear evidence for humanity and a guidance and a mercy so that they recollect
And thou hadst not been on the western edge when We decreed the command to Moses and thou hadst not been among the ones who bear witness
But We caused generations to grow and their lifetimes continued to be long. And thou hadst not been one who is a dweller with the people of Midian who recount Our signs to them, but it is We Who had been ones who send
And thou hadst not been at the edge of the mount when We proclaimed, but as a mercy from thy Lord, that thou wast to warn a folk to whom no warner approached them before thee so that perhaps they will recollect
So that if affliction lights on them for what their hands put forward, they say: Our Lord! Why hadst Thou not sent a Messenger to us that we would have followed Thy signs and we would be among the ones who believe
But when The Truth drew near them from Us they said: Why was he not given the like of what was given to Moses? They are ones who are ungrateful for what was given to Moses before. They said: Two kinds of sorcery, each helped one against the other. And they said: Truly, we disbelieve in all of it
Say: Then, bring a Book from God that is better guided than these two that I follow it, if you had been ones who are sincere
But if they respond not to thee, then, know that they only follow their own desires. And who is one who goes astray than whoever followed his own desires without guidance from God? Truly, God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust
And, certainly, We caused the saying to reach them so that perhaps they will recollect
Those to whom We gave the Book before it, they believe in it
And when it is recounted to them, they say: We believed in it. Truly, it is The Truth from our Lord. Truly, even before it we had been ones who submit to God
Those will be given their compensation two times because they patiently endured and drive off evil deeds with benevolence and they spend out of what We provided them
And when they heard idle talk, they turned aside from it and said: To us are our actions and to you are your actions. Peace be to you! We are not looking for the ones who are ignorant
Truly, thou hast not guided whom thou hast loved but God guides whomever He wills. And He is greater in knowledge of the ones who are truly guided
They said: If we follow the guidance with thee, we would be snatched away from our region. Establish We not firmly for them a holy, safe place where all kinds of fruits are collected as provision from that which proceeds from Our Presence? But most of them know not
And how many a town that We caused to perish boasted about its livelihood. And these are their dwellings, not to be inhabited after them but a little. And, truly, We, We had been the ones who inherit
Thy Lord had not been One Who Causes towns to perish until He raises up to their mother-town a Messenger who recounts Our signs to them. We never had been Ones Who Cause towns to perish unless their people are ones who are unjust
And whatever things you were given are enjoyment for this present life and its adornment. And what is with God is better for one who endures. Will you not, then, be reasonable
Is he to whom We promised a fairer promise—and it is one that reaches fulfillment—like him to whom We gave the enjoyment of enjoyment for this present life? Again, on the Day of Resurrection he will be among the ones who are charged
And on that Day He will proclaim to them and will say: Where are My ascribed associates whom you had been claiming
They would say about whom will be realized the saying: Our Lord! These are they whom we led into error. We led them into error even as we erred. We clear ourselves with Thee. They had never been worshipping us
And it would be said: Call to your ascribed associates. Then, they will call to them, but they will not respond to them and they will see the punishment. If only they had been truly guided
And on a Day when He would proclaim to them and He would say: What have you answered to the ones who are sent
Then, the tidings of that day will be in darkness and they will not demand anything of one another
As for him who repented and believed and did as one in accord with morality, then, perhaps he will be among the ones who prosper
And thy Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses. Not for them had there been a choice. Glory be to God and exalted is He above partners they ascribe
And thy Lord knows what their breasts hide and what they speak openly
And He, God, there is no god but He. His is all Praise in the First and in the Last. And His is the determination. And to Him you will be returned
Say: Considered you what if God made the nighttime endless for you until the Day of Resurrection? What god other than God brings you illumination? Will you not, then, hear
Say: Considered you what if God made the daytime endless for you until the Day of Resurrection? What god other than God brings you nighttime wherein you rest? Will you not, then, perceive
And it is out of His mercy that He assigned for you the nighttime and the daytime that you rest in it and that you be looking for His grace and so that perhaps you will give thanks
And on a Day He will proclaim to them and say: Where are My ascribed associates whom you had been claiming
And We will tear out a witness from every community and We will say: Prepare your proof. Then, they will know that The Truth is with God and will go astray from them what they had been devising
Truly, Korah had been of the folk of Moses, but he was insolent towards them. And We gave him of the treasures which truly, the keys of it were a heavy ordeal to many imbued with strength. Mention when His folk said to him: Exult not. Truly, God loves not the exultant
Look for what God gave thee for the Last Abode. And forget not thy share of the present and do good even as God did good to thee. And be not insolent, corrupting in and on the earth. Truly, God loves not the ones who make corruption
Korah said: I was only given it because of the knowledge with me. Knows he not that God caused to perish before him some of the generations who were more vigorous in strength than he and more numerous in multitude yet the ones who sin will not be asked about their impieties
So he went forth to his folk in his adornment. And said those who want this present life: O would that we had the like of what was given to Korah! Truly, he is the possessor of a sublime allotment
And those who were given the knowledge said: Woe to you! The reward for good deeds from God is better for whoever believed and did as ones in accord with morality. And none will be in receipt of it, but the ones who remain steadfast
So We caused to swallow him the earth and his abode! Then, there had been not any faction to help him against God. And he had been of the ones who are helpless
And it came to be in the morning those who had coveted his place but yesterday, say: God extends the provision to whomever He wills of His servants and confines it to whomever He wills. Were it not that God showed grace to us, He would have caused the earth to swallow us; O how the ones who are ungrateful will not prosper
This is the Last Abode that We will assign to those who want not self-exaltation in the earth, nor corruption. And the Ultimate End is for the ones who are Godfearing
Whoever brought about benevolence, for him there will be better than it. And whoever brought about an evil deed, then, not will be given recompense to those who did evil deeds other than for what they had been doing
Truly, He Who imposed the Quran for thee will be one who restores thee to the place of return. Say: My Lord is greater in knowledge of whoever drew near guidance and whoever is clearly wandering astray
And thou hadst been without hope that the Book would be cast down to thee, but as a mercy from thy Lord. Be thou not a sustainer of the ones who are ungrateful
And let them not bar thee from the signs of God after they were caused to descend to thee. And call to thy Lord. And be thou not among the ones who are polytheists
And call not to any god other than God.• There is no god but He! Everything is that which perishes, but His Countenance. To Him is the determination and to Him you will be returned
Alif L[m M\m]
Assumed humanity that they will be left because they say: We believed and they will not be tried
And, certainly, We tried those who were before them. Then, certainly, God knows those who were sincere and knows the ones who lie
Or assumed those who do evil deeds that they will out do Us? How evil is that about which they give judgment
Whoever had been hoping for the meeting with God, then, truly, the term of God is that which arrives. And He is The Hearing, The Knowing
Whoever struggled, he struggles only for himself. Then, truly, God is Sufficient for the worlds
And those who believed and do as ones in accord with morality, certainly, We will absolve them of their evil deeds and We will give recompense for the fairer of what they had been doing
And We charged the human being with goodness to ones who are his parents and if they struggled with thee that thou ascribest partners with Me, that of which for thee there is no knowledge, then, obey them not. To Me is your return and I will tell you of what you had been doing
And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, We will, certainly, cause them to enter among the ones in accord with morality
And of humanity is he who says: We believed in God. But, when he was maligned for the sake of God, he mistook the persecution by humanity for a punishment by God. And if help drew near from thy Lord, they would, surely, say: We had been with you. Is not God greater in knowledge of what is in the breasts of beings
And, certainly, God knows those who believed and, certainly, He knows the ones who are hypocrites
And those who were ungrateful said to those who believed: Follow our way and we will, certainly, carry your transgressions while they are not ones who carry any of their own transgressions. Truly, they are the ones who lie
And, certainly, they will carry their own lading and other ladings with their own ladings. And, certainly, they will be asked on the Day of Resurrection about what they had been devising
And, certainly, We sent Noah to his folk and he lingered in expectation among them a thousand years less fifty years. And the Deluge took them while they were the ones who are unjust
Then, We rescued him and the Companions of the Vessel and made it a sign for the worlds
And when Abraham said to his folk: Worship God and be Godfearing of Him. That would be better for you if you had been knowing
You only worship graven images and not God? And you create calumny? Truly, those whom you worship other than God possess not for you any power to provide for you. So look for the provision from God and worship Him and give thanks to Him. To Him you will be returned
And if you deny, then, surely, communities denied before you. And for the Messenger is not but the delivering of the clear message
Consider they not how God causes the creation to begin and, again, He causes it to return? Truly, that for God is easy
Say: Journey through the earth; then, look on how He began the creation. Again, God will cause the last growth to grow. Truly, God is Powerful over everything
He punishes whom He wills and has mercy on whom He wills. And to Him you will come back
You will not be ones who frustrate Him on the earth nor in the heaven and there is not for you, other than God, either a protector or a helper
And those who disbelieved in the signs of God and the meeting with Him, those gave up hope of My mercy and those, for them there will be a painful punishment
So the answer of his folk had been not but that they said: Kill him or burn him! Then, God rescued him from the fire. Truly, in this are, certainly, signs for a folk who believe
And he said: You take only to yourselves graven images instead of God because of affection among yourselves for this present life. Again, on the Day of Resurrection some of you will disavow some others and some of you will curse some others and your place of shelter will be the fire. And for you there will be no ones who help
So Lot believed in him.• And Abraham said: Truly, I am one who emigrates for my Lord. Truly, He, He is The Almighty, The Wise
And We bestowed Isaac and Jacob on him and We assigned to his offspring prophethood and the Book. We gave him his compensation in the present. And, truly, in the world to come he will be, certainly, among the ones in accord with morality
And Lot, when he said to his folk: Truly, you approach indecency which none who preceded you committed in the worlds
You approach men with lust and sever the way and approach that which is unlawful in your conclave. Then, the answer of his folk had not been but that they said: Bring on us the punishment of God if thou hadst been among the ones who are sincere
He said: My Lord! Help me against the folk, ones who make corruption
And when Our messengers drew near Abraham with the good tidings. They said: Truly, We are ones who will cause to perish the people of this town. Truly, its people had been ones who are unjust
He said: Truly, in it is Lot. They said: We are greater in knowledge of who is in it. We will, truly, deliver him and his family, but his woman. She had been among the ones who stay behind
And when Our messengers drew near Lot, he was troubled because of them and he was concerned for them, distressed, and they said: Neither fear nor feel remorse. Truly, we are ones who will deliver thee and thy family but thy woman. She had been among the ones who stay behind
Truly, we are ones who will cause to descend on the people of this town wrath from heaven because they had been disobeying
And, certainly, We left in it a sign, clear portents for a folk who be reasonable
And to Midian, their brother Shuayb. He said: O my folk! Worship God and hope for the Last Day and do not mischief in and on the earth as ones who make corruption
And they denied him. So the quaking of the earth took them and it came to be in the morning in their abodes, ones who are fallen prostrate
And Ad and Thamud, surely, it became clear to you from their dwellings. Satan made their actions appear pleasing to them and barred them from the way and they had been ones who see clearly
And Korah and Pharaoh and Haman and, certainly, Moses drew near to them with the clear portents, but they grew arrogant on the earth and they had not been ones who take the lead from Us
So We took each of them in his impiety. And of them was he on whom We sent a sand storm and of them was he whom the Cry took and of them was he whom We caused the earth to swallow and of them were some whom We drowned. And God had not been doing wrong to them, but they had been doing wrong themselves
The parable of those who took other than God to themselves as protectors is that of the spider who took a house to itself. But, truly, the frailest of houses is the house of the spider if they had but been knowing
Truly, God knows what thing they call to other than Him. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
And We propound these parables for humanity. And no one is reasonable among them but the ones who know
God created the heavens and the earth with The Truth. Truly, in that is a sign for the ones who believe
Recount what was revealed to thee of the Book and perform the formal prayer. Truly, the formal prayer prohibits depravity and that which is unlawful, and, truly, the remembrance of God is greater. And God knows what you craft
And dispute not with the People of the Book unless in a way that is fairer, but with those who did wrong among them. And say: We have believed in what was caused to descend to us and was caused to descend to you and our God and your God is One and we are ones who submit to Him
And, thus, We caused the Book to descend to thee. And those to whom We gave the Book before will believe in it. And of these, the people of Makkah, there are some who believe in it. And none negates Our signs but the ones who are ungrateful
And neither hadst thou been recounting from any Book before it nor writest thou it with thy right hand for then, certainly, they would have been in doubt, the ones who deal in falsehood
Nay! It is clear portents, signs in the breasts of those who were given the knowledge. And none negate Our signs but ones who are unjust
And they said: Why were signs not caused to descend to him from his Lord? Say: The signs are only with God. I am only a warner, one who makes clear
Suffices for them not that We caused the Book to descend to thee which is recounted to them? Truly, in that is a mercy and a reminder for a folk who believe
Say: God sufficed as a witness between me and between you. He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believed in falsehood and were ungrateful to God, those, they are the ones who are losers
And they seek thee to hasten the punishment! And were it not for a term, that which is determined, the punishment would have drawn near them. And, certainly, it will approach them suddenly while they are not aware
They seek to hasten the punishment and, truly, hell will be that which encloses the ones who are ungrateful
On a Day when the punishment overcomes them from above them and from beneath their feet, He will say: Experience what you had been doing
O my servants who have believed, My earth, truly, is that which is extensive, so worship Me
Every soul is one that experiences death. Again, to Us you will return
And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, We will certainly place them in a settlement in the highest chambers in the Garden, beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in it forever. How excellent is the compensation for the ones who work
those who endured patiently and they put their trust in their Lord
And how many a moving creature carries not its own provision, but God provides for it and for you. And He is The Hearing, The Knowing
And if thou hadst asked them: Who created the heavens and the earth and caused the sun and the moon to be subservient? They will, certainly, say: God. Then, how they are misled
God extends the provision for whom He wills of His servants and confines it for whom He wills. Truly, God is Knowing of everything
And if thou hadst asked them: Who sent down water from heaven and gave life by it to the earth after its death, certainly, they would say: God! Say: The Praise belongs to God! Nay! Most of them are not reasonable
And this present life is not, but a diversion and a pastime. And, truly, the Last Abode is the eternal life if they had been knowing
And when they embarked on the boats, they called to God, ones who are sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him. Then, when He delivered them to dry land, that is when they ascribed partners with God
being ungrateful for what We gave them. So let them take joy for soon they will know
Consider they not that We made a safe, holy place while humanity is being snatched away all around them? Believe they, then, in falsehood and are they ungrateful for the divine blessing
And who does greater wrong than he who devised a lie against God? Or denied The Truth when it drew near him? Is there not in hell a place of lodging for the ones who are ungrateful
And as for those who struggled for Us, We will truly guide them to Our ways. And, truly, God is with ones who are doers of good
Alif L[m M\m]
The Romans were vanquished
in the closer region, and they, after being vanquished, will prevail
within a certain number of years. To God belongs the command before and after. And that Day ones who believe will be glad
with the help of God. He helps whom He wills. And He is The Almighty, The Compassionate
It is the promise of God. God breaks not His Promise, but most of humanity knows not
They know only that which is manifest in this present life. And of the world to come, they are ones who are heedless
Or if they reflect not in themselves, God created not the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two but with The Truth and for a term that is determined. And, truly, most of humanity, in the meeting with their Lord, are, certainly, ones who disbelieve
Or journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before them? They had been superior to them in strength. And they plowed the earth and frequented it more than they frequented it. And drew near them their Messengers with the clear portents. Then, it had not been God doing wrong to them, but they had been doing wrong to themselves
Again, the Ultimate End had been misdeeds for those who did evil, because they denied the signs of God and had been ridiculing them
God begins the creation. Again, He causes it to return. Again, you will be returned to Him
And on a Day when the Hour will be secure, the ones who sin will be seized with despair
And for them among their ascribed associates will not be intercessors and their ascribed associates with God will be ones who disavow them
And on a Day when the Hour will be secure, that Day they will be split up
Then, as for those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, they will be walking with joy in a well-watered meadow
And as for those who are ungrateful and denied Our signs and the meeting of the world to come, those are ones who are charged with the punishment
So glory be to God at the time of the evening hour and at the time when it comes to be the morning
To Him be The Praise in the heavens and the earth and in the evening and at the time of noon
He brings out the living from the dead. And He brings out the dead from the living. And He gives life to the earth after its death. And, thus, you will be brought out
And among His signs are that He created you from earth dust, when, again, you were mortals dispersed
And among His signs are that He created for you spouses from among yourselves, that you rest in them. And He made affection and mercy among you. Truly, in that are certainly signs for a folk who reflect
And among His signs are the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alteration of your languages and hues. Truly, in that are certainly signs for ones who know
And among His signs are your slumbering by nighttime and by daytime and your looking for His grace. Truly, in that are, certainly, signs for a folk who hear
And among His signs are that He causes you to see the lightning in fear and in hope. And He sends water down from heaven and gives life by it to the earth after its death. Truly, in that are, certainly, signs for a folk who are reasonable
And among His signs are that the heaven and the earth are secured for you by His command. When He will call you by a call again from the earth, that is when you will go forth
And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth. All are ones who are morally obligated to Him
And He it is Who begins the creation. Again, He causes it to return and this is insignificant for Him. And His is the Lofty Parable in the heavens and the earth. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
He propounds a parable for you from yourselves. Have you—among those whom your right hands possessed—ascribed associates in what We provided you so that you share as equals and you fear them like your awe for each other? Thus, We explain distinctly the signs to a folk who are reasonable
Nay! Those who did wrong followed their own desires without knowledge. Then, who will guide whom God caused to go astray? And they will not have ones who help
So set thy face towards a way of life as a monotheist. It is the nature originated by God in which He originated humanity. There is no substitution for the creation of God. That is the truth-loving way of life, but most of humanity knows not
Be ones who turn in repentance to Him and be Godfearing and perform the formal prayer and be not among the ones who are polytheists
or of those who separated and divided their way of life and had been partisans, each party is glad with what they have
And when harm afflicted humanity, they call to their Lord as ones who turn in repentance to Him. When He caused them, again, to experience His mercy, that is when a group of people among them ascribe partners with their Lord
for they are ungrateful for what We gave them. Then, take joy; you will know
Or caused We to descend to them an authority that it assert what they had been ascribing as partners with Him
And when We caused humanity to experience mercy, they were glad of it. But when an evil deed lights on them because of what their hands put forward, that is when they are in despair
Consider they that God extends the provision for whom He wills and confines it for whom He wills? Truly, in that are signs for a folk who believe
So give to possessors of kinship rightfully and to the needy and to the traveler of the way. That is better for those who want the Countenance of God. And those, they are the ones who prosper
And what you gave in usury in order that it swell the wealth of humanity swells not with God. And what you gave in purifying alms, wanting the Countenance of God, then, those, they are the ones who will receive manifold
God is He Who created you. Again, He provided for you and, again, He will cause you to die. Again, He will give you life. Is there among your ascribed associates with Him who accomplish anything of that? Glory be to Him! Exalted is He above partners they ascribe
Corruption was manifested on the dry land and the sea because of what the hands of humanity earned. He causes them to experience some of what they did, so that perhaps they will return repentant
Say: Journey through the earth; then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before. Most of them had been ones who are polytheists
So set thy face to the truth-loving way of life before that Day approaches from God and there is no turning back. They will be split up on that Day
Whoever was ungrateful, his ingratitude is on him. Whoever did as one in accord with morality will be arranging provision for themselves
And He gives recompense to those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality from His grace. Truly, He loves not the ones who are ungrateful
Among His signs are that He sends the winds as ones that give good tidings and causes you to experience His mercy and so that the boats run at His command and that you be looking for His grace so that perhaps you will give thanks
And, certainly, We sent Messengers before thee to their own folk. They drew near them with the clear portents. Then, We requited those who sinned. And it had been an obligation on Us to help ones who believe
God is He Who sends the winds so they raise clouds. He extends them in the heaven how He wills and He makes them into pieces until thou hast seen rain drops go forth from their midst. That is when He lit it on whomever He wills of His servants. That is when they rejoice at the good tidings
And, truly, they had been—even before it is sent down on them—before that, ones who are seized with despair
Look on the effects of the mercy of God, how He gives life to the earth after its death! Truly, that! He is One Who Gives Life to the dead and He is Powerful over everything
And if We sent a wind and they saw fields, ones that are yellowing, they would stay ungrateful after that
Then, truly, thou wilt not cause the dead to hear nor wilt thou cause the unwilling to hear, to hear the calling to them when they turned as ones who draw back
And thou art not one who guides the unwilling to see from their fallacy. Thou hast caused none to hear but those who believe in Our signs. And they are ones who submit to God
God is He Who created you in your weakness. Again, after that weakness, He assigned strength; again, after that strength, He assigned weakness and grayness of hair. And He creates what He wills. And He is The Knowing, The Powerful
And on a Day when the Hour is secured for you, the ones who sin will swear that they lingered in expectation not but an hour. Thus, they had been misled
And said those who were given the knowledge and the belief: Certainly, you lingered in expectation by what is prescribed by God until the Day of the Upraising. This is the Day of Upraising, but you had not been knowing
So on that Day will not profit them, those who did wrong, their excuses nor will they ask to be favored
And, certainly, We propounded for humanity in this, the Quran, every kind of parable. But if thou wert to bring about any sign to them, certainly, they who were ungrateful would say: Truly, you are nothing but ones who deal in falsehood
Thus, God sets a seal on the hearts of those who know not
So have thou patience. Truly, the promise of God is True. And let them not irritate thee, those who are not certain in belief
Alif L[m M\m]
There are the signs of the wise Book
a guidance and a mercy to the ones who are doers of good
those who perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and they are certain of the world to come
Those are on a guidance from their Lord. And those, they are the ones who prosper
And of humanity is he who exchanges diversionary conversation to cause others to go astray from the way of God without any knowledge. And he takes it to himself in mockery. Those, for them will be a despised punishment
When Our signs are recounted to him, he turned as one who grows arrogant, as if he had not been hearing them, as if there had been heaviness in his ears. So give him the good tidings of a painful punishment
Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them are Gardens of Bliss
ones who will dwell in them forever. The promise of God is true. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
He created the heavens without any pillars so that you see the heavens. And He cast firm mountains on the earth so that the earth should not vibrate with you. And He disseminated in and on it of all moving creatures. And We caused water to descend from heaven. We caused all generous, diverse pairs to develop in it
This is the creation of God. Then, cause me to see what other than He created? Nay! The ones who are unjust are clearly wandering astray
And, certainly, We gave Luqman wisdom that: Give thanks to God. And whoever gives thanks, gives thanks only for himself. And whoever was ungrateful— then, truly, God is Sufficient, Worthy of Praise
And when Luqman said to his son as he admonishes him: O my son! Ascribe not partners with God. Truly, association with God is, certainly, a tremendous injustice
And We charged the human being about ones who are his parents. His mother carried him in feebleness on feebleness and his weaning is in two years. Give thanks to Me and to ones who are thy parents. And to Me is the Homecoming
But if they both struggled with thee that thou hast ascribed partners with Me of what for thee is no knowledge, then, obey them not. And keep their company in the present as one who is honorable but follow the way of him who was penitent to Me. Again, to Me will be your return and I will tell you of what you had been doing
O my son! Truly, even if it be the weight of a grain of a mustard seed and though it be in a rock or in the heavens or in or on the earth God will bring it. Truly, God is Subtle, Aware
O my son! Perform the formal prayer. And command that which is honorable. And prohibit that which is unlawful. And have thou patience with whatever lit on thee. Truly, that is the constancy of affairs
And turn not thy cheek away from humanity nor walk through the earth exultantly. Truly, God loves not any proud boaster
And be moderate in thy walking and lower thy voice. Truly the most horrible of voices is, certainly, the voice of the donkey
Consider you not that God caused to become subservient to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth and lavished on you His divine blessing, that which is manifest and that which is inward and yet most of humanity is he who disputes about God without knowledge and with no guidance and without an illuminating Book
And when it was said to them: Follow what God caused to descend. They said: Nay! We will follow what we found our fathers on. Even if it Satan had been calling them to the punishment of the blaze
And whoever submits his face to God while he is one who is a doer of good, then, surely, he held fast to the most firm handhold. And to God is the Ultimate End of affairs
And whoever was ungrateful, let not his ingratitude dishearten thee. To Us is their return and We will tell them what they did. Truly, God is Knowing of what is in the breasts
We give them enjoyment for a little while. Again, We will compel them to a harsh punishment
And if thou hadst asked them who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say: God! Say: The Praise belongs to God! But most of them know not
To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Truly, God, He is The Sufficient, The Worthy of Praise
And if trees on the earth were only pens and the sea causes to increase after that with seven more seas that were ink, yet the Words of God would not come to an end. Truly, God is Almighty, Wise
Your creation and your Upraising are not but like that of a single soul. Truly, God is Hearing, Seeing
Hast thou not considered that God causes the nighttime to be interposed into the daytime and causes the daytime to be interposed into the nighttime and caused the sun to become subservient and the moon, each run for a term, that which is determined and that God is Aware of what you do
That is because God, He is The Truth and what they call to other than Him is falsehood. And that God, He is The Lofty, The Great
Hast thou not considered that the boats run through the sea by the divine blessing of God that He causes you to see His signs? Truly in that are signs for every enduring, grateful one
And when a wave overcame them like an overshadowing, they called to God as ones who are sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him. Then, when He delivered them to dry land among them are ones who halt between two opinions. And none negates Our signs but every ungrateful turncoat
O humanity! Be Godfearing of your Lord, and dread a Day when recompense will not be given by a child to one to whom the child is born, nor will one to whom a child is born be one who gives recompense for the one who is born at all. Truly, the promise of God is True so let not this present life delude you nor let the deluder delude you about God
Truly, the knowledge of the Hour is with God. And He sends plenteous rain water down. And He knows what is in the wombs. And no soul is informed of what it will earn tomorrow. And no soul is informed in what region it will die. Truly, God is Knowing, Aware
Alif L[m M\m]
The sending down successively of the Book, there is no doubt in it. It is from the Lord of the worlds
Or they say: He devised it. Nay! It is The Truth from thy Lord that thou warnest a folk to whom no warner approached them before thee, so that perhaps they will be truly guided
God! It is He Who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them in six days. Again, He turned His attention to the Throne. You will have none other than Him as protector and no intercessor. Will you not, then, recollect
He manages every command from the heaven to the earth. Again, it will go up to Him in a day, the span of which had been a thousand years of what you number
That is the One Who Knows of the unseen and the visible, The Almighty, The Compassionate
Who did everything that He created well. And He began the creation of the human being from clay
Again, He made human progeny from the extraction of despicable water
Again, He shaped him and breathed into him His Spirit. And He made for you the ability to hear and sight and minds. But you give little thanks
They said: When we went astray on the earth will we be in a new creation? Nay! In the meeting with their Lord they are ones who disbelieve
Say: The angel of death who was charged with you, will call you to itself. Again, you will be returned to your Lord
And if thou but see when the ones who sin become ones who bend down their heads before their Lord: Our Lord! We perceived and heard. So return us. We will do as ones in accord with morality. Truly, we are now ones who are certain
And if We willed it, We would have, surely, given every soul its guidance, but My saying will be realized. I will fill hell with genies and humanity one and all
Then, experience it. As you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours, truly, We forgot you. And experience the infinite punishment for what you had been doing
Only those believe in Our signs who, when they were reminded of them, fell down, ones who prostrate themselves and glorified the praise of their Lord and they grow not arrogant,‡
whose sides deliberately avoided their sleeping places to call to their Lord in fear and hope. And they spend of what We provided them
No soul knows what was concealed for them of comfort for their eyes as a recompense for what they had been doing
Is he who had been one who believes like he who had been one who disobeys? They are not on the same level
As for those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them are Gardens as places of shelter, hospitality for them for what they had been doing
And as for those who disobeyed, their place of shelter will be the fire. Every time they would want to go forth from there, they would be caused to return to it. And it will be said to them: Experience the punishment of the fire which you had been denying
And, certainly, We will cause them to experience the closer punishment other than the greater punishment so that perhaps they will return
And who does greater wrong than he who was reminded of the signs of His Lord, then, he turned aside from them? Truly, on the ones who sin, We are ones who requite
And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book. So be you not hesitant about meeting Him. And We assigned it as a guidance for the Children of Israel
And We assigned leaders from among them to guide under Our command when they endured patiently. And they had been certain of Our signs
Truly, thy Lord is He Who will distinguish among them on the Day of Resurrection about what they had been at variance in it
Guides them not how many We caused to perish of generations before them amidst whose dwellings they walk? Truly, in that are the signs. Will they not then hear
Consider they not that We drive water to the barren dust of earth? We drive out crops with it from which their flocks eat and they themselves. Will they not, then, perceive
And they say: When is this victory if you had been ones who are sincere
Say: On the Day of Victory there will be no profit for those who disbelieved if they, then, have belief nor will they be given respite
So turn thou aside from them and wait awhile. Truly they are ones who are waiting awhile
O Prophet! Be Godfearing of God and obey not the ones who are ungrateful and the ones who are hypocrites. Truly, God had been Knowing, Wise
And follow what is revealed to thee from thy Lord. Truly, God is Aware of what you had been doing
And put thy trust in God. And God sufficed as a Trustee
And God made not two hearts for any man in his interior. Nor made He your spouses those whom you divorced saying: Be as the back of my mother! Nor made He your adopted sons, your sons. That is but a saying of your mouths. And God says The Truth and He guides to the way
Call to them by the names of their fathers. That is more equitable with God. But if you know not their fathers, they are your brothers in the way of life and your defenders. And there is no blame on you in what mistake you made in it, but what your hearts premeditated. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
The Prophet is closer to the ones who believe than their own souls. And his spouses are their mothers and those imbued through the wombs, blood relations, some of them are closer to some other in what is prescribed by God than the other ones who believe and ones who emigrate, but accomplish what you may for your protectors as ones who are honorable—that which had been inscribed in the Book
Mention when We took a solemn promise from the Prophets and from thee and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary. We took an earnest solemn promise from them
so that He ask the ones who are sincere about their sincerity. He prepared for the ones who are ungrateful a painful punishment
O those who believed! Remember the divine blessing of God to you when armies drew near you and We sent the winds against them and armies you see not. And God had been Seeing of what you do
When they drew near you from above you and from below you and when the sight swerved and the hearts reached the throats and you think thoughts about God
there the ones who believe were tested and were convulsed with a severe convulsing
And when the ones who are hypocrites say, as well as those who in their hearts is a sickness: What God and His Messenger promised is nothing but delusion
And when a section of them said: O people of Yathrib! There is no habitation for you, so return. A group of people ask permission of the Prophet among them saying: Truly, Our houses are exposed. But they were not exposed. They want only to run away
And if entry was forced against them from all areas and, again, they were asked to dissent, they would have given into it and they would not have but briefly hesitated
although, certainly, they made a contract with God before that they would not turn their backs to the enemy. And about their compact with God that had been, they are ones who will be asked
Say: Running away will never profit you that you ran away from death or killing, then, you will be given enjoyment but for a little
Say: Who will save you from harm from God if He wanted evil for you or wanted mercy for you? And they will not find for themselves other than God a protector or a helper
Surely, God knows the ones of you who hold off and the ones who converse with their brothers saying to us: Come on! And they approach not the battle themselves but a little
being covetous of you. Then, when fear drew near, thou wilt see them looking on thee, their eyes rolling like he who is overcome by death. But when their fear went, they abused you with sharp tongues in their covetousness for good things. Those believe not and God caused their actions to fail. And that had been easy for God
They assume the confederates go not, withdrawing. And if the confederates approach you, returning, they would wish they were nomads among the ones who are desert dwellers, asking tidings about you. And if they had been among you, they would fight but a little
Surely, in the Messenger of God there is for you a fairer, good example for those whose hope had been in God and the Last Day and remembered God frequently
When the ones who believe saw the confederates, they said: This is what God and His Messenger promised us and God and His Messenger were sincere. And it increased them not but in belief and to resign themselves to submission to God
Among the ones who believe are men who were sincere in the contracts they made with God. Of them are some who satisfied by fulfilling their vow with death and of them are some who wait awhile. And they substituted not any substitution
so that God gives recompense to the ones who are sincere for their sincerity and punish the ones who are hypocrites had He willed or He turns to them in forgiveness. Truly, God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
God repelled those who were ungrateful in their rage without their attaining any good. And God spared the ones who believe in fighting. And God had been Strong, Almighty
And He caused to descend those who were behind among the People of the Book from their strongholds and He hurled alarm into their hearts so that you kill a group of people and make captives of another group of people
And He gave you their region as an inheritance and their abodes and their wealth and a region you tread not. And God had been Powerful over everything
O Prophet! Say to thy spouses: If you had been wanting this present life and its adornment, then, approach now. I will give you enjoyment and set you (f) free, releasing gracefully
And if you had been wanting God and His Messenger, and the Last Abode, then truly God prepared for the ones who are doers of good among you a sublime compensation
O wives of the Prophet! Whoever of you (f) approaches a manifest indecency, her punishment will be multiplied for her twofold. And that would have been easy for God
And whoever of you (f) is morally obligated to God and His Messenger and do as ones (f) in accord with morality, We will give her her compensation two times over. We made ready a generous provision for her
O wives of the Prophet! There is not among the wives any like you. If you (f) were Godfearing, then, be not soft in your saying so that he become desirous he in whose heart is a sickness, but say (f) a saying of one who is honorable
And settle down (f) in your (f) houses and flaunt (f) not your (f) finery as those who flaunted their finery in the previous Age of Ignorance. And perform (f) the formal prayer and give (f) the purifying alms and obey (f) God and His Messenger. God only wants to cause disgrace to be put away from you—People of the House—and purify you with a purification
And remember (f) what is recounted in your (f) houses of the signs of God and wisdom. Truly, God had been Subtle, Aware
Truly, the males, ones who submit to God and the females, ones who submit to God and the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe and the males, ones who are morally obligated and the females, ones who are morally obligated and the males, ones who are sincere and the females, ones who are sincere and the males, ones who remain steadfast and the females, ones who remain steadfast and the males, ones who are humble and the females, ones who are humble and the males, ones who are charitable and the females, ones who are charitable and the males, ones who fast and the females, ones who fast and the males, ones who guard their private parts and the females, ones who guard and the males, ones who are remember God frequently and the females, ones who remember, God prepared for them forgiveness and a sublime compensation
It had not been for a male, one who believes and a female, one who believes, when God and His Messenger decreed an affair that there be any choice for them in their affair. And whoever rebels against God and His Messenger, certainly, he went astray, clearly wandering astray
And mention when thou hast said to him to whom God was gracious and to whom thou wert gracious: Hold back thy spouse to thyself and be Godfearing of God. But thou hast concealed in thyself what God is One Who Shows and thou hast dreaded humanity whereas God has a better right that thou hast dreaded Him. So when Zayd satisfied the necessary formality, We gave her to thee in marriage so that there be no fault for ones who believe in respect of the spouses of their adopted sons when they (m) satisfied the necessary formality. And the command of God had been one that is accomplished
There had been no fault with the Prophet in what is undertaken by him as a duty from God. This is a custom of God with those who passed away before. And the command of God had been a measured measure
for those who state the messages of God and dread Him and dread none but God, and God sufficed as a Reckoner
Muhammad had not been the father of any men from among you, but he is the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets. And God had been Knowing of everything
O those who believed! Remember God with a frequent remembrance
and glorify Him at early morning dawn and eventide
He it is Who gives blessings to you and His angels that He bring you out of the shadows into the light. And He had been Compassionate to ones who believe
Their greetings on the Day they will meet Him will be: Peace! And He prepared for them a generous compensation
O Prophet! Truly, We sent thee as one who bears witness and as one who gives good tidings and as a warner
and as one who calls to God with His permission and as a light-giving illuminating lamp
And give good tidings to the ones who believe that for them is a great grace from God
And obey not the ones who are ungrateful and the ones who are hypocrites and heed not their annoyance and put thy trust in God. And God sufficed as a Trustee
O those who believed! If you married the females, ones who believe, and, again, divorced them before you touch them (f), then, there is no waiting period to reckon against; so make provision for them (f), and set them (f) free, releasing gracefully
O Prophet! Truly, We have permitted to thee thy spouses (f), those whom thou hadst given their (f) compensation and whom thy right hand possessed from that God gave thee as spoils of war and the daughters of thy paternal uncles and the daughters of thy paternal aunts and the daughters of thy maternal uncles and the daughters of thy maternal aunts those who emigrated with thee and a woman, one who believes, if she bestowed herself on the Prophet. And if the Prophet wanted to take her in marriage—that is exclusively for thee—not for the other ones who believe. Surely, We know what We imposed on them about their spouses and whom their right hands possessed (f) that there be no fault on thee. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
Thou wilt put off whom thou wilt of them (f) and thou will give refuge to whom thou wilt. And whomever thou wilt be looking for of whom thou hadst set aside, there is no blame on thee to receive her again. That is likelier that will be refreshed their (f) eyes and they (f) not feel remorse and may they (f) be well-pleased with what thou hadst given them (f), all of them (f). And God knows what is in your hearts. And God had been Knowing, Forbearing
Women are not lawful for thee in marriage after this, nor that thou wert taking them (f) in exchange for other spouses, even though their (f) goodness impressed thee, but whom thy right hand possessed (f). And God had been watching over everything
O those who believed! Enter not the houses of the Prophet for food unless permission be given to you without being ones who look for the proper time. And when you were called to enter, when you have eaten your meal, then, disperse, and be not one who lingers for conversation. Truly, such had been to harass the Prophet and he is ashamed to ask you to leave. But God is not ashamed before The Truth. And when you asked his wives for sustenance, then, ask them (f) from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their (f) hearts. And it had not been for you to harass the Messenger of God nor marry you his spouses after him ever. Truly, that would have been serious with God
Whether you show anything or conceal it, truly, God had been Knowing of everything
There is no blame on them (f) to converse freely with their (f) fathers nor their (f) sons nor their (f) brothers, nor the sons of their (f) brothers nor the sons of their (f) sisters, nor their (f) women, nor what their (f) right hands possessed. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God had been Witness over everything
Truly, God and His angels give blessings to the Prophet. O those who believed! Give your blessings to him and blessings of peace and invoke peace for him
Truly, those who malign God and His Messenger, God cursed them in the present and in the world to come and prepared for them a despised punishment
And those who malign the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe without their deserving it, surely, they lay a burden on themselves of false charges to harm another’s reputation and a clear sin
O Prophet! Say to thy spouses (f) and thy daughters and the females, ones who believe to draw closer their (f) outer garments over themselves (f). That is more fitting so that they (f) be recognized and not be maligned. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
If the ones who are hypocrites refrain not themselves and those who in their hearts is a sickness and the ones who make a commotion in the city, We will stir thee up against them. Again, they will not be thy neighbors in it, but a little while
They are ones who are cursed. Whenever they were come upon, they were taken and were killed with a terrible slaying
This is a custom of God with those who passed away before. And thou wilt never find in a custom of God any substitution
Humanity asks thee about the Hour. Say: The knowledge of it is only with God. And what will cause thee to recognize that perhaps the Hour be near
Truly, God cursed the ones who are ungrateful and prepared a blaze for them
ones who will dwell in it forever, eternally. They shall not find a protector nor a helper
On a Day when will be turned upside down, their faces in the fire, they will say: O would that we obeyed God and obeyed the Messenger
And they will say: Our Lord! Truly, we obeyed our chiefs and our great ones. They caused us to go astray from the way
Our Lord! Give them double the punishment and curse them with a great cursing
O those who believed! Be not like those who maligned Moses. God declared him innocent of what they said. And he had been well-esteemed with God
O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God and say an appropriate saying
He will make your actions right for you and forgive you your impieties. And whoever obeys God and His Messenger surely, won a triumph, a sublime triumph
Truly, We presented the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to carry it and were apprehensive of it. But the human being carried it. Truly, he had been wrongdoing, very ignorant
God punishes the males, ones who are hypocrites and the females, ones who are hypocrites and the males, ones who are polytheists and the females, ones who are polytheists and God will turn to forgiveness toward the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
The Praise belongs to God. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. And His is The Praise in the world to come. And He is The Wise, The Aware
He knows whatever penetrates into the earth and what goes forth out of it and what comes down from the heaven and what goes up to it. And He is The Compassionate, The Forgiving
And those who were ungrateful said: The Hour will not approach us. Say: Yea! By my Lord, it will, certainly, approach you. He is One Who Knows of the unseen. Not an atom’s weight escapes from Him in the heavens or in and on the earth, be it smaller than that or greater, but that it had been in a clear Book
that He may give recompense to those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality. Those, for them there is forgiveness and a generous provision
But those who endeavored against Our signs as ones who strive to thwart, those, for them there is a punishment of painful wrath
And consider those who were given the knowledge that what was caused to descend to thee from thy Lord. It is The Truth and it guides to a path of The Almighty, The Worthy of Praise
Those who were ungrateful said: Shall we point you to a man who will tell you when you were torn to pieces, ones who are totally torn to pieces? Then, you will be, truly, in a new creation
Devised he a lie against God or is there a madness in him? Nay! Those who believe not in the world to come there is a punishment and a going far astray
Consider they not what is in advance of them and what is behind them of the heaven and the earth? If We will, We could cause the earth to swallow them, or cause to drop on them pieces of heaven. Truly, in this is a sign for every servant, one who turns in repentance
And, certainly, We gave David grace from Us. O mountains! Echo psalms of praise with him and the birds. And We softened iron for him
saying that: Work on full coats of mail and calculate the links. And do as one in accord with morality. Truly, I am Seeing of what you do
And to Solomon We subjected the wind. The first part of the day was a month’s journey and the evening course was a month’s journey. We caused a spring of molten brass to flow for him. And We gave him of the jinn who work in advance of him with the permission of his Lord. Whoever of them swerved from Our command We caused him to experience the punishment of the blaze
They worked for him whatever of sanctuaries he wills—images and basin-like cisterns like water-troughs and cooking pots—ones firmly fixed. People of David! Act with thankfulness. But few of My servants are grateful
Then, when We decreed death for Solomon, nothing pointed out his death to the jinn, but a moving creature of the earth that consumes his scepter. So when he fell down, it became clear to the jinn that if they had been knowing the unseen, they would not have lingered in expectation in the despised punishment
There had, certainly, been for Sheba a sign in their dwelling place. Two gardens on the right and on the left. Eat of the provision of your Lord and give thanks to Him: A good land and a forgiving Lord
But they turned aside, so We sent against them the overwhelming flood, and We substituted for their two gardens, two gardens yielding a sour harvest, and tamarisks, and something of lote-trees here and there
That is how We gave recompense to them because they were ungrateful. And we recompense, but the ungrateful
And We made between them and between the towns which We blessed, that which are manifest towns and We ordained journeying in them. Journey through them as ones who are safe night and day
But they said: Our Lord! Cause a distance between our journeys and they did wrong to themselves. So We made them as tales and We tore them to pieces, a total tearing to pieces. Truly, in that are signs for every enduring grateful one
And, certainly, established as true about them was the opinion of Iblis and they followed him, but a group of people among the ones who believe
There had not been for him any authority over them, but that We know who believe in the world to come from who is in uncertainty of it. And thy Lord is Guardian over everything
Say: Call on those whom you claimed other than God. They possess not the weight of an atom in the heavens nor on the earth, nor have they in either any association, nor among them is there any sustainer of Him
No intercession profits with Him, but for him to whom He gave permission. Until when their hearts were freed from terror, they said: What is it that your Lord said. They said: The Truth. And He is the Lofty, the Great
Say: Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth? Say: God. And, truly, we or you are either on guidance or clearly going astray
Say: You will not be asked of what we sinned, nor will we be asked about what you do
Say: Our Lord will gather us. Again, He will explain The Truth among us and He is The Opener, The Knowing
Say: Cause me to see those whom you caused to join with Him as ascribed associates. No indeed! Nay! He is God, The Almighty, The Wise
And We sent thee not, but collectively for humanity as a bearer of good tidings and a warner, but most of humanity knows not
And they say: When is this promise if you had been ones who are sincere
Say: Yours is the solemn declaration of a Day which you delay not for an hour nor press forward
And those who were ungrateful said: We will never believe in this, the Quran, nor in what was in advance of it, but if thou hast considered when the ones who are unjust who are stationed before their Lord, returning the saying, some of them to some others. Say to those who were taken advantage of due to their weakness to those who grew arrogant: If it were not for you, we would have been ones who believe
Those who grew arrogant would say to those who were taken advantage due to their weakness: Barred we you from guidance after it drew near you? Nay! You had been ones who sin
And would say those who were taken advantage due to their weakness to those who grew arrogant: Nay! It was your planning by nighttime and daytime when you commanded us to be ungrateful to God and to assign rivals to Him. And they will keep their self-reproach secret when they will see the punishment and We assigned yokes around the necks of those who were ungrateful. Are they given recompense but for what they had been doing
We sent not any warner to a town, but that the ones who are given ease said: Truly, in what you were sent, we are ones who disbelieve it
And they said: We are more than you in wealth and in children and we are not ones who are punished
Say: Truly, my Lord extends the provision for whomever He wills and confines it for whom He wills, but most of humanity knows not
And it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you near to Us, but whoever believed and did as one in accord with morality. As for those, for them, the recompense is doubled for what they did and they will live in the highest chambers as one who is safe
And those who endeavor against Our signs, as ones who strive to thwart them, those are ones who are charged with the punishment
Say: Truly, my Lord extends the provision for whomever He wills of His servants and confines for him what He wills. And whatever you spent of anything, He will replace it. And He is Best of the ones who provide
And on a Day He will assemble them altogether. Again, He will say to the angels: Was it these who had been worshiping you
They would say: Glory be to Thee! Thou art our Protector and not they. Nay! They had been worshiping the jinn. Most of them were ones who believe in them
Then, today none of you will possess the power over some others to profit nor hurt and We will say to those who did wrong: Experience the punishment of the fire which you had been denying
When are recounted to them Our signs, clear portents, they said: This is not but a man who wants to bar you from what your fathers had been worshipping. And they said: This is not but a forged calumny. And those who were ungrateful for The Truth said when it drew near them: Truly, this is but clear sorcery
And We gave them not any Books that they study them nor sent We to them any warner before thee
Those that were before them denied and they reached not one-tenth of what We gave them. Yet they denied My Messengers. So how had My disapproval of them been
Say: I admonish you in but one thing: That you stand up for God by twos and one by one. Again, reflect. There is not in your companion any madness. He is only a warner to you of a severe punishment in advance of you
Say: Whatever compensation I asked of you, that is for you. My compensation is only from God. And He is a Witness over everything
Say: Truly, my Lord hurls The Truth. He is The Knower of the unseen
Say: The Truth drew near and falsehood neither causes to begin nor causes to return
Say: If I went astray, truly, I will only go astray with loss for myself. And if I was truly guided, it is because of what my Lord reveals to me. Truly, He is Hearing, Ever Near
And if thou wouldst see when they would be terrified, when there is no escape and they would be taken from a near place
they would say: We believed in it! But how could they reach it from a place so far away
And, surely, they were ungrateful for it before. And they hurl at the unseen from a far place
And a barrier was set up between them and between that for which they lust just as was accomplished with partisans before. Truly, they had been uncertain, in grave doubt
The Praise belongs to God, One Who is the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the One Who Makes the angels messengers imbued with wings by twos and in threes and fours. He increases in creation what He wills. Truly, God is Powerful over everything
Whatever God may open of mercy to humanity, there is not one who holds it back. And what He holds back, there is not one who sends it after that. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
O humanity! Remember the divine blessing of God on you! Is there anyone who is a creator other than God Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no god but He. Then, how you are misled
And if they deny thee, surely, Messengers before thee were denied. And to God all affairs are returned
O humanity! Truly, the promise of God is true. So let not this present life delude you. And let not the deluder delude you about God
Truly, Satan is an enemy to you so take him to yourselves as an enemy. He calls only his party that they be among the Companions of the Blaze
Those who were ungrateful, for them will be a severe punishment. And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them there is forgiveness and a great compensation
Then, who is there that was made to appear pleasing to him the direness of his actions so that, then, he saw it as fairer. Truly, God causes to go astray whomever He wills and guides whomever He wills. So let not thy soul be wasted in regret for them. Truly, God is Knowing of what they craft
And it is God Who sent the winds so that they raise clouds and We drove them to a dead land and We gave life by them to the earth after its death. Thus, will be the rising
Whoever had been wanting great glory, great glory belongs to God altogether. To Him Words of what is good rise. He exalts the actions of one in accord with morality. But those who plan evil deeds, for them will be a severe punishment. And the planning of those, it will come to nothing
And God created you from earth dust: Again, from seminal fluid. Again, He made you pairs. And no female carries nor brings forth her burden but with His Knowledge. No one who is given a long life is given a long life, nor is anything reduced from his lifetime but it is in a Book. Truly, that is easy for God
The two bodies of water are not on the same level. This is agreeable, water of the sweetest kind, that which is delicious to drink, and the other is salty, bitter. But from each you eat succulent flesh and pull out glitter that you wear. And thou wilt see the boats, that which plows through the waves on it, that you be looking for His grace and so that perhaps you will give thanks
He causes the nighttime to be interposed in the daytime and He causes the daytime to be interposed into the nighttime and He caused the sun to be subservient and the moon. Each runs its course for a term, that is determined. That is God, your Lord. For Him is the dominion! And those whom you call to other than Him possess not even the white spot of a date stone
If you call to them, they would not hear your supplication. Even if they heard, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection they will disbelieve in your association with them. And none tells thee like One Who is Aware
O humanity! It is you who are poor in relation to God. And God—He is Sufficient, Worthy of Praise
If He wills, He would cause you to be put away and bring a new creation
And that for God is not a great matter
And no burdened soul will bear another’s load. If one who is weighed down calls for help for his heavy load, nothing of it is carried for him, even if he had been possessor of kinship. Hast thou warned only those who dread their Lord in the unseen and performed the formal prayer. And he who purified himself, then, only purifies for himself. And to God is the Homecoming
Not on the same level are the unwilling to see and the seeing
nor are shadows and light
nor are the shade and the torrid heat
Nor are the living and the lifeless on the same level. Truly, God causes to hear whom He wills. And thou art not one who causes to hear whoever is in graves
Thou art but a warner
Truly, We sent thee with The Truth, a bearer of good tidings and a warner. And there is not any community, but a warner passed away among them
And if they deny thee, so, surely, those who were before them denied. Their Messengers drew near them with the clear portents and with the Psalms and the illuminating Book
Again, I took those who were ungrateful. And how had My disapproval of them been
Hast thou not considered that God caused water to descend from the heavens? And, then, We brought out fruits, the ones of varying hues. Among the mountains are white and red streaks—the ones of varying hues—and others raven black
and of humanity and moving creatures and flocks, thus, they are likewise of hues, ones at variance. Only His servants who dread God are knowing. Truly, God is Almighty, Forgiving
Truly, those who recount the Book of God and performed the formal prayer and spent out of what We provided for them secretly and in public, they hope for a trade that will never come to nothing
He will, certainly, pay them their account in full as their compensation and increase them more out of His grace. Truly, He is Forgiving, Ready to Appreciate
And what We revealed to thee of the Book is The Truth, that establishes as true what was in advance of it. Truly, God is Aware, Seeing of His servants
Again, We gave the Book as an inheritance to those whom We favored of Our servants. Then, of them are ones who are unjust to themselves and of them are ones who halt between two opinions and some of them are ones who take the lead with good deeds by permission of God. That is the greater grace
Gardens of Eden—they will enter them. They will be adorned in them with bracelets of gold and pearls. And their garments in them will be silk
And they would say: The Praise belongs to God Who caused grief to be put away from us. Truly, our Lord is Forgiving, Ready to Appreciate
He Who caused us to live in the inhabited Abode out of His grace, fatigue will not afflict us in it, nor will we be afflicted with exhaustion in it
And those who were ungrateful, for them will be the fire of hell: Neither will it be decided a term for them so that they die nor will its punishment be lightened for them. Thus, We give recompense to every ungrateful one
And they will shout aloud in it: Our Lord! Bring us out and we shall do as ones in accord with morality, not what we had been doing! Give We not you a long enough life so that whoever recollects would recollect there? And the warner drew near you, so experience it because there is no helper for ones who are unjust
Truly, God is One Who Knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth. Truly, He is Knowing of what is in the breasts
He it is Who made you viceregents on the earth. So whoever was ungrateful, then, his ingratitude will be against him. And the ones who are ungrateful increase not their ingratitude to their Lord, but in repugnance. And the ones who are ungrateful increase not their ingratitude to their Lord, but in loss
Say: Considered you your ascribed associates to whom you call to other than God? Cause me to see what they created in the earth or have they any association in creation of the heavens? Or gave We them a Book so that they have a clear portent from there? Nay! The ones who are unjust promise nothing—some of them to some others—but delusion
Truly, God holds back the heavens and the earth so that they are not displaced. And if they were displaced, there is none who held them back after Him. Truly, He had been Forbearing, Forgiving
And they swore by God the most earnest oaths, that if a warner drew near them, they would be better guided than any of the other communities. Yet when a warner drew near to them, it increased nothing in them but aversion
growing arrogant on the earth and planning evil deeds. The plan of bad deeds surround none but people themselves. Then, look they on but a custom of the ancient ones? Thou wilt never find in a custom of God any substitution. And thou wilt never find in a custom of God any revision
Journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those before them? They had been stronger than they are in strength. And God had not been weakened by anything in the heavens nor in or on the earth. Truly, He had been Knowing, Powerful
And if God takes humanity to task for what they earned, He would not leave on the back of the earth any moving creature, but He postpones to a term, that is determined. And when their term drew near, then, truly, God had been Seeing of His servants
Y[ S]
By the Wise Quran
truly, thou art among the ones who are sent
on a straight path
sent down successively by The Almighty, The Compassionate that
thou warnest a folk whose fathers were not warned, so they were ones who were heedless
Certainly, the saying was realized against most of them for they believe not
We laid yokes on their necks up to the chins, so that they are ones who are stiff-necked
And We laid in advance of them an embankment and behind them an embankment. Then, We covered them so they perceive not
And equal it is to them whether thou warn them, or thou warn them not. They will not believe
Thou hast only warned whoever followed the Remembrance and dreaded The Merciful in the unseen, so give him good tidings of forgiveness and a generous compensation
Truly, We give life to the dead and We write down what they put forward and their effects. We counted everything in a clear record
And propound a parable for them: The Companions of the Town when ones who were sent drew near them
When We sent to them two, they denied them both, so We replenished them with the third. And they said: Truly, We are ones who are sent to you
They said: You are nothing but mortals like ourselves and The Merciful caused not to descend anything. You are but lying
They said: Our Lord knows that we are ones who are sent to you
On us is only the delivering of the clear message
They said: Truly, we augured ill of you. If you refrain not yourselves, we will, certainly, stone you. Certainly, a painful punishment will afflict you from us
They said: Ones who auger ill will be with you! Is it because you were reminded? Nay! You are a folk, ones who are excessive
A man drew near from the farther part of the city, coming eagerly. He said: O my folk! Follow the ones who are sent
Follow whoever asks not of you any compensation and they are ones who are truly guided
What is it for me that I worship not Him Who originated me and to Whom you will be returned
Will I take gods to myself other than He when, if The Merciful wants any harm for me, their intercession will not avail me at all nor will they save me
Truly, I would, then, be clearly going astray
Truly, I believed in your Lord so hear me
It was said: Enter the Garden. He said: O would that my folk know
that my Lord forgave me and made me one who is honored
After him We caused not to descend on his folk an army from heaven, nor had We been ones who need to cause to descend again
It would be but one Cry and that is when they were ones who are silent and still
O how regrettable of the servants! A Messenger approaches them not, but they had been ridiculing him
Consider they not how many generations We caused to perish before them who, truly, return not to them
And, truly, all of them will be altogether, ones who are charged in Our Presence
And a sign for them is the dead body of the earth. We gave life to it and We brought out grain from it so that they eat from it
We made in them gardens of date palm trees and grapevines and We caused a spring to gush forth in it
so that they may eat of the fruit from there that are not what their hands did. Will they, then, not give thanks
Glory be to Him Who created pairs, all of them, of what the earth causes to develop as well as of themselves and of what they know not
And a sign for them is the nighttime. We pluck the daytime from it and that is when they are ones in darkness
And the sun runs to a resting place for it. That is foreordained by The Almighty, The Knowing
And for the moon We ordained mansions until it reverted like an ripe aged, dry, date stalk
It is not fit and proper for the sun to overtake the moon nor the nighttime one to take the lead over the daytime. They each swim in an orbit
A sign for them is that We carried their offspring in a laden boat
And We created for them of its like that they ride
And if We will, We drown them with none for them to whom they cry aloud for help nor will they be saved
unless it be a mercy from Us and as an enjoyment for a while
And when it was said to them: Be Godfearing of what is in advance of you and what is behind you, so that perhaps you will find mercy
there never approaches them any sign from the signs of their Lord, but they had been ones who turn aside from it
And when it was said to them: Spend of whatever God provided you, those who were ungrateful said to those who believed: Will we feed him whom He would have fed, if He wills? You are nothing, but in a clear going astray
And they say: When is this promise if you had been ones who are sincere
They expect but one Cry which will take them while they strive against one another
Then, they will not be able to leave a legacy nor will they return to their people
And the trumpet would be blown! That is when they will be sliding down to their Lord from their tombs
They would say: Woe on us! Who raised us up from our place of sleep? This is what The Merciful promised and the ones who are sent were sincere
It would be but one Cry. That is when they will be in Our Presence altogether, ones who are charged
This Day no soul will be wronged at all nor will you be given recompense but for what you had been doing
Truly, the Companions of the Garden that Day are ones who are joyful in their engagements
They and their spouses, in shade on raised benches, ones who are reclining
They will have in it sweet fruits and they will have whatever they call for
Peace! A saying from the Compassionate Lord
And be separated on this Day, O ones who sin
Make I not a compact with you, O Children of Adam, that you not worship Satan? Truly, he is a clear enemy
and that you should worship Me. This is a straight path
And, certainly, He caused to go astray many an array of you. Be you not, then, reasonable
This is hell which you had been promised
Roast in it this Day because you had been ungrateful
On this Day We will seal over their mouths and their hands will speak to Us and their feet will bear witness to what they had been earning
And if We will, We would, certainly, have obliterated their eyes. Then, they would race towards the path. How would they have perceived
And if We will, We would, certainly, have transformed their ability. Then, they would not have been able to pass on, nor would they return
And he to whom We give a long life, We bend him over in his constitution. Will they not, then, be reasonable
We taught him not poetry, nor is it fit and proper for him. It is but a Remembrance and a clear Recitation
to warn whoever had been living and that the saying be realized against the ones who are ungrateful
Consider they not how We created for them—out of what Our hands did— flocks, so they were of them ones who are owners
And We subdued them for them so that of them, some are riding animals and some of them, they eat
And they have profits from them and providing a place from which to drink. Will they not, then, give thanks
And they took to themselves gods other than God so that perhaps they will be helped
They are not able to help them while they are to them as a charged army
So let not their saying dishearten thee.• Truly, We know what they keep secret and what they speak openly
Consider not the human being that We created him from seminal fluid? That is when he is a clear adversary
He propounded parables for Us and forgot his own creation. He said: Who will give life to these bones when they decayed
Say: He will give life to them Who caused them to grow the first time and He is The Knowing of every creation
It is He Who made for you fire out of a green tree. That is when you kindle from it
Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth One Who Has Power to create the like of them? Yea! And He is The Knowing Creator
Truly, His command when He wanted a thing is but to say to it: Be! Then, it is
Then, Glory be to Him in whose hand is the Kingdom of everything! And to Him you will be returned
°°°Stage 6 By the ones standing in ranks, ranged in rows
then, ones who scare in a scaring
then, ones who recount the Remembrance
truly, your God is One
the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and the Lord of the sunrise
Truly, We made to appear pleasing the present heaven with the adornment of the stars
and keeping it safe from every emboldened Satan
They pay no attention to the lofty Council for they are hurled at from every edge
rejected. And for them is a punishment, that which lasts forever
but for him who snatched a fragment, then, a piercing flame pursued him
So ask them for advice: Are they stronger in constitution or those others whom We created? Truly, We created them of clinging clay
Nay! Thou hadst marveled while they deride
And when they were reminded, they remember not
And when they saw a sign, they scoff at it
And they said: This is not but clear sorcery
Is it when we were dead and had been earth dust and bones that we will, truly, be ones who are raised up
and our fathers, the ancient ones
Say: Yes, you will be ones in a state of lowliness
There will be only one Scare. So when they will be looking on it
they will say: Woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment
This is the Day of Decision which you had been denying
Assemble those who did wrong and their spouses, and what they had been worshipping
—other than God—and guide them to the path to hellfire
And stop them for they are ones who will be asked
What is the matter with you that you help not one another
Nay! They are on that Day ones who will resign themselves to submission to God
And some of them came forward to some others, demanding of one another
They would say: Truly, you, you had been approaching us from the right
They would say: Nay! You are not ones who believe
and we had not been any authority over you. Nay! You had been a folk, ones who are defiant
So the saying was realized against us of our Lord. That, truly, we are ones who experience the punishment
So we led you into error. Truly, we had been ones who are in error
Then, truly, they will be on that Day ones who are partners in the punishment
We accomplish, thus, with the ones who sin
Truly, when it had been said to them: There is no god but God, they grow arrogant
And they said: Are we ones who leave our gods for a possessed poet
Nay! He drew near with The Truth and he established as true the ones who are sent
Truly, you are ones who will experience the painful punishment
and you will be given recompense but for what you had been doing
But the devoted servants of God
those, for them was a known provision
—sweet fruits—and they will be ones who are honored
in the Gardens of Bliss
on couches—ones who face one another
A cup from a spring of water will be passed around
white, a delight to ones who drink it
In that is neither headache, nor are they intoxicated by it
And with them are ones who are restraining their (f) glance, lovely eyed
as if they are well-guarded pearls
So some of them will come forward to some others, demanding of one another
One of them who converses would say: Truly, I had a comrade
who would say: Art thou of the ones who establish the Resurrection as true
When we are dead and had been earth dust and bones, will we be ones who are judged
He said: Will you be ones who peruse
So he perused and saw him amidst hellfire
He said: By God, thou wert about to deal me destruction
Had it not been for the divine blessing of my Lord I would have been of the ones who are charged
Are we not, then, to be dead again
but for our first death and will we not be ones who are punished
Truly, this, it is the winning the sublime triumph
For the like of this, let the ones who work, work
Is this better as hospitality or the tree of Zaqqum
Truly, We made it a test for the ones who are unjust
Truly, it is a tree that goes forth, its root in hellfire
its spathes have been like the heads of satans
So, truly, they, they are ones who eat from it, ones who fill their bellies with it
Again, truly, on top of that for them is a brew of scalding water
Again, truly, their return is to hellfire
They discovered their fathers ones who go astray
yet they are running in their footsteps
And, certainly, went astray most of the ancient ones before them
And, certainly, We sent among them ones who warn
Then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who are warned
but the devoted servants of God
And, certainly, Noah cried out to Us. And how excellent were the ones who answer
And We delivered him and his people from tremendous distress
And We made his offspring—they, the ones who remain
And We left for him to say with the later ones
Peace be on Noah among the worlds
Thus, We give recompense to the ones who are doers of good
Truly, he is one of Our believing servants
Again, We drowned the others
And, truly, among his partisans was Abraham
When he drew near his Lord with a pure-hearted heart
when he said to his father and to his folk: What is it that you worship
Is it a calumny that you want gods other than God
Then, what is your opinion about the Lord of the worlds
And he looked on them with a glimpse at the stars
and he said: Truly, I am ill
But they turned away from him as ones who draw back
and he turned upon their gods then, said: Will you not eat
Why speak you not for yourselves
Then, he turned upon them, striking them with his right hand
Then, the people came forward towards him rushing
He said: Worship you what you yourselves carve out
while God created you and what you do
They said: Build for him a structure. Then, cast him into hellfire
So they wanted to use cunning against him, but We made them the lowest
He said: Truly, I am one who goes to my Lord. He will guide me
My Lord! Bestow on me among the ones in accord with morality
So We gave him the good tidings of a forbearing boy
And when he reached maturity endeavoring with him, he said: O my son! Truly, I see while slumbering that I am sacrificing thee. So look on what thou hast considered? He said: O my father! Accomplish whatever thou art commanded. Thou wilt find me, if God willed, of the ones who remain steadfast
Then, when they both submitted themselves to God and he flung him on his brow
We cried out to him: O Abraham
Surely, thou hadst established the dream as true. Thus, We give recompense to the ones who are doers of good
Truly, that was, certainly, the clear trial
And, then, We took ransom for him with a sublime slaughter
and We left for him a good name with the later ones
Peace be on Abraham
Thus, We give recompense to the ones who are doers of good
Truly, he is one of Our believing servants
And We gave him the good tidings of Isaac, a Prophet, among the ones in accord with morality
And We blessed him and Isaac. And of their offspring are ones who are doers of good and ones who are clearly unjust to themselves
And, certainly We showed Our grace to Moses and Aaron
And We delivered them and their folk from the tremendous distress
and helped them so that they, they had been the ones who are victors
And We gave them the manifest Book
and guided them to the straight path
We left for them a good name with the later ones
Peace be on Moses and Aaron
Truly, thus, We give recompense to the ones who are doers of good
Truly, they were of Our servants, ones who believe
And, truly, Elijah was of the ones who are sent
when he said to his folk: Will you not be Godfearing
Will you call to Baal and forsake the fairer of ones who are the creators
God, your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers
But they denied him, so they, truly, were ones who are charged
As for the devoted servants of God among them
We left for him a good name with the later ones
Peace be on Elijah
Thus, We give recompense to the ones who are doers of good
Truly, he was of Our servants, ones who believe
And, truly, Lot was of the ones who are sent
We delivered him and his people, one and all
but an old woman of the ones who stay behind
Again, We destroyed the others
And, truly, you pass by them in that which is morning
and at night. Will you not, then, be reasonable
And, truly, Jonah was of the ones who are sent
when he fled, without his Lord’s permission, to the laden boat
He cast lots with them and he had been of the ones who are refuted
Then, the great fish engulfed him while he was one who is answerable
If he had not been of the ones who glorify
he would have lingered in expectation in its belly until the Day they are raised up
Then, We cast him forth on the naked shore while he was ill
We caused a vine of gourd to develop over him
We sent him to a community of a hundred thousand, or they even exceed that
And they believed, so We gave them enjoyment for a while
Then, ask them for advice: Are daughters for thy Lord and for them, sons
Or created We female angels while they were ones who bear witness
Truly, it is out of their calumny that they say
God procreated! And, truly, they are ones who lie
Favored He daughters over sons
What is the matter with you? How you give judgment
Will you not, then, recollect
Or is there for you a clear authority
Then, bring your Book if you would be ones who are sincere
And they made kindred between him and between the genies. But, surely, the genies knew well that they were ones who will be charged
Glory be to God from what they allege
but not the devoted servants of God
So, truly, you and those whom you worship
will not be ones who are tempters against Him
but he who would be one who roasts in hellfire
There is not any of us but he has a known station
And we are ones who are standing in ranks
And we are the ones who glorify
And, truly, they had been saying
Had been with us a Remembrance from the ancient ones
we would have been servants of God, ones who are devoted
but they were ungrateful for it. and soon they will know
And, certainly, Our Word preceded for Our servants, the ones who are sent
They, truly, they are ones who shall be helped
And, truly, Our armies are the ones who are victors
So turn thou away from them for awhile
and perceive them and soon they will perceive
Are they impatient for Our punishment
Then, when it would come down into their courtyard, how evil will be the morning daybreak of the ones who are warned
So turn thou away from them for a while
and perceive and they will perceive
Glory be to thy Lord, the Lord of Great Glory, from what they allege about Him
And peace be to the ones who are sent
And The Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds
By the Quran, Possessor of the Remembrance
Nay! Those who were ungrateful are in vainglory and breach
How many before them have We caused to perish of generations! And they cried out but there was no time for escape for a while
And they marveled that drew near them one who warns from among themselves. And the ones who are ungrateful said: This is one who is a sorcerer, a liar
Made He all gods One God? Truly, this is an astounding thing
And the Council set out from them, saying: Be gone! And have patience with your gods. Truly, this is a thing to be wanted
We heard not the like of this in the later creed. This is only made up tales
Was the Remembrance only caused to descend to him from among us? Nay! They are in uncertainty about My Remembrance. Nay! They experience not My punishment
Or are they owners of the treasures of mercy of thy Lord, The Almighty, The Giver
Or is theirs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them? Let them climb up with cords
Their army is one that is put to flight among the confederates
The folk of Noah before them denied and Ad and Pharaoh, the possessor of the stakes
and Thamud and a folk of Lot and the Companions of the Thicket. Those were the confederates
All of them denied the Messengers so My repayment was realized
These expect not but one Cry. There was no holding it back
And they said: Our Lord! Quicken the sentence of the judge on us before the Day of Reckoning
Have patience with what they say, and remember Our servant David, the possessor of potency. Truly, he was penitent
Truly, We caused the mountains to be subservient to glorify with him in the evening and the rising of the sun
And the birds were ones who are assembled, all penitent to Him
And We strengthened his dominion and gave him wisdom and decisiveness in argument
Approached thee the tiding of the disputants when they climbed over the wall of a sanctuary
When they entered in on David, he was terrified of them. They said: Fear not. Two disputants were insolent, one of us against the other. So give judgment duly between us and transgress not and guide us to the right path
Truly, this is my brother. He has ninety-nine ewe, while I have one ewe. And he said: Place it in my charge and he triumphed over me in argument
David said: Certainly, he did wrong to thee in asking for thy ewe in addition to his ewes. And, truly, many partners in business are insolent, one to another, but those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, and they are few. And David thought that We tried him and he asked for forgiveness of his Lord and fell down as one who bows down penitent.‡
So We forgave him that. And, truly, for him is nearness with Us and goodness of destination
O David! Truly, We made thee a viceregent on the earth so give judgment duly among humanity and follow not your desire for it will cause thee to go astray from the way of God. Truly, those who go astray from the way of God, for them there is a severe punishment because they forgot the Day of Reckoning
And We created not the heaven and the earth and whatever is between the two in falsehood. That is the opinion of those who were ungrateful. Then, woe to those who disbelieved in the fire
Or will We make those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality like the ones who make corruption in and on the earth or will We make the ones who are Godfearing as the ones who acted immorally
It is a blessed Book that We caused to descend to thee, so that they meditate on its signs and those imbued with intuition recollect
And We bestowed Solomon on David. How excellent a servant. Truly, he was penitent
When they were presented before him in the evening—steeds standing with one foot slightly raised—
he said: Truly, I cherished and loved the good instead of remembering my Lord when the sun secluded itself behind the partition of the night
Return them to me. Then, he took wiping over their legs and their necks
And, certainly, We tried Solomon. We cast a lifeless body on his seat. Again, he was penitent
He said: My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me a dominion such will not be fit and proper for another after me. Truly, Thou art The Giver
So We caused the wind to be subservient to him. It runs at his command, a gentle wind, wherever it lit
And We made subservient the satans and every builder and diver
and others, ones who are chained in bonds
This is Our gift. Then, hast thou shown grace or hast thou held back without reckoning
Truly, for him is nearness with Us, and goodness of destination
And remember Our servant Job when he cried out to his Lord: Truly, Satan afflicted me with fatigue and punishment
It is said: Stomp with thy foot. This is a place of washing that is cool and from which to drink
And We bestowed on him, his people, and the like of them along with them as a mercy from Us, a reminder for those imbued with intuition
And take in thy hand a bundle of rushes and strike with it and fail not thy oath. Truly, We found him one who remains steadfast. How excellent a servant. Truly, he was penitent
And remember Our servants Abraham, and Isaac and Jacob, all imbued with dynamic energy and insight
And, truly, We made them sincere with that which is pure, a reminder of the Abode
And, truly, they are to Us among ones who are favored and good
And remember Ishmael, Elisha, and Dhu-l Kifl. And all are among the good
This is a Remembrance. And, truly, for ones who are Godfearing this is, certainly, a goodly destination
the Gardens of Eden, the doors, ones that are opened up for them
Ones who are reclining in them. They will call for many sweet fruits and drink in it
And with them will be ones who are restraining their (f) glance, persons of the same age
This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning
Truly, this is Our provision. For it, there is no coming to an end
This is so. And, truly, for ones who are defiant, there will be a worse destination
hell, where they will roast. And miserable will be the cradling
This is so! Then, let them experience this—scalding water and filth
and other torment of a like kind in pairs
This is an army unit, one that rushes in with you. There is no welcome for them! Truly, they are ones who roast in the fire
They said: Nay! You! There is no welcome for you. It is you who put this forward on us. Miserable will be the stopping place
They said: Our Lord! Whoever put this forward for us, increase him with a double punishment in the fire
And they said: What is the matter with us that we see not men whom we had been numbering among the worst
Took We them to ourselves as a laughing-stock or swerved our sight from them
Truly, this is true of the disagreement of the people of the fire
Say: I am only one who warns. And there is no god but God, The One, The Omniscient
the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, The Almighty, The Forgiver
Say: It is a serious tiding
from which you are ones who turn aside
I had been without knowledge of the lofty Council when they are striving against one another
It is revealed to me only that I am a warner, one who makes clear
Thy Lord said to the angels: Truly, I am one who is Creator of a mortal from clay
So when I shaped him and breathed into him My Spirit, then, fall to him, ones who prostrate themselves
So the angels prostrated themselves, one and all, altogether
but Iblis. He grew arrogant and had been among the ones who are ungrateful
He said: O Iblis! What prevented thee from prostrating thyself to what I created with My two hands? Hadst thou grown arrogant? Or hadst thou been among the ones who exalt themselves
Iblis said: I am better than he. Thou hadst created me from fire while Thou hadst created him from clay
He said: Then, go thou forth from here for, truly, thou art accursed
And, truly, on thee is My curse until the Day of Judgment
Iblis said: My Lord! Then, give me respite until the Day to be raised up
He said: Truly, thou art among the ones who are given respite
until the Day of the known time
Iblis said: By Thy Great Glory, then, I will certainly lead them one and all into error
but Thy devoted servants among them
He said: This is The Truth and The Truth I say
that I will fill hell with thee and with one and all of whoever heeded thee
Say: I ask of you not for any compensation for this nor am I among the ones who take things upon themselves
It is nothing other than a Remembrance for the worlds
and you will, certainly, know its tidings after a while
The sending down successively of this Book is from God, The Almighty, The Wise
Truly, We caused to descend to thee the Book with The Truth so worship God as one who is sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him
The way of life is exclusively for God. And those who took to themselves protectors other than Him say: We worship them not, but that they bring us nearness to God. Truly, God gives judgment between them about what they are at variance in it. Truly, God guides not him, one who lies and is an ingrate
If God wanted to take to Himself a son, He would have favored from what He creates of what He wills. Glory be to Him. He is God, The One, The Omniscient
He created the heavens and the earth with The Truth. He wraps the nighttime around the daytime and wraps the daytime around the nighttime. And He caused to be subservient the sun and the moon, each run for a term, that which is determined. Is He not The Almighty, The Forgiver
He creates you from one soul. Again, He made its mate from it and He caused to descend for you eight pairs of flocks. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, in threefold shadows. Such is God your Lord. His is the dominion. There is no god but He. Why, then, turn you away
If you are ungrateful, truly, God is Independent of you. And He is not well-pleased with ingratitude from His servants. And if you give thanks, He will be well-pleased with you. No burdened soul will bear the heavy load of another. Again, to your Lord is the return, so He will tell you what you had been doing. Truly, He is Knowing of what is in the breasts
And when some distress afflicted the human being, he calls to his Lord as one who turns in repentance to Him. Again, when He granted him divine blessing from Himself, he forgets that for which he had been calling to Him before and he laid on rivals to God to cause others to go astray from His way. Say: Take joy in thy ingratitude for a while. Truly, thou art of the Companions of the Fire
Is he one who is morally obligated during the night watch, one who prostrates himself or one who is standing up in prayer being fearful of the world to come and hoping for the mercy of his Lord? Say: Are those who know on the same level as those who know not? Only those imbued with intuition recollect
Say: O My servants who believed! Be Godfearing of your Lord. For those who did good in the present, there is benevolence, and the earth of God is One Who is Extensive. Only ones who remain steadfast will have their compensation without reckoning
Say: Truly, I was commanded to worship God, one who is sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him
And I was commanded that I be the first of the ones who submit to God
Say: Truly, I fear if I rebelled against my Lord the punishment of a tremendous Day
Say: God alone I worship as one sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him
So worship what you would other than Him. Say: Truly, the ones who are losers are those who lost themselves and their people on the Day of Resurrection. Truly, that is a clear loss
They will have overshadowings above from the fire and beneath them, overshadowings. With that, God frightens His servants. O my servants! Be Godfearing of Me
And those who avoided false deities so that they worship them not and were penitent to God, for them are good tidings. So give good tidings to My servants
those who listen to the saying of the Quran and follow the fairer of it. Those are those whom God guided. And those, they are imbued with intuition
Against whom was realized the word of punishment? Wilt thou be saving him from the fire
But those who were Godfearing of their Lord, for them are the highest chambers with the highest chambers built above them, beneath which rivers run. This is the solemn declaration of God. God never breaks His promise
Hast thou not considered that God caused to descend water from heaven and threaded fountains in the earth, again, brings out crops by it of hues, ones that are at variance? Again, they wither so thou seest them as ones that are growing yellow. Again, He makes them chaff. Truly, in this is a reminder for those imbued with intuition
So is he whose breast God has expanded for submission to God, in a light from His Lord? So woe to their hearts, ones that harden against the Remembrance of God. Those are clearly going astray
God sent down the fairer discourse, a Book, one that is consistent in its often repeated parts of the Quran by which shiver the skins of those who dread their Lord. Again, their skins and their hearts become gentle with the Remembrance of God. That is the guidance of God. With it He guides whom He wills. And whomever God causes to go astray, there is not for him any one who guides
Is he, then, one who fends off a dire punishment with his face on the Day of Resurrection? And it will be said to the ones who are unjust: Experience what you had been earning
Those before them denied and so the punishment approached them from where they are not aware
So God caused them to experience degradation in this present life. But the punishment of the world to come is greater if they had been knowing
And, certainly, We propounded for humanity in this, the Quran, every kind of parable so that perhaps they will recollect
an Arabic Recitation without any crookedness so that perhaps they would be Godfearing
God propounded a parable of a man owned by quarreling ascribed associates and a man belonging to another man. Are they both equal in likeness? The Praise belongs to God. But most of them know not
Truly, thou art mortal and, truly, they are mortal
Again, truly, on the Day of Resurrection before your Lord you will strive against one another
Then, who does greater wrong than one who lied against God and denied sincerity when it drew near him? Is there not in hell a place of lodging for the ones who are ungrateful
And he who brought about sincerity and he who established it as true, those, they are the ones who are Godfearing
For them is all that they will with their Lord. That is the recompense of the ones who are doers of good
Certainly, God absolves them of bad deeds of what they do and gives them recompense in compensation for the fairer of what they had been doing
Is not God One Who Suffices for His servants? They frighten thee with those other than Him. And whom God causes to go astray, there is not for him any one who guides
And whomever God guides, there is not for him anyone who leads astray. Is not God Almighty, The Possessor of Requital
And, truly, if thou hadst asked them: Who created the heavens and the earth? They would, certainly, say: God. Say: Considered you what you call to other than God? If God wanted some harm for me, would they (f) be ones who remove His harm from me? Or if He wanted mercy for me would they (f) be ones who hold back His mercy? Say: God is enough for me. In Him put their trust the ones who put their trust
Say: O my folk! Truly, act according to your ability. I am one who acts. You will know
to whom punishment approaches covering him with shame and on whom alights an abiding punishment
Truly, We caused the Book to descend to thee for humanity with The Truth. So whoever was truly guided, it is only for himself. And whoever went astray, goes astray but for himself. Thou art not over them a trustee
God calls the souls to Himself at the time of their death and those that die not during their slumbering. He holds back those for whom He decreed death and sends the others back for a term, that which is determined. Truly, in that are signs for a folk who reflect
Or took they to themselves other than God intercessors? Say: Even though they had not been possessing anything and they are not reasonable
Say: To God belongs all intercession. His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Again, to Him you will be returned
And when God alone was remembered, the hearts shuddered of those who believe not in the world to come. But when those who, other than Him, were remembered, that is when they rejoice at the good tidings
Say: O God! One Who is Originator of the heavens and the earth! One Who Knows of the unseen and the visible! Thou wilt give judgment among Thy servants about what they had been at variance in it
And if those who did wrong had whatever is in and on the earth altogether and the like with it, they would, truly, have offered it as ransom for the evil punishment on the Day of Resurrection. And it will show itself to them from God what they not be anticipating
And it will show itself to them, the evil deeds that they earned and they will be surrounded by what they had been ridiculing
Then, when harm afflicted the human being, he called to Us. Again, We granted him divine blessing from Us. He would say: I was only given this because of my knowledge. Nay! It is only a test, but most of them know not
Truly, those who were before them said it so what they had been earning availed them not
The evil deeds they earned lit on them. And as for those who did wrong among these, evil deeds of what they earned will light on them. They will not be ones who frustrate Him
Know they not that God extends the provision for whomever He wills and tightens it for whom He wills. Truly, in this are, certainly, signs for a folk who believe
Say: O My servants who exceeded all bounds against themselves, despair not of the mercy of God. Truly, God forgives all impieties. Truly, He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate
Be penitent to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment approaches you. Again, you will not be helped
And follow the fairer of what was caused to descend to you from your Lord before the punishment approaches you suddenly while you are not aware
so that a soul not say: O me that I am regretful for what I neglected in my responsibility to God and that I had, truly, been among the ones who deride
Or he may say: If God guided me, I would, certainly, have been among the ones who are Godfearing
Or he say at the time he sees the punishment: If only I might return again, then, be among the ones who are doers of good
Yea! My signs drew near thee and thou hadst denied them and hadst grown arrogant. Thou hadst been among the ones who are ungrateful
And on the Day of Resurrection thou wilt see those who lied against God, their faces, ones that are clouded over. Is there not in hell a place of lodging for ones who increase in pride
And God delivers those who were Godfearing, keeping them safe. No evil will afflict them, nor will they feel remorse
God is One Who is Creator of everything. And He is Trustee over everything
To Him belongs the pass keys of the heavens and the earth. And those who were ungrateful for the signs of God, those, they are the ones who are the losers
Say: Commanded you me to worship other than God, O ones who are ignorant
And, certainly, it was revealed to thee and to those who were before thee that if thou hast ascribed partners with God, certainly, thy actions will be fruitless and thou wilt, certainly, be among the ones who are losers
Nay! Worship thou God and be thou among the ones who are thankful
And they measured not God with His true measure. And the earth altogether will be His handful on the Day of Resurrection when the heavens will be ones that are rolled up in His right hand. Glory be to Him! And exalted is He above partners they ascribe
And the trumpet will be blown. Then, whoever is in the heavens will swoon and whoever is in and on the earth, but he whom God willed. Again, it will be blown another time. Then, they will be upright looking on
And the earth will shine with the Light of its Lord and the Book will be laid down and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought about. And it will be decided among them with The Truth. And they, they will not be wronged
The account of each soul will be paid in full for what it did. He is greater in knowledge of what they accomplish
Those who were ungrateful will be ones driven to hell in troops until when they drew near it, then, the doors of it will be flung open. Ones who are its keepers will say to them: Approach not Messengers from among you who recount to you the signs of your Lord to warn you of the meeting of this your Day? They would say: Yea. But the word of punishment was realized against the ones who are ungrateful
It will be said: Enter the doors of hell as ones who will dwell in it forever. Miserable it will be as a place of lodging for the ones who increase in pride
Those who were Godfearing will be ones driven to their Lord in the Garden in troops until when they drew near it and its doors were let loose, ones who are its keepers will say to them: Peace be on you! You fared well! So enter it, ones who dwell in it forever
They would say: The Praise belongs to God Who was sincere in His promise to us and gave us the earth as inheritance that we take our dwelling in the Garden wherever we will. How excellent a compensation for the ones who work
And thou wilt see the angels as ones who encircle around the Throne glorifying their Lord with praise. And it would be decided in Truth among them. And it would be said: The Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds
M\m
The sending down successively of this Book is from God, The Almighty, The Knowing
The One Who Forgives impieties, The One Who Accepts remorse, The Severe in Repayment, The Possessor of Bounty. There is no god but He. To Him is the Homecoming
No one disputes the signs of God, but those who were ungrateful. So be thou not disappointed with their going to and fro in the land
The folk of Noah denied before them and the confederates after them. And every community is about to take its Messenger and they dispute with falsehood to refute The Truth. So I took them. And how had been My repayment
And, thus, was the Word of thy Lord realized against those who were ungrateful that they will be the Companions of the Fire
Those who carry the Throne and whoever is around it glorify the praises of their Lord and believe in Him and ask for forgiveness for those who believed say: Our Lord! Thou hadst encompassed everything in mercy and in knowledge. So forgive those who repented and followed Thy way and guard them from the punishment of hellfire
Our Lord! And cause them to enter the Gardens of Eden which Thou hadst promised them and whomever was in accord with morality among their fathers and their spouses and their offspring. Truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Almighty, The Wise
And guard them from the evil deeds. And whomever Thou hast guarded from the evil deeds on that Day. Surely, Thou hadst had mercy on him. And that, it is the winning the sublime triumph
It will be proclaimed to those who were ungrateful: Certainly, the repugnance of God is greater than your repugnance of yourselves when you are called to belief, but you are ungrateful
They said: Our Lord! Thou hadst caused us to die two times and Thou hadst given us life two times. We acknowledged our impieties. Then, is there any way of going forth
It will be said: That is because when God alone was called to, you disbelieved. But when partners are ascribed with Him, you believe. And the determination is with God alone, The Lofty, The Great
It is He Who causes you to see His signs and sends down provision for you from heaven. And none recollect but whoever is penitent
So call you on God ones who are sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him although the ones who are ungrateful disliked it
Exalter of Degrees, Possessor of the Throne, He casts the Spirit by His command on whom He wills of His servants to warn of the Day of the Encounter
a Day when they are ones who depart. Nothing about them will be hidden from God. Whose is the dominion this Day. It is to God, The One, The Omniscient
On this Day every soul will be given recompense for what it earned. There will be no injustice today. God is Swift in reckoning
And warn them of The Impending Day when the hearts will be near the throats, ones who choke. There will not be a loyal friend for ones who are unjust, nor an intercessor be obeyed
He knows that which is the treachery of the eyes and whatever the breasts conceal
And God decrees by The Truth. And those whom they call to other than Him decide not anything. Truly, God, He is The Hearing, The Seeing
Journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who had been before them? They, they had been superior to them in strength and in traces they left on the earth, but God took them for their impieties and there had not been for them one who is a defender from God
That had been because their Messengers approached them with the clear portents, but they were ungrateful so God took them. Truly, He is Strong, Severe in Repayment
And, certainly, We sent Moses with Our signs and a clear authority
to Pharaoh and Haman and Korah. But they said: He is one who is a lying sorcerer
Then, when he drew near with The Truth from Us, they said: Kill the children of those who believed with him and save alive their women. And the cunning of the ones who are ungrateful is but going astray
And Pharaoh said: Let me kill Moses and let him call to his Lord. Truly, I fear that he substitute for your way of life or that he cause to appear in and on the earth corruption
And Moses said: Truly, I took refuge in my Lord and your Lord from everyone who increases in pride and who believes not in the Day of Reckoning
Said a believing man of the family of Pharaoh, who keeps back his belief: Would you kill a man because he says: My Lord is God, and he drew near you with the clear portents from your Lord? And if he be one who lies, then, on him will be his lying. And if he be one who is sincere, then, will light on you some of what he promises. Truly, God guides not him who is one who is excessive, a liar
O my folk! Yours is the dominion this day, ones who are prominent on the earth. But who will help us from the might of God if it drew near us? Pharaoh said: I cause you to see not but what I see and what I guide you to is not but the way of rectitude
And he who believed said: O my folk! Truly, I fear for you like a Day of the confederates
in like manner of a folk of Noah and Ad and Thamud and those after them. And God wants not injustice for His servants
And O my folk! Truly, I fear for you a Day when they would call to one another
a Day when you will turn as ones who draw back. No one saves you from harm from God. And for whomever God causes to go astray, there is not anyone who guides
And, certainly, Joseph drew near you before with the clear portents, but you ceased not in uncertainty as to what he brought about to you. Until when he perished you said: God will never raise up a Messenger after him. Thus, God causes him to go astray, one who is excessive, one who is a doubter
those who dispute the signs of God without any authority having approached them. It is troublesome, repugnant with God and with those who believed. Thus, God sets a seal on every heart of one who increases in pride, haughtiness
And Pharaoh said: O Haman! Build for me a pavilion so that perhaps I will reach the routes
the routes to the heavens, and that I may peruse The God of Moses but, truly, I think that he is one who lies. Thus, it was made to appear pleasing to Pharaoh, the evil of his actions. And he was barred from the way. And the cunning of Pharaoh was not but in defeat
And he who believed said: O my folk! Follow me; I will guide you to the way of rectitude
O my folk! Truly, this present life is nothing but transitory enjoyment and that the world to come is the stopping place, the Abode
Whoever did an evil deed will not be given recompense but the like of it. But whoever did as one in accord with morality, whether male or female, and such is one who believes, then, those will enter the Garden where they will be provided in it without reckoning
And O my folk! What is it to me that I call to you for deliverance and you call to me for the fire
You call to me to be ungrateful to God and to ascribe partners with Him of what there is no knowledge, while I call you to The Almighty, The Forgiver
Without a doubt what you call me to has no merit. It is not a call to the present or to the world to come. And our turning back is to God. And, truly, the ones who are excessive, they will be Companions of the Fire
And you will remember what I say to you. I commit my affair to God. Truly, God is Seeing of the servants
So God guarded him from the evil deeds that they planned while surrounded the people of Pharaoh an evil punishment
The fire to which they are presented the first part of the day and evening. And on a Day when the Hour is secure it is said: Cause the people of Pharaoh to enter the severest punishment
And when they dispute with one another in the fire, the weak will say to those who grew arrogant: Truly, we had been followers of you so will you be ones who avail us from a share of the fire
Those who grew arrogant would say: Truly, we are all in it. Truly, God, surely, gave judgment among His servants
And those in the fire would say to ones who are keepers of hell: Call to your Lord to lighten the punishment for us for a day
They would say: Be bringing not your Messengers the clear portents. They would say: Yea! They would say: Then, you call. And the supplication of the ones who are ungrateful only goes astray
Truly, We will, certainly, help Our Messengers and those who believed in this present life and on a Day when the ones who bear witness will stand up
a Day when their excuses will not profit the ones who are unjust. And for them will be the curse and for them will be an evil abode
And, certainly, We gave Moses the guidance and We gave as inheritance to the Children of Israel the Book
as a guidance and a reminder for those imbued with intuition
So have thou patience. Truly, the promise of God is true. And ask for forgiveness for thy impiety. And glorify thy Lord with praise in the evening and the early morning
Truly, those who dispute about the signs of God without any authority having approached them, there is nothing but having pride in their breasts. They will never be ones who reach its satisfaction. So seek refuge in God. Truly, He, He is The Hearing, The Seeing
Certainly, the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of humanity, yet most of humanity knows not
Not on the same level are the unwilling to see and the seeing nor those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and the ones who are evil doers. Little do they recollect
Truly, the Hour is that which arrives. There is no doubt about it, yet most of humanity believes not
And your Lord said: Call to Me; I will respond to you. Truly, those who grow arrogant toward My worship, they will enter hell as ones who are in a state of lowliness
God is He Who made for you the nighttime so that you may rest in it and the daytime for one who perceives. Truly, God is Possessor of Grace to humanity, but most of humanity gives not thanks
That is God, your Lord, the One Who is Creator of everything. There is no god but He. Then, how you are misled
Thus, are misled those who had been negating the signs of God
God is He Who made the earth for you as a stopping place and the heaven as a canopy. And He formed you and formed you well and He provided you of what is good. That is God, your Lord. Then, blessed be God, the Lord of the worlds
He is The Living! There is no god but He! So call to Him, ones sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him. The Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds
Say: Truly, I was prohibited from worshipping those whom you call to other than God, because the clear portents drew near me from my Lord. And I was commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds
He it is Who created you from earth dust, again, from seminal fluid, again, from a clot. Again, He brings you out as infant children. Again, you come of age and are fully grown. Again, you be an old man. And of you is he whom death calls to itself before, and that you reach a term, that which is determined so that perhaps you will be reasonable
He it is Who gives life and causes to die. And when He decreed an affair, He only says to it: Be! Then, it is
Hast thou not considered those who dispute about the signs of God, where they are turned away
Those who denied the Book and that with which We sent Our Messengers? Then, they will know
When yokes are on their necks and the chains, they will be dragged
into scalding water. Again, they will be poured forth into the fire as fuel
Again, it will be said to them: Where are what you had been ascribing as partners
other than God? They would say: They went astray from us. Nay! We be not calling to anything before. Thus, God causes to go astray ones who are ungrateful
That was because you had been exultant on the earth without right and that you had been glad
Enter the doors of hell as ones who will dwell in it forever. Then, miserable it will be as a place of lodging for the ones who increase in pride
So have thou patience. Truly, the promise of God is true. And whether We cause thee to see some part of what We promise them or We call thee to Us, then, it is to Us they will be returned
And, certainly, We sent Messengers before thee among whom We related to thee and of whom We relate not to thee. And it had not been for any Messenger that he bring a sign, except with the permission of God. So when the command of God drew near, the matter would be decided rightfully. And lost here are these, the ones who deal in falsehood
God is He Who has made for you flocks among which you may ride on them and among which you eat of them
And you have what profits from them and that with them you reach the satisfaction of a need that is in your breasts and you are carried on them and on boats
And He causes you to see His signs. So which of the signs of God do you reject
Journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those before them? They had been more than them and were more vigorous in strength and in regard to the traces they left on the earth. Then, availed them not what they had been earning
Then, when their Messengers drew near them with the clear portents, they were glad in the knowledge that they had and surrounded them was what they had been ridiculing
So when they saw Our might, they said: We believed in God alone and we were ungrateful in that we had been ones who are polytheists
But their belief be not what profits them once they saw Our might. This is a custom of God which was, surely, in force among His servants. And lost here are the ones who are ungrateful
M\m
A sending down successively from The Merciful, The Compassionate
a Book in which its signs we37:181re explained distinctly, an Arabic Recitation for a folk who know
a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, but most of them turned aside so they hear not
And they said: Our hearts are sheathed from that to which thou hast called us and in our ears is a heaviness and between us and between thee is a partition. So work. Truly, we, too, are ones who work
Say: I am only a mortal like you. It is revealed to me that your God is God, One; so go straight to Him and ask for forgiveness from Him, and woe to the ones who are polytheists—those who give not the purifying alms
and who in the world to come are ones who disbelieve
Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them will be compensation, that which is unfailing
Say: Truly, are you ungrateful to Him Who created the earth in two days? And assign you to Him rivals? That is the Lord of the worlds
And He made on it firm mountains from above it and He blessed it and ordained its subsistence within it in four days equally for the ones who ask
Again, He turned His attention to the heaven while it was smoke and He said to it and to the earth: Approach both of you willing or unwilling. They both said: We approached as ones who are obedient
Then, foreordaining seven heavens in two days, He revealed in each heaven its command. We made the present heaven appear pleasing with lamps and keeping them safe. Thus, decreed the Almighty, The Knowing
But if they turned aside, then, say: I warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of Ad and Thamud
And when the Messengers drew near before them and from behind them saying: Worship none but God, they said: If our Lord willed, He would have caused angels to descend. Then, truly, in what you were sent, we are ones who disbelieve
As for Ad, they grew arrogant on the earth without right and they said: Who is more vigorous than us in strength? Consider they not that God Who created them, He was more vigorous than they in strength? And they had been negating Our signs
So We sent on them a raging wind in days of misfortune that We might cause them to experience the punishment of degradation in this present life. And the punishment in the world to come will be more degrading; and they will not be helped
And as for Thamud, We guided them, but they embraced blindness of heart instead of guidance. Then, a thunderbolt took them with a humiliating punishment because of what they had been earning
We delivered those who believed and had been Godfearing
On a Day when will be assembled the enemies of God to the fire, then, they will be marching in rank
until when they drew near it. Witness will be borne against them by their having the ability to hear, and by their sight and by their skins as to what they had been doing
And they will say to their skins: Why bore you witness against us? They will say: We were given speech by God Who gave speech to all things. And He created you the first time and to Him you will be returned
And you had not been covering yourselves so that witness be borne against you by your having the ability to hear or by your sight or by your skins but that you thought that God knows not much of what you do
And that your thought, which you thought about your Lord has dealt destruction to you. Then, you became among the ones who are losers
Then, even if they endure patiently, yet the fire will be the place of lodging for them. And if they ask for favor, yet they will not be of the ones to whom favor is shown
And We allotted for them comrades who were made to appear pleasing to them whatever was before them and whatever was behind them. And the saying was realized against them in communities that passed away before them of jinn and humankind. Truly, they, they had been ones who are losers
And those who are ungrateful said: Hear not this, the Quran, but talk idly about it while it is being recited so that perhaps you will prevail
We will cause those who were ungrateful to experience a severe punishment. And We will give recompense to them for the bad deeds of what they had been doing
That is the recompense of the enemies of God: The fire. For them is the infinite abode in it, recompense because they had been negating Our signs
And those who were ungrateful would say: Our Lord! Cause us to see those who caused us to go astray among jinn and humankind. We will lay them both beneath our feet so that they become of the lowest
Truly, those who said: Our Lord is God, again, they went straight, the angels come forth to them: Neither fear nor feel remorse, but rejoice in the Gardens which you had been promised
We were protectors in this present life and in the world to come. And you will have in it that for which your souls lust and in it is what you call for
a hospitality from the Forgiving, Compassionate
And who has a fairer saying than he who called to God and did as one in accord with morality, and said: I am one of the ones who submit to God
Not on the same level are benevolence or the evil deed. Drive back with what is fairer. Then, behold he who between thee and between him was enmity as if he had been a protector, a loyal friend
And none will be in receipt of it but those who endured patiently. And none will be in receipt of it but the possessor of a sublime allotment
But if Satan sows enmity, sowing enmity in thee, then, seek refuge in God. Truly, He is The Hearing, The Knowing
And of His signs are the nighttime and the daytime and the sun and the moon. Prostrate not yourselves to the sun nor to the moon, but prostrate yourselves to God Who created both of them if it is He you had been worshiping
But if they grew arrogant, then, those who are with thy Lord glorify Him during the nighttime and the daytime and they never grow weary.‡
And among His signs are that thou hast seen the earth as that which is humble. But when We caused water to descend to it, it quivered and swelled. Truly, He Who gives life to it is the One Who Gives Life to the dead. Truly, He is Powerful over everything
Truly, those who blaspheme Our signs are not hidden from Us. Is he who is cast down into the fire better off, or he who approaches as one who is safe on the Day of Resurrection? Do as you willed. Truly, He is Seeing of what you do
Truly, those who were ungrateful for the Remembrance when it drew near them are not hidden from Us. And, truly, it is a mighty Book
Falsehood approaches it not from before it, nor from behind it. It is a sending down successively from The Wise, The Worthy of Praise
Nothing is said to thee but what, truly, was said to the Messengers before thee. Truly, thy Lord is, certainly, the Possessor of Forgiveness, and the Possessor of Painful Repayment
And if We made this a non-Arabic Recitation, they would have said: Why were His signs not explained distinctly: A non-Arab tongue and an Arab! Say: It is a guidance for those who believe and a healing. And as for those who believed not, there is a heaviness in their ears and blindness in their hearts. Those are given notice from a far place
And, certainly, We gave Moses the Book. Then, they were at variance about it. And if it were not for a Word that had preceded from thy Lord, it would have been decided between them. But, truly, they are in uncertainty, ones in grave doubt about it
Whoever did as one in accord with morality, it is for himself. And whoever did evil, it is against himself, and thy Lord is not unjust to His servants
To Him is returned the knowledge of the Hour. No fruits go forth from its sheath and no female conceives or brings forth offspring but with His knowledge. And on a Day He will cry out to them: Where are My ascribed associates? They would say: We proclaimed to Thee that none of us was a witness to that
Gone astray from them is what they had been calling to before. They would think that there is for them no asylum
The human being grows not weary of supplicating for good, but if the worst afflicted him, then, he is hopeless, desperate
And, truly, if We caused him to experience mercy from Us, after some tribulation afflicted him, he will, certainly, say: This is due to me. And I think not that the Hour will be one that arises, but if I were returned to my Lord, truly, with Him will be the fairer for me. Then, certainly, We will tell those who were ungrateful of what they did. And We will cause them to experience a harsh punishment
And when We were gracious to the human being, he turned aside, withdrew aside. But when the worst afflicted him, then, he is full of supplication
Say: Considered you that even though it had been from God, again, you were ungrateful for it. Who is one who goes more astray than he who is in wide breach
We will cause them to see Our signs on the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is The Truth. Suffices not thy Lord that, truly, He is Witness over all things
They are hesitant about the meeting with their Lord. Truly, He is who One Who Encloses everything
M\m
Ayn S Q[f]
Thus, He reveals to thee and to those who were before thee, God is The Almighty, The Wise
To Him belongs whatever is in and on the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. And He is The Lofty, The Sublime
The heavens are about to split asunder from above them while the angels glorify the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for whoever is on the earth. Truly, God, He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate
As for those who took to themselves other than Him as protectors, God is Guardian over them and thou art not a Trustee over them
And, thus, We revealed to thee an Arabic Recitation that thou wilt warn the Mother of the Towns and whoever is around it. And warn of the Day of Amassing. There is no doubt about it. A group of people will be in the Garden and a group of people will be in the blaze
And if God willed, He would have made them one community but He causes to enter whom He wills into His mercy. And the ones who are unjust, there is not for them either a protector or a helper
Or they took other than Him to themselves as protectors. But God, He alone is The Protector. And He gives life to the dead. And He is Powerful over everything
Whatever thing about which you were at variance in it, then, its determination is with God. That is God, my Lord in Whom I put my trust and to Him I am penitent
One Who is Originator of the heavens and the earth. He made for you spouses of yourselves and of the flocks, pairs by which means He makes you numerous in it. There is not like Him anything. And He is The Hearing, The Seeing
To Him belongs the pass keys of the heavens and the earth. He extends provision for whomever He wills and measures it. Truly, He is The Knowing of everything
He laid down the law of the way of life for you, that with which He charged Noah and what We revealed to thee and that with which We charged Abraham and Moses and Jesus. Perform the prescribed way of life and be not split up in it. Troublesome for the ones who are polytheists is that to which thou hast called them. God elects for Himself whomever He wills and guides the penitent to Himself
And they split not up until after the knowledge drew near them through insolence between themselves. And if it were not for a Word that preceded from thy Lord—until a term, that which is determined—it would be decided between them. And, truly, those who were given as inheritance the Book after them are in uncertainty, in grave doubt about it
Then, for that, call to this. And go thou straight as thou wert commanded. And follow not their desires. And say: I believed in what God caused to descend from a Book. And I was commanded to be just among you. God is our Lord and your Lord. For us are our actions and for you, your actions. There is no disputation between us and between you. God will gather us together. And to Him is the Homecoming
And those who argue with one another about God, after He was assented to, their disputations are null and void with their Lord, and on them is His anger. And for them will be a severe punishment
It is God Who caused the Book to descend with The Truth and the Balance. And what causes thee to recognize it so that perhaps the Hour is near
Seeking to hasten are those who believe not in it. Those who believed are ones who are apprehensive of it. And they know that it is The Truth, those who altercate, truly, about the Hour are, certainly, going far astray
God is Subtle with His servants. He provides to whom He wills. And He is The Strong, The Almighty
Whoever had been wanting cultivation of the world to come, We increase his cultivation for him. Whoever had been wanting cultivation of the present, We give him of it. And he has not a share in the world to come
Or ascribe they associates who laid down the law of the way of life for them for which God gives not permission? Were it not for a decisive word, it would be decided among them. And, truly, the ones who are unjust, for them is a painful punishment
Thou wilt see the ones who are unjust as ones who are apprehensive of what they earned and it is that which falls on them. And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, are in the well-watered meadows of the Gardens. For them will be whatever they will from their Lord. That it is the great grace
That is what God gives as good tidings to His servants who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality. Say: I ask you not for compensation, but for the affection for any kin. And whoever gains benevolence, We will increase for him goodness in it. Truly, God is Forgiving, Most Ready to Appreciate
Or they say: He devised against God a lie. But if God wills He would have sealed over thy heart. And God blots out falsehood and verifies The Truth by His Words. Truly, He is Knowing of what is in the breasts
And He accepts the remorse of His servants and pardons their evil deeds. And He knows what you accomplish
And He responds to those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, and increases them of His grace. And as for the ones who are ungrateful, theirs will be a severe punishment
And if God extended the provision for His servants, they would be insolent in the earth, but He sends down by measure whatever He wills. Truly, He is The Aware, The Seeing of His servants
And He it is Who sends down plenteous rain water after they despaired and He unfolds His mercy. And He is The Protector, The Worthy of Praise
And among His signs are the creation of the heavens and the earth and whatever of moving creatures He disseminated in them. And He has the power of amassing them when He wills
And whatever affliction lit on you is because of what your hands earned. And He pardons much
And you are not ones who frustrate Him on the earth. And there is not for you other than God either a protector or a helper
And among His signs are the ones that run on the sea like landmarks
If He wills, He stills the wind. Then, they would stay, that which is motionless on the surface. Truly, in that are signs for every enduring and grateful one
Or He wreck them because of what they earned. And He pardons them from much
And those who dispute Our signs know that there is no asylum for them
So whatever thing you were given is the enjoyment of this present life. And what is with God is better and is that which endures for those who believed and put their trust in their Lord
and those who avoid the major sins and the indecencies and they forgive when they were angry
and those who responded to their Lord and performed their formal prayer and their affairs are by counsel among themselves, and who spend of what We provided them
and those who, when insolence lit on them, they help each other
And the recompense for an evil deed is the like of an evil deed. Then, whoever pardoned and made things right, his compensation is due from God. Truly, He loves not the ones who are unjust
As whoever helped himself after an injustice, so those, there is not any way against them
The way is only against those who do wrong to humanity and are insolent in and on the earth unrightfully. Those, for them is a painful punishment
And whoever endured patiently and forgave, truly, that is, certainly, a sign of constancy of affairs
And whomever God causes to go astray has no protector apart from Him. And thou wilt see the ones who are unjust when they would see the punishment. They will say: Is there any way of turning it back
And thou wilt see them being presented to it as ones who are humbled by a sense of humility looking on with secretive glances. And those who believed will say: Truly, the ones who are losers are those who lost themselves and their people on the Day of Resurrection. Truly, the ones who are unjust will be in an abiding punishment
that there had not been for them any protector to help them other than God. And he whom God causes to go astray, there is not for him any way
Respond to the call of your Lord before a Day approaches for which there is no turning back from God. There will be no shelter for you on that Day, nor is there for you any refusal
But if they turned aside, We put thee not forward as a guardian over them. It is for thee not but the delivering of the message. And, truly, when We caused the human being to experience mercy from Us, he was glad in it. But when evil deeds light on him—because of what his hands sent—then, truly, the human being is ungrateful
To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows females on whom He wills. And He bestows males on whom He wills
And He couples them, males and females. And He makes barren whom He wills. Truly, He is Knowing, Powerful
And it had not been for a mortal that God speak to him, but by revelation or from behind a partition or that He send a Messenger to reveal by His permission what He wills. Truly, He is Lofty, Wise
And, thus, We revealed to thee the Spirit of Our command. Thou hadst not been informed what the Book is nor what is belief, but We made it a light by which We guide whomever We will of Our servants. And, truly, thou, thou hast guided to a straight path—
the path of God, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. Truly, will not all affairs come home to God
M\m
By the clear Book
We, truly, made it an Arabic Recitation so that perhaps you will be reasonable
Truly, it is in the essence of the Book from Our Presence, Lofty, Wise
Will We turn away the Remembrance from you, overlooking as you had been a folk, ones who are excessive
And how many a Prophet sent We among the ancient ones
And approaches them not a Prophet, but that they had been ridiculing him
Then, We caused to perish the more vigorous in courage than them and the example of the ancient ones passed
And, certainly, if thou hadst asked them: Who created the heavens and the earth? They will, certainly, say: The Almighty, The Knowing created them
Who made the earth a cradle for you and made in it ways for you so that perhaps you would be truly guided
and Who sent down water from heaven in measure. Then, We revived with it a lifeless land. Thus, you are brought out
And it is He Who created all the pairs and assigned for you the boats and the flocks on which you ride
so that you sit upon their backs. And, again, remember the divine blessing of your Lord when you are seated on them and you say: Glory be to Him Who caused this to be subservient to us and we had not been ones who are equal to it
And, truly, we, certainly, are to our Lord ones who are turning
Yet they assigned with Him a part of some of His servants. Truly, the human being is clearly ungrateful
Or took He to Himself daughters from what He creates and selected He sons for you
And if good tidings were given to one of them of what he cited as an example from The Merciful, his face stayed one that is clouded over and he chokes
Is whoever is brought up amid glitter one who is without clarity when he is in an altercation
And made they the angels—who themselves are servants of The Merciful— females? Bore they witness to their creation? Their giving testimony will be written down. And they will be asked about it
And they would say: If willed The Merciful, we would not have worshiped them. And they have no knowledge of that. They do nothing but guess
Or gave We them any Book before this so they are ones who hold fast to it
Nay! They said: We found our fathers in a community holding to a way of life and we are, truly, in their footsteps ones who are truly guided
And, thus, We sent not a warner to any town before thee without ones who are given ease saying: We found our fathers in a community. We are, certainly, ones who imitate their footsteps
He said: Even if I brought about better guidance for you than what you found your fathers on. They would say: Truly, we, in that with which you were sent are ones who disbelieve
So We requited them. Then, look on how had been the Ultimate End of the ones who deny
Mention when Abraham said to his father and his folk: Truly, I am released from obligation to what you worship
other than He Who originated me and, truly, He will guide me
And He made it an enduring Word among his posterity, so that perhaps they will return
Nay! I gave enjoyment to these and to their fathers until The Truth drew near them and a clear Messenger
And when The Truth drew near them, they said: This is sorcery and we are ones who disbelieve in it
They said: Why was this, the Quran, not sent down to some eminent man of the two towns
Would they divide the mercy of thy Lord? It is We Who divided out among them their livelihood in this present life. Exalted are some of them above some others in degree so that some take to themselves others in their bondage. And the mercy of thy Lord is better than what they gather
And were it not that humanity be one community, would We have made for whoever is ungrateful for The Merciful, roofs of silver for their houses, and stairways which they would scale up
and for their houses, doors, and couches on which they would recline
and ornaments? Yet all this would have been nothing, but enjoyment of this present life. And the world to come with your Lord is for the ones who are Godfearing
And whoever withdraws from the Remembrance of The Merciful, We allotted for him a satan, so he is a comrade for him
And, truly, they bar them from the way, but they assume that they are ones who are truly guided
Then, when he drew near us he would say: Would that there were a distance between me and between thee of two sunrises! Miserable was the comrade
And it will never profit you this Day as you did wrong. You will be ones who are partners in the punishment
So hast thou caused someone unwilling to hear, to hear or wilt thou guide the unwilling to see, or someone who had been clearly going astray
And even if We take thee away, We will, truly, be ones who requite them
or We will cause thee to see what We promised them. Then, We are ones who are omnipotent over them
So hold thee fast to what was revealed to thee. Truly, thou art on a straight path
And, truly, this is a remembrance for thee and thy folk. And you will be asked
And ask ones whom We sent before thee of Our Messengers: Made We gods other than the Merciful to be worshiped
And, certainly, We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his Council. So he said: Truly, I am a Messenger of the Lord of the worlds
But when he drew near them with Our signs, that is when they laugh at them
And We cause them not to see any sign, but it was greater than its sister’s sign. And We took them with the punishment so that perhaps they would return
And they said: O one who is a sorcerer! Call for us to thy Lord by the compact He made with thee. Truly, We will be ones who are truly guided
But when We removed the punishment from them, that is when they break their oath
And Pharaoh proclaimed to his folk. He said: O my folk! Is not the dominion of Egypt for me and these rivers run beneath me? Will you not, then, perceive
Or am I better than this one who is despicable, who scarcely makes things clear
Why were bracelets of gold not cast down on him or the angels drawn near to him as ones who are connected with one another
Thus, he irritated his folk. Then, they obeyed him. Truly, they had been a folk, ones who disobey
So when they provoked against Us, We requited them and drowned them one and all
and We made them a thing of the past and a parable for later ages
And when the son of Mary was cited as an example, that is when thy folk cry aloud
and said: Are our gods better or is he? They cited him to thee not but to be argumentative. Nay! They are a contentious folk
He was but a servant to whom We were gracious, and We made him an example to the Children of Israel
And if We will, We would have assigned angels to succeed among you on the earth
And, truly, he is with the knowledge of the Hour, so contest not about it and follow Me. This is a straight path
And let not Satan bar you. Truly, he is a clear enemy to you
And when Jesus drew near with the clear portents, he said: Truly, I drew near you with wisdom and in order to make manifest to you some of that about which you are at variance in it. So be Godfearing of God and obey me
Truly, God He is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him. This is a straight path
The confederates were at variance among themselves. So woe to those who did wrong from the punishment of a painful Day
Looked they on but for the Hour that will approach them suddenly while they are not aware
Friends on that Day will be enemies some to some others, but ones who are Godfearing
O My servants! This Day there shall be no fear in you nor will you feel remorse
It will be said to those who believed in Our signs and had been ones who submit to God
Enter the Garden, you and your spouses, to be walking with joy
There will be passed around among them platters of gold and goblets. And in it will be whatever souls lust for and all that in which the eyes delight. And you will be ones who dwell in it forever
This is the Garden that you were given as inheritance because of what you had been doing
For you there will be much sweet fruit from which you will eat
Truly, ones who sin will be in the punishment of hell, ones who will dwell in it forever
It will not be decreased for them and they will be ones who are seized with despair in it
And We did not wrong them, but they had been ones who are unjust
And they would cry out: O Malik! Let thy Lord finish us. He would say: Truly, you will be ones who abide
Certainly, We brought about The Truth to you, but most of you are ones who dislike The Truth
Or fixed they on some affair? Then, We, too, are ones who fix some affair
Assume they that We hear not their secret thoughts and their conspiring secretly? Yea! Our messengers are near them writing down
Say: If The Merciful had had a son, then, I would be first of the ones who worship
Glory be to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, from all that they allege
So let them engage in idle talk and play until they encounter their Day which they are promised
And it is He Who is in the heaven, God, and on the earth, God. And He is The Wise, The Knowing
Blessed be He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and with Whom is the knowledge of the Hour and to Whom you will be returned
And those whom they call to possess no power other than Him for intercession, only whoever bore witness to The Truth, and they know
And if thou hadst asked them: Who created them? They would, certainly, say: God. Then, how are they misled
And his saying: O my Lord! Truly, these are a folk who believe not
so overlook them and say: Peace. And they will know
M\m
By the clear Book
truly, We caused it to descend on a blessed night. Truly, We had been ones who warn
Every wise command is made clear in it
a command from Us. Truly, We had been ones who send it
as a mercy from thy Lord. Truly, He is The Hearing, The Knowing
Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. If you had been ones who are certain
There is no god but He. It is He Who gives life and causes to die. He is your Lord and the Lord of your ancient fathers
Nay! They play in uncertainty
Then, thou be on the watch for a Day when the heavens will bring a clear smoke
overcoming humanity. This is a painful punishment
Our Lord! Remove thou the punishment from us! Truly, we are ones who believe
What will there be as a reminder for them? A clear Messenger drew near them
Again, they turned away from him and they said: He is one who is taught by others, one who is possessed
Truly, We are ones who remove the punishment for a little. Truly, you are ones who revert to ingratitude
On the Day when We will seize by force with the greatest attack, truly, We will be ones who requite
And, certainly, We tried a folk of Pharaoh before them when there drew near them a generous Messenger
Give back to me the servants of God, the Children of Israel. Truly, I am a trustworthy Messenger to you
And rise not up against God. Truly, I am one who arrives with a clear authority
Truly, I took refuge in my Lord and your Lord so that you not stone me
But if you believe not in me, then, withdraw
So he called on his Lord: Truly, these are a folk, ones who sin
He said: Set thou forth with my servants by night. Truly, you will be ones who are followed
And leave the sea calmly as it is. Truly, they will be an army, one that is drowned
How many they left behind of gardens and springs
and crops and generous stations
and prosperity in which they had been, ones who are joyful
And, thus, We gave it as inheritance to another folk
And neither the heavens wept for them nor the earth nor had they been ones who are given respite
And, certainly, We delivered the Children of Israel from the despised punishment
of Pharaoh. Truly, He had been one who exalts himself and was of the ones who are excessive
And, certainly, We chose them with knowledge above the worlds
and gave them the signs in which there was a clear trial
Truly, these say
There is nothing but our first singled out death and we will not be ones who are revived
Then, bring our fathers back if you had been ones who are sincere
Are they better or a folk of Tubba and those who were before them? We caused them to perish. They, truly, had been ones who sin
And We created not the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them as ones who play
We created them not but with The Truth but most of them know not
Truly, the Day of Decision is the time appointed for them one and all
a Day when a defender will not avail another defender at all nor will they be helped
but him on whom God had mercy. Truly, He is The Almighty, The Compassionate
Truly, the tree of Zaqqum
will be the food of the sinful
Like molten copper it will bubble in the bellies
like boiling, scalding water
It will be said: Take him and drag him violently into the depths of hellfire
Again, then, unloose over his head the punishment of scalding water
Experience this! Truly, thou, thou art seemingly the mighty, the generous
Truly, this is what you had been contesting
Truly, the ones who are Godfearing will be in the station of trustworthiness
among Gardens and springs
wearing fine silk and brocade, ones who face one another
Thus, it is so. We will give in marriage lovely, most beautiful eyed ones
They will call therein for every kind of sweet fruit, ones that are safe
They will not experience death with them but the first singled out death. And He will protect them from the punishment of hellfire
a grace from thy Lord. That, it is the winning the sublime triumph
Truly, We made this easy in thy language so that perhaps they will recollect
So be on the watch! Truly, they are ones who watch
M\m
The sending down the Book successively is from God, The Almighty, The Wise
Truly, in the heavens and the earth are signs for the ones who believe
And in your creation and what He disseminates of moving creatures are signs for a folk who are certain
the alternation of the nighttime and the daytime and what God caused to descend from the heaven of provision. He gave life with it to the earth after its death and the diversifying of the winds—signs for a folk who are reasonable
These are the signs of God We recount to thee with The Truth. Then, in which discourse, after God and His signs, will they believe
Woe to every false, sinful one
He hears the signs of God being recounted to him. Again, he persists as one who grows arrogant as if he hears them not. So give him good tidings of a painful punishment
And if he knew anything about Our signs, he took them to himself in mockery. Those, for them is a despised punishment
Behind them there is hell. What they earned will avail them not at all nor whatever they took to themselves other than God as protectors. And for them will be a tremendous punishment
This is a guidance. Those who were ungrateful for the signs of their Lord, for them there is a punishment of painful wrath
God! It is He Who caused the sea to be subservient to you that the boats may run through it by His command and so that you be looking for His grace and so that perhaps you will give thanks
And He caused to be subservient to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. All is from Him. Truly, in that are signs for a folk who reflect
Say to those who believed: Forgive those who hope not for the Days of God that He give recompense to a folk according to what they had been earning
Whoever did as one in accord with morality, it is for himself and whoever did evil, it is against himself. Again, to your Lord you will be returned
And, certainly, We gave the Children of Israel the Book, the critical judgment and the prophethood and We provided them from what is good and We gave them advantage over the worlds
and We gave them clear portents of the command. And they are not at variance until after the knowledge drew near them through insolence among themselves. Truly, thy Lord will decree between them on the Day of Resurrection about what they had been at variance in it
Again, We assigned thee an open way of the command so follow it and follow not the desires of those who know not
Truly, they will never avail thee against God at all. And, truly, the ones who are unjust, some of them are protectors of some others. But God is Protector of the ones who are Godfearing
This is a clear evidence for humanity and a guidance and a mercy for a folk who are certain
Assumed those who sought to do evil deeds that We will make them equal with those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality? Are their living and dying equal? How evil is the judgment they give
And God created the heavens and the earth with The Truth so that every soul would be given recompense for what it earned and they, they will not be wronged
Hadst thou considered he who took to himself his own desire as his god and whom God caused to go astray out of a knowledge, sealed over his having the ability to hear and his heart and laid a blindfold on his sight? Who, then, will guide him after God? Will you not, then, recollect
And they said: There is nothing, but this present life of ours. We die and we live and nothing causes us to perish but a long course of time. And there is for them not any knowledge. Truly, they are but surmising
And when are recounted to them Our signs, clear portents, then, disputation had not been but that they said: Bring our fathers if you had been ones who are sincere
Say: God gives you life. Again, He causes you to die. Again, He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection in which there is no doubt but most of humanity knows not
And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And on a Day that the Hour will be secure, on that Day the ones who deal in falsehood will lose
Thou wilt see each community one who crawls on its knees. Each community will be called to its book: This Day you will be given recompense for what you had been doing
This is Our Book that speaks for itself against you with The Truth. Truly, We registered what you had been doing
Then, as for those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, their Lord will cause them to enter in His mercy. That will be the winning the clear triumph
But as for those who were ungrateful: Be not My signs recounted to you? Then, you grew arrogant and you had been a folk, ones who sin
And when it was said: Truly, the promise of God is true and the Hour, there is no doubt about it. You said: We are not informed about the Hour. Truly, We think it but an opinion and we are not ones who ascertain it
And shown to themselves will be the evil deeds they did. They will be surrounded by what they had been ridiculing
It would be said: This Day We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this your Day. Your place of shelter will be the fire and there is not for you any one who helps
This is because you took to yourselves the signs of God in mockery and this present life deluded you. So this Day they will not be brought out from there nor will they ask to be favored
So The Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, and the Lord of the worlds
And His is the domination of the heavens and the earth. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
M\m
The sending down successively of the Book is from God The Almighty, The Wise
We created not the heavens and the earth and whatever is between the two, but with The Truth and for a term, that which is determined. And those who disbelieved in what they were warned about are ones who turn aside
Say: Considered you what you call to other than God? Cause me to see what of the earth they created. Have they an association in the heavens? Bring me a Book from before this, or a vestige of knowledge if you had been ones who are sincere
And who is one who has gone more astray than one who calls to other than God, one who responds not to him until the Day of Resurrection? And they are of their supplication to them, ones who are heedless
And when humanity will be assembled, they will become their enemies and will be ones who disavow their worship
And when Our signs are recounted, clear portents, those who were ungrateful for The Truth said when it drew near them: This is clear sorcery
Or they say: He devised it. Say: If I devised it, you still possess nothing for me against God. He is greater in knowledge of what you press on about. He sufficed as a Witness between me and between you. And He is The Forgiving, The Compassionate
Say: I had not been an innovation among the Messengers, nor am I informed of what will be wreaked on me, nor with you. I follow only what is revealed to me and I am only a clear warner
Say: Considered you if this had been from God and you were ungrateful for it and bore witness as one who bears witness from among the Children of Israel to its like and believed in it, yet you grew arrogant, how unjust you are; truly, God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust
Those who were ungrateful said of those who believed: If it had been good, they would not have preceded us towards it. And when they are not truly guided by it, they say: This is a ripe, aged calumny
Yet before it was the Book of Moses for a leader and as a mercy. And this is a Book, that which establishes as true in the Arabic language to warn those who did wrong and as good tidings to the ones who are doers of good
Truly, those who say: Our Lord is God again, go straight, neither will there be fear in them, nor will they feel remorse
Those are the Companions of the Garden, ones who will dwell in it forever as a recompense for what they had been doing
And We charged the human being with kindness to ones who are his parents. His mother carried him painfully and she painfully brought him forth. And the bearing of him and the weaning of him are thirty months. When he was fully grown, having come of age and reached forty years he said: My Lord! Arouse me that I may give thanks for Thy divine blessing, that with which Thou wert gracious to me and to ones who are my parents and that I do as one in accord with morality so that Thou be well-pleased and make things right for me and my offspring. Truly, I repented to Thee and, truly, I am of the ones who submit to God
Those are those from whom We will receive the fairer of what they did and we will pass on by their evil deeds. They are among the Companions of the Garden. This is the promise of sincerity that they had been promised
But he who would say to ones who are his parents a word of disrespect to both of them: Promise you me that I will be brought out when generations before me passed away? And they will both cry to God for help: Woe unto thee! Believe! Truly, the promise of God is true. But he said: This is only the fables of the ancient ones
Those are those against whom the saying was realized about the communities that passed away before of the jinn and humankind. Truly, they had been ones who are losers
And for each there will be degrees according to what he did and He will pay them their account in full for their actions and they, they will not be wronged
On a Day when they will be presented—those who were ungrateful—to the fire, it will be said: You caused what is good to be put away in your present life while you enjoyed it. Then, you will be given recompense with a punishment of humiliation because you had been growing arrogant on the earth without right and because you had been disobeying
And remember the brother of Ad when he warned his folk in the curving sandhills. Warnings passed away before and after him saying: Worship nothing but God. Truly, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day
They said: Hadst thou drawn near to us to mislead us from our gods? Then, bring us that which thou hast promised us if thou hadst been among the ones who are sincere
He said: The knowledge is only with God and I state to you what I was sent with, but I see that you are a folk who are ignorant
Then, when they saw it as a dense cloud proceeding towards their valleys, they said: This is a dense cloud, that which gives rain to us. Nay! It is what you seek to hasten, a wind in which there is a painful punishment
It will destroy everything at the command of its Lord. So it came to be in the morning nothing was seen but their dwellings. Thus, We give recompense to the folk, ones who sin
And, certainly, We established them firmly in what We established you firmly not and We made for them the ability to hear and sight and minds. Yet having the ability to hear availed them not, nor their sight, nor their minds at all since they had been negating the signs of God. And surrounded were they by what they had been ridiculing
And, certainly, We caused to perish towns around you and We diversified the signs so that perhaps they will return
Then, why helped them not those whom they took to themselves other than God as gods as a mediator. Nay! They went astray from them. And that was their calumny and what they had been devising
And when We turned away from thee groups of men or jinn who listen to the Quran, when they found themselves in its presence, they said: Pay heed. And when it was finished, they turned to their folk, ones who warn
They said: O our folk! Truly, We heard a Book was caused to descend after Moses, that which establishes as true what was in advance of it. It guides to The Truth and to a straight road
O our folk! Answer one who calls to God and believe in Him. He will forgive you your impieties and will grant protection to you from a painful punishment
And who answers not to one who calls to God? He is not one who frustrates Him in and on the earth. And there will not be for him other than God any protectors. Those are clearly gone astray
Considered they not that God Who created the heavens and the earth and is not wearied by their creation—is One Who Has Power to give life to the dead? Yea! He, truly, is Powerful over everything
And on a Day when will be presented those who were ungrateful to the fire saying: Is not this The Truth? They would say: Yea! By our Lord! He will say: Then, experience the punishment because you had been ungrateful
So have thou patience as endured patiently those imbued with constancy of the Messengers and let them not seek to hasten the Judgment. As, truly, on a Day they will see what they are promised as if they lingered not in expectation but for an hour of daytime. This is delivering the message! Will any be caused to perish but the folk, the ones who disobey
Those who were ungrateful and who barred from the way of God—He caused their actions to go astray
And those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality and believed in what was sent down to Muhammad—for it is The Truth from their Lord—He will absolve them of their evil deeds and will make right their state of mind
That is because those who were ungrateful followed falsehood, while those who believed followed The Truth from their Lord. Thus, God propounds for humanity their parables
So when you met those who were ungrateful, then, strike their thick necks until you gave them a sound thrashing. Then, tie them fast with restraints. And afterwards either have good will towards them or take ransom for them until the war ends, laying down its heavy load. Thus, it is so! But if God willed, He Himself would have, certainly, avenged you. But it is to try some of you with some others. As for those who were slain in the way of God, He will never cause their actions to go astray
He will guide them and He will make right their state of mind
And He will cause them to enter the Garden with which He acquainted them
O those who believed! If you help God, He will help you and make firm your feet
As for those who are ungrateful, for them is falling into ruin! And He caused their actions to go astray
That is because they disliked what God caused to descend so He caused their actions to fail
Journey they not through the earth and look on how had been the Ultimate End of those who were before them? God destroyed them. And for ones who are ungrateful is its likeness
That is because God is the Defender of those who believed. And for the ones who are ungrateful, there is no defender of them
Truly, God will cause to enter those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, gardens beneath which rivers run. While those who were ungrateful, take joy in eating as the flocks eat, the fire will be the place of lodging for them
And how many a town had there been which was stronger in strength than thy town which drove thee out, that We have caused to perish? And there was no one who helps them
Is he who had been on a clear portent from his Lord like him for whom was made to appear pleasing his dire actions and they followed their own desires
This is the parable of the Garden which was promised the ones who are Godfearing: In it are rivers of unpolluted water and rivers of milk, the taste of which is not modified and rivers of intoxicants delightful to ones who drink and rivers of clarified honey, and in it for them all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. Is this like ones who will dwell forever in the fire and they were given scalding water to drink so that it cuts off their bowels
And among them are some who listen to thee until when they went forth from thee. They said to those who were given the knowledge: What was that he said just now? Those are those upon whose hearts God set a seal. And they followed their own desires
And those who were truly guided, He increased them in guidance and He gave to them their God-consciousness
Look they, then, on not but the Hour, that it approach them suddenly? Certainly, its tokens drew near. Then, what will it be like for them when their reminder drew near to them
So know thou that there is no god but God and ask forgiveness for thy impieties and also for the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe, and God knows your place of turmoil and your place of lodging
And those who believed say: Why was a Chapter of the Quran not caused to descend? But when was caused to descend a definitive Chapter of the Quran and fighting was remembered in it, thou hadst seen those who in their hearts is a sickness looking on thee with the look of one who is fainting at death
But better for them would be obedience and an honorable saying! And when the affair was resolved, then, if they were sincere to God, it would have been better for them
Will it be that if you turned away, you would make corruption in the earth and cut off your ties with blood relations
Those are those whom God cursed, so He made them unwilling to hear and their sight, unwilling to see
Meditate they not, then, on the Quran or are there locks on their hearts
Truly, those who went back—turn their back— after the guidance became clear to them, it was Satan who enticed them and He granted them indulgence
That is because they said to those who disliked what God sent down: We will obey you in some of the affair. And God knows what they keep secret
Then, how will it be for them when the angels will call them to themselves, striking their faces and their backs
That is because they followed what displeased God and they disliked His contentment so He caused their actions to fail
Or assumed those who in their hearts is a sickness that God will never bring out their rancor
If We will, We would have caused thee to see them. Thou wouldst have recognized them by their mark. But, certainly, thou wilt recognize them by the twisting of sayings. And God knows all your actions
And, certainly, We will try you until We know the ones who struggle among you and the ones who remain steadfast and We will try your reports
Truly, those who were ungrateful and barred from the way of God and made a breach with the Messenger after guidance became clear to them, they never hurt or profit God at all, but He will cause their actions to fail
O those who believed! Obey God and obey the Messenger and render not your actions untrue
Truly, those who were ungrateful and barred from the way of God, again, they died while they were ones who are ungrateful, then, God will never forgive them
So be not faint and call for peace while you have the upper hand. God is with you and He will never cheat you out of your actions
This present life is only a pastime and a diversion. But if you believe and are Godfearing, He will give you your compensation and will not ask of you for your property
When He asks it of you and, then, urges persistently, you would be a miser and He will bring out your rancor
Lo and behold! These are being called to spend in the way of God, yet among you are some who are misers. And whoever is a miser, then, he is a miser only to himself. God is Sufficient and you are poor. And if you turn away, He will have a folk other than you in exchange. Again, they will not be the like of you
Truly, We gave victory to thee, a clear victory
that God forgive thee what was former of thy impiety and what remained behind that He fulfill His divine blessing on thee and guide thee on a straight path
and that God help thee with a mighty help
He it is Who caused the tranquility to descend into the hearts of the ones who believe that they add belief to their belief. And to God belongs the armies of the heavens and the earth. And God had been Knowing, Wise
that He causes to enter the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever, and that He absolve them of their evil deeds. And that had been with God a winning a sublime triumph
And that He punish the males, ones who are hypocrites and the females, ones who are hypocrites and the males, ones who are polytheists and the females, ones who are polytheists, the ones who think an evil thought about God, a reprehensible thought, for them is the reprehensible turn of fortune. And God was angry with them. And He cursed them and prepared hell for them. And how evil a Homecoming
And to God belongs the armies of the heavens and the earth. And God had been Almighty, Wise
Truly, We sent thee as one who bears witness and one who gives good tidings and as a warner
so that you believe in God and His Messenger and that you support him and revere Him and glorify Him at early morning dawn and eventide
Truly, those who take the pledge of allegiance to thee, take the pledge of alliance only to God. The hand of God is over their hands. Then, whoever broke his oath, breaks his oath only to the harm of himself. And whoever lived up to what he made as a contract with God, He will give him a sublime compensation
The ones who are left behind will say to thee among the nomads: Our property and our people occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us. They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say: Who, then, has sway over you against God at all if He wanted to harm you or wanted to bring you profit? Nay! God had been aware of what you do
Nay! You thought that the Messenger would never turn about and the ones who believe to their people ever, and that was made to appear pleasing in your hearts. But you thought a reprehensible thought, and you had been a lost folk
And whoever believes not in God and His Messenger, truly, We made ready a blaze for the ones who are ungrateful
And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And God had been Forgiving, Compassionate
The ones who are left behind will say when you set out to take the gains: Let us follow you. They want to substitute for the assertion of God. Say: You will not follow us. Thus, God said before; then, they will say: Nay! You are jealous of us. Nay! They had not been understanding, but a little
Say to the ones who are left behind among the nomads: You will be called against a folk imbued with severe might. You will fight them or they will submit to God. Then, if you obey, God will give you a fairer compensation. But if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment
There is neither a fault on the blind, nor a fault on the lame, nor a fault on the sick, and whoever obeys God and His Messenger, He will cause him to enter Gardens beneath which rivers run. And whoever turns away, He will punish him with a painful punishment
God was well-pleased with the ones who believe (f) when they take the pledge of allegiance to thee beneath the tree for He knew what was in their hearts and He caused the tranquility to descend on them and He repaid them with a victory near at hand
And they will take much gain. And God had been Almighty, Wise
God promised you much gain that you will take and He quickened this for you. He limited the hands of humanity from you so that perhaps it will be a sign to the ones who believe and that He guide you to a straight path
and other gains which are not yet within your power. Surely, God enclosed them. And God had been over everything Powerful
And if those who were ungrateful fought you, they would have turned their backs. Again, they would not have found a protector or a helper
This is a custom of God which was, surely, in force before. Thou wilt never find in a custom of God any substitution
And He it is who limited their hands from you and your hands from them in the hollow of Makkah after He made you victors over them. And God had been Seeing of what you do
They were ungrateful, and they barred you from the Masjid al-Haram, and were ones who detained the sacrificial gift from reaching its place of sacrifice. If it had not been for men, ones who believe, and for women, ones who believe, whom you know not that you tread on them and guilt should light on you without your knowledge. This was so that God may cause to enter into His mercy whomever He wills. If they were clearly apart, separated, We would have punished those who were ungrateful among them with a painful punishment
Mention when those who were ungrateful laid zealotry in their hearts, like the zealotry of the Age of Ignorance. Then, God caused to descend His tranquility on His Messenger and on the ones who believe and fastened on them the Word of God-consciousness. They had been with right to it and were more worthy of it. And God had been Knowing
Certainly, God was sincere to the dream of His Messenger with The Truth: You will enter the Masjid al-Haram, if God willed, as ones who are safe, as ones who shaved your heads or as ones whose hair is cut short. You will fear not. He knew what you know not and He assigned other than that a victory near at hand
He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the way of life of The Truth that He uplift it over all of the ways of life. And God sufficed as a witness
Muhammad is the Messenger of God. And those who are with him are severe against the one who is ungrateful, but compassionate among themselves. Thou hast seen them as ones who bow down as ones who prostrate themselves. They are looking for grace from God and contentment. Their mark is on their faces from the effects of prostration. This is their parable in the Torah. And their parable in the Gospel is like sown seed that brought out its shoot, energized. It, then, became stout and rose straight on its plant stalk impressing the ones who sow so that He enrage by them the ones who are ungrateful, God promised those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them forgiveness and a sublime compensation
O those who believed! Put not yourselves forward in advance of God and His Messenger. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Hearing, Knowing
O those who believed! Exalt not your voices above the voice of the Prophet nor publish a saying to him as you would openly publish something to some others so that your actions not be fruitless while you are not aware
Truly, those who lower their voices near the Messenger of God, those are those who are ones God put to test their hearts for God-consciousness. For them is forgiveness and a sublime compensation
Truly, those who cry out to thee from behind the inner apartments, most of them are not reasonable
And if they endured patiently until thou wouldst go forth to them, it would have been better for them. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
O those who believed! If one who disobeys drew near to you with a tiding, then, be clear so that you not light on a folk out of ignorance. Then, you would become ones who are remorseful for what you accomplished
Know you that the Messenger of God is of you. If he obeys you in much of the affairs, you would, certainly, fall into misfortune. But God endeared belief to you and made it appear pleasing to your hearts. And He caused to be detestable to you ingratitude and disobedience and rebellion. Those, they are the ones who are on the right way
This is a grace from God and His divine blessing. And God is Knowing, Wise
And if two sections among the ones who believe fought one against the other, then, make things right between them both. Then, if one of them was insolent against the other, then, fight the one who is insolent until it changed its mind about the command of God. Then, if it changes its mind, make things right between them justly. And act justly. Truly, God loves the ones who act justly
Only the ones who believe are brothers/sisters, so make things right between your two brothers/sisters. And be Godfearing of God so that perhaps you will find mercy
O those who believed! Let not a folk deride another folk. Perhaps they be better than they, nor women deride other women. Perhaps they be better than they. Nor find fault with one another nor insult one another with nicknames. Miserable was the name of disobedience after belief! And whoever repents not, then, those, they are the ones who are unjust
O those who believed! Avoid suspicion much. Truly, some suspicion is a sin. And spy not nor backbite some by some other. Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his lifeless brother? You would have disliked it. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Accepter of Repentance, Compassionate
O humanity! Truly, We created you from a male and a female and made you into peoples and types that you recognize one another. Truly, the most generous of you with God is the most devout. Truly, God is Knowing, Aware
The nomads said: We believed. Say to them: You believe not. But say: We submitted to God, for belief enters not yet into your hearts. But if you obey God and His Messenger, He will not withhold your actions at all. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
The ones who believe are not but those who believed in God and His Messenger. Again, they were not in doubt and they struggled with their wealth and themselves in the way of God. Those, they are the ones who are sincere
Say: Would you teach God about your way of life while God knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth? And God is Knowing of everything
They show grace to thee that they submitted to God. Say: Show you submission to God as grace to me? Nay! God shows grace to you in that He guided you to belief if you, truly, had been ones who are sincere
Truly, God knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth. And God is Seeing of what you do
Q[f. By the glorious Quran]
Nay! They marveled that there drew near them one who warns from among themselves. So the ones who are ungrateful said: This is a strange thing
When we died and had been earth dust, that is a far-fetched returning
Surely, We knew what the earth reduces from them. And with Us is a guardian Book
Nay! They denied The Truth when it drew near them, so they are in a confused state of affairs
Look they not on the heaven above them, how We built it and made it appear pleasing? And there are not any gaps in it
And the earth, We stretched it out and cast on it firm mountains and caused in it to develop every lovely, diverse pair
for contemplation and as a reminder to every servant, one who turns in repentance
And We sent down blessed water from heaven. Then, We caused gardens to develop from it and reaped grains of wheat
and high-reaching date palm trees with ranged spathes
as provision for My servants. And We gave life by them to a lifeless land. Thus, will be the going forth
The folk of Noah denied what came before them, and the Companions of the Rass and Thamud
and Ad and Pharaoh and the brothers of Lot
and the Companions of the Thicket and the folk of Tubba. Everyone denied the Messengers, so My threat was realized
Were We wearied by the first creation? Nay! They are perplexed about a new creation
And, certainly, We created the human being. We know what evil his soul whispers to him. We are nearer to him than the jugular vein
When the two receivers are ones who receive, seated on the right and on the left
he utters not a saying but that there is one ready, watching over near him
when the agony of death drew near with The Truth. That is what thou hadst been shunning
And the trumpet will be blown. That is the Day of The Threat
And every person will draw near with an angel, one who drives, and an angel witness
Certainly, thou hadst been heedless of this so We removed thy screen from thee so that thy sight this Day will be sharp
And his comrade angel would say: This is what is ready near me of his record
Cast into hell every stubborn ingrate
who delays the good, one who exceeds the limits, one who is in grave doubt
he who made another god with God! Then, cast him into the severe punishment
His comrade Satan would say: Our Lord! I made him not overbold, but he had been going far astray
He would say: Strive not against one another in My presence, for, surely, I will put forward The Threat to you
The statement is not substituted in My presence and I am not unjust to the servants
On a Day when We will say to hell: Art thou full? And it will say: Are there any additions
And the Garden was brought close to the ones who are Godfearing, not far off
This is what is promised you, for every penitent and guardian
who dreaded The Merciful in the unseen and drew near with a heart of one who turns in repentance
Enter you there in peace. That is the Day of Eternity
They will have what they will in it and with Us there is yet an addition
And how many We caused to perish before them of generations who were stronger than they in courage so that they searched about on the land. Was there any asylum
Truly, in that is a reminder for him, for whoever had a heart or, having the ability to hear, gave listen. He is a witness
And, certainly, We created the heavens and the earth and whatever is between in six days, and no exhaustion afflicted Us
So have thou patience with whatever they say and glorify with the praise of thy Lord before the coming up of the sun and before sunset
And in the night glorify Him and at the end part of the prostrations
And listen thou on a Day when one who calls out will cry out from a near place
On a Day when they will hear the Cry with The Truth. That will be the Day of going forth
Truly, it is We who give life and cause to die and to Us is the Homecoming
on a Day when the earth will be split open swiftly. That will be an easy assembling for Us
We are greater in knowledge as to what they say. And thou art not haughty over them so remind by the Quran whoever fears My threat
By the winnowing winds of ones that winnow
by the burden-bearers, the ones who carry a heavy burden
and the ones that run with ease
and the ones who distribute the command
truly, what you are promised is that which is sincere
And, truly, the judgment is that which falls
By the heaven that is full of tracks
you are ones who are at variance in your sayings
He is misled there by he who was misled
Perdition to those who guess
ones who are inattentive because of obstinacy
They ask: When will the Day of Judgment be
A Day when they are tried over the fire
Experience your test. This is that for which you had been seeking to hasten
Truly, the ones who are Godfearing will be in the Garden and springs
ones who take what their Lord gave them. Truly, they had been before this—ones who are doers of good
They had been slumbering little during the night
And at the breaking of the day, they ask for forgiveness
And there is an obligation from their wealth for the one who begs and the one who is deprived
On the earth are signs, for the ones that are certain
and in yourselves. Will you not, then, perceive
And in the heaven is your provision as you are promised
by the Lord of the heaven and the earth. It is, truly, The Truth just as you yourselves speak
Truly, approached thee the discourse of guests of Abraham, the ones who are honored
When they entered to him they said: Peace. He said: Peace, to a folk, ones who are unknown
Then, he turned upon his people and brought about a fattened calf
so he brought it near to them. He said: Will you not eat
Then, he sensed a fear of them; they said: Be not in awe. They gave him good tidings of a knowing boy
Then, his woman came forward with a loud cry. She slapped her face and said: I am an old barren woman
They said: Thus, spoke thy Lord. Truly, He is The Wise, The Knowing
Abraham said: O ones who are sent, what is your business
They said: That we were sent to a folk, ones who sin
to send on them rocks of clay
ones distinguished by thy Lord for ones who are excessive
So We brought out whoever had been in it of the ones who believe
But We found in it nothing but a house of ones who submit to God
And We left a sign in it for those who fear the painful punishment
And in Moses, then, We sent him to Pharaoh with a clear authority
Then, Pharaoh turned away to his court. He said: One who is a sorcerer, one who is possessed
So We took him and his armies and cast them forth into the water of the sea and he is one who is answerable
And in Ad, when We sent against them the withering wind
It forsakes not anything it approached, but made it like it was decayed
And in Thamud, when it was said to them: Take joy for a while
Yet they defied the command of their Lord so the thunderbolt took them while they look on
They were neither able to stand up nor had they been ones who are aided
And the folk of Noah from before. Truly, they had been a folk, ones who disobey
And We built the heaven with potency. And, truly, We are ones who extend wide
And the earth, We spread it forth. How excellent are the ones who spread
And of everything We created pairs so that perhaps you will recollect
So run away towards God. Truly, I am to you a clear warner from Him
And make not with God any other god. Truly, I am to you a clear warner from Him
There approached not those who were before them any Messenger but that they said: One who is a sorcerer or one who is possessed
Counseled they this to one another? Nay! They are a folk, ones who are defiant
So turn thou away from them that thou be not one who is reproached
And remind, for, truly, the reminder profits the ones who believe
And I created not jinn and humankind but that they worship Me
I want no provision from them nor want I that they feed Me
Truly, God, He is The Provider, The Possessor of Strength, The Sure
And, truly, the impiety of those who did wrong is like the impiety of their companions. So let them not seek to hasten the Judgment
Then, woe to those who disbelieved in that Day of theirs that they are promised
By the mount
and by a Book inscribed
on an unrolled scroll of parchment
and by the frequented House
and by the exalted roof
and that which is poured forth over the seas
truly, the punishment of Thy Lord is that which falls
There is no one who averts it
On a Day when the heaven will spin a spinning
and the mountains will journey a journey
Then, woe on a Day to the ones who deny
they, those are engaging in idle talk, play
on a Day they will be driven away with force to the fire of hell with a driving away
This is the fire which you had been denying
Is this, then, sorcery or is it that you perceive not
Roast you in it! Then, have patience, or you endure patiently not, it is all the same to you. You will be only given recompense for what you had been doing
Truly, the ones who are Godfearing will be in Gardens and bliss
ones who are joyful for what their Lord gave them. And their Lord protected them from the punishment of hellfire
Eat and drink wholesomely because of what you had been doing
They will be ones who are reclining on couches arrayed. And We will give in marriage to them lovely, most beautiful eyed ones
And those who believed and their offspring who followed them in belief, We caused them to join their offspring. And We deprived them not of anything of their actions. Every man will be pledged for what he earned
And We furnished relief to them with sweet fruit and meat such as that for which they lust
They will contend with one another for a cup around which there is no idle talk nor accusation of sinfulness
And boys of theirs will go around them as if they had been well-guarded pearls
And some of them will come forward to some others demanding of one another
They would say: Truly, we had been before ones who are apprehensive among our people
but God showed grace to us and protected us from the punishment of the burning wind
Truly, we had been calling to Him before. Truly, He, He is The Source of Goodness, The Compassionate
So remind! Thou art not, by the divine blessing of thy Lord, a soothsayer nor one who is possessed
Or they say: A poet! We await for the setback of fate for him
Say: Await for I am with the ones who are waiting
Or command their faculties of understanding to this? Or are they a folk, ones who are defiant
Or say they: He fabricated it? Nay! They believe not
Then, let them bring a discourse like it, if they had been ones who are sincere
Or were they created out of nothing? Or are they ones who are creators of themselves
Or created they the heavens and the earth? Nay! They are not certain
Or are the treasures of thy Lord with them? Or are they ones who are registrars
Or have they a ladder by means of which they listen? Then, let ones who are listening bring a clear authority
Or has He daughters and they have sons
Or hast thou asked them for a compensation so that they are from something owed ones who will be weighed down
Or is the unseen with them and they write it down
Or want they cunning? But it is those who were ungrateful. They are the ones who are outwitted
Or have they a god other than God? Glory be to God above partners they ascribe
And if they consider pieces of the heaven descending, they would say: Heaped up clouds
So forsake them until they encounter their day in which they will be swooning
A Day when their cunning will avail them not at all nor will they be helped
And, truly, for those who did wrong there is a punishment besides that, but most of them know not
So have thou patience for the determination of thy Lord, for, truly, thou art under Our eyes; and glorify the praises of thy Lord when thou hast stood up at the time of dawn
and glorify at night and the drawing back of the stars
By the star when it hurled to ruin
neither your companion went astray, nor he erred
nor speaks he for himself out of desire
It is but a revelation that is revealed
taught to him by The One Stronger in Strength
Possessor of Forcefulness. Then, he stood poised
while he was on the loftiest horizon
Again, he came to pass near and hung suspended
until he had been at a distance of two bow lengths or closer
Then, He revealed to His servant what He revealed
The mind lied not against what it saw
Will you altercate with him about what he sees
And, certainly, he saw it another time
near the Lote Tree of the Utmost Boundary
near which is the Garden of the Place of Shelter
when overcomes the Lote Tree what overcomes it
The sight swerved not, nor was it defiant
Certainly, he saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord
Saw you, then, al-Lat and al-Uzza
and Manat, the third, the other
Have you males and has He, females
That, then, is an unfair division
They are but names that you named, you and your fathers, for which God caused not to descend any authority. They follow nothing but opinion and that for which their souls yearn. And, certainly, drew near them the guidance from their Lord
Or will the human being have what he coveted
Then, to God belongs the Last and the First
And how many an angel in the heavens is there whose intercession will avail nothing at all, but after God gives permission to whom He wills and He is well-pleased
Truly, those who believe not in the world to come naming the angels with female names
while they have no knowledge of it, they follow nothing but opinion. And, truly, opinion avails them not at all against The Truth
So turn thou aside from him who turns away from Our Remembrance and he wants nothing but this present life
That is their attainment of the knowledge. Truly, thy Lord, He is the One Who is greater in knowledge of whoever went astray from His way. And He is greater in knowledge of whoever were truly guided
And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth that He may give recompense to those who did evil for what they did and give recompense fairer to those who did good
those who avoid the major sins and the indecencies but the lesser offenses. Truly, thy Lord is One Who is Extensive in forgiveness. He is greater in knowledge of you when He caused you to grow from the earth and when you were an unborn child in the wombs of your mothers. So you make not pure yourselves. He is greater in knowledge of him who was Godfearing
Hadst thou considered him who turned away
and gave a little, giving grudgingly
Is the knowledge of the unseen with him so that he sees it
Or is he told what is in the scrolls of Moses
and of Abraham who paid his account in full
The burdened soul will not bear the heavy load of another
The human being is not but what he endeavored for
and that his endeavoring will be seen
Again, he will be given recompense for it with a more true recompense
and that towards thy Lord is the Utmost Boundary
and that He caused laughter and caused weeping
and that He caused to die and gave life
and it is He, He created the pairs, the male and the female
from seminal fluid when it is emitted
and that with Him is another growth
and it is He, He Who Enriched and made rich
and that He, He is the Lord of Sirius
and that He caused to perish the previous Ad
and Thamud. He caused none to remain
—and the folk of Noah before. Truly, they had been they who do greater wrong and ones who are defiant
He caused to tumble that which are cities overthrown
then, enwrapped them with what enwrapped
Then, which of the benefits of thy Lord wilt thou quarrel with
This is a warner among the previous warnings
The Impending Day is impending
There is not other than God, One Who Uncovers it
Then, at this discourse you marvel
And will you laugh and not weep
while you are ones who pass life in enjoyment
So prostrate yourselves to God and worship Him.‡
The Hour neared and the moon was split
And if they see a sign, they turn aside and say: Incessant sorcery
And they denied and followed their own desires. And every affair is that which is settled
And, certainly, the tidings drew near them wherein was that which is to deter
—namely, that which is far reaching wisdom— yet warnings avail not
So turn thou away from them• on a Day when One Who Calls will call to a horrible thing
Their sight will be that which is humbled and they will go forth from the tombs as if they had been dispersed locusts
ones who run forward with their eyes fixed in horror towards The One Who Calls. The ones who are ungrateful will say: This is a difficult Day
The folk of Noah denied before them. They denied Our servant and said: One who is possessed! And he was deterred
So he called to his Lord saying: I am one who is vanquished, so Thou help me
So We opened the doors of heaven with torrential water
And We caused the earth to gush forth with springs so the waters were to meet one another from a command that was measured
And We carried him on a vessel of planks and caulked
running under Our eyes, a recompense for Noah who had been disbelieved
And, certainly, We left this as a sign. Then, is there one who recalls
So how had been My punishment and My warning
And, certainly, We made the Quran easy as a Remembrance. Then, is there one who recalls
Ad denied. So how had been My punishment and My warning
Truly, We sent a raging wind against them on a day of continuous misfortune
tearing out humanity as if they had been uprooted palm trees, uprooted
So how had been My punishment and My warning
And, certainly, We made the Quran easy as a Remembrance. Then, is there one who recalls
Thamud denied the warning
for they said: Follow we a lone mortal from among us? Truly, we would be going astray and insane
Is it that the Remembrance was cast down to Salih from among us? Nay! He is a rash liar
They will know tomorrow who the rash liar is
Truly, We are ones who sent the she-camel as a test for them. So thou be on the watch for them and maintain patience
And tell them that the division of the water is between them. Every drink was that which is divided in turn
But they cried out to their companion, and he took her in hand and crippled her
So how had been My punishment and My warning
Truly, We sent against them one Cry and they had been like straw for the one who is a builder of animal enclosures
And, certainly, We made the Quran easy as a Remembrance. Then, is there one who recalls
The folk of Lot denied the warning
Truly, We sent against them a sand storm, but the family of Lot. We delivered them at the breaking of day
as a divine blessing from Us. Thus, We gave recompense to him who gave thanks
And, certainly, he warned them of Our attack but they quarreled over the warning
And, certainly, they solicited his guests, so We obliterated their eyes. Then, experience My punishment and My warning
And, certainly, it came in the morning, early morning at dawn, a settled punishment
Then, experience My punishment and My warning
And, certainly, We made the Quran easy as a Remembrance. Then, is there one who recalls
And, certainly, drew near the warning to the people of Pharaoh
They denied Our signs, all of them. So We took them with a taking, One Who is Almighty, Omnipotent
Are ones who are ungrateful better than those? Or have you an immunity in the ancient scrolls
Or say they: We are aided altogether
Their multitude will be put to flight and they will turn their backs
Nay! The Hour is what is promised them and the Hour will be more calamitous and more distasteful
Truly, ones who sin are going astray and insane
On a Day they will be dragged into the fire on their faces: Experience the touch of Saqar
Truly, We created all things in measure
and Our command is not but one as the twinkling of the eye
And, certainly, We caused to perish their partisans. Is there, then, one who recalls
And everything they accomplished is in the ancient scrolls
And every small and great thing is that which is written
Truly, the ones who are Godfearing will be in Gardens and rivers
in positions of sincerity near an Omnipotent King
The Merciful
He taught the Quran
He created the human being
He taught him the clear explanation
The sun and the moon are to keep count
And the stars and the trees both prostrate
And the heaven He exalted. And He set in place the Balance
that you be not defiant in the Balance
Set up the weighing with justice and skimp not in the Balance
And He set the earth in place for the human race
On and in it are many kinds of sweet fruit and date palm trees with sheathed fruit trees
and grain possessor of husks and fragrant herbs
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
He created the human being from earth mud like potter’s clay
He created the ones who are spirits from a smokeless flame of fire
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
The Lord of the Two Easts, and the Lord of the Two Wests
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
He let forth the two seas to meet one another
Between them is a barrier which they wrong not
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
From both of them go forth pearls and coral
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
His are ones that run with that which is displayed in the sea like landmarks
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
All who are in or on it are ones who are being annihilated
yet the Countenance of thy Lord will remain forever, Possessor of The Majesty and The Splendor
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Of Him asks whoever is in the heavens and in and on the earth. Every day He is on some matter
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
We will attend to you at leisure, O you two dependents
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
O you both, assembly of jinn and humankind! If you were able to pass through the areas of the heavens and the earth, then, pass through them! But you will not pass through, but with an authority
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
There will be sent against you both a flame of fire and heated brass. Will you not, then, help yourselves
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Then, when the heaven was split then, it had been crimson like red leather
so which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
On that Day no one will be asked about his impiety neither humankind nor ones who are spirits
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Ones who sin will be recognized by their mark and they will be taken by their forelocks and their feet
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
This is hell which the ones who sin deny
They will go around between it and between scalding boiling water
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
For him who feared the station before his Lord are two Gardens
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Possessor of wide shade
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Two springs will be running
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
In them both every kind of sweet fruit of diverse pairs
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Ones who are reclining on places of restfulness the inner linings of which are of brocade. And the fruit plucked from trees while fresh, that which draws near from the two Gardens
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
In them both are ones who are restraining their (f) glance. No humankind touched them (f) sexually before nor ones who are spirits
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
They are as if they were like rubies and coral
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Is the recompense for kindness other than kindness
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Besides these are two other Gardens
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Dark green
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
In them both are two springs gushing
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
In them both are sweet fruits and date palm trees and pomegranates
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
In them both are the good deeds, fairer
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Most beautiful eyed ones who will be restrained in edifices
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
No humankind touched them (f) sexually before nor ones who are spirits
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Ones who are reclining on green pillows and fairer carpets
So which of the benefits of the Lord of you both will you both deny
Blessed be the Name of thy Lord, Possessor of The Majesty and The Splendor
When The Inevitable came to pass
its descent is not like that which lies
It will be one that abases, one that exalts
When the earth will rock with a rocking
and the mountains be crumbled to dust, crumbling
then, they had been dust scattered about
And you had been of three diverse pairs
Then, the Companions of the Right—who are the Companions of the Right
And the Companions of the Left—who are Companions of the Left
Ones who take the lead are the ones who take the lead
Those are the ones who are brought near
in the Gardens of Bliss
A throng of the ancient ones
and a few of the later ones
are on lined couches
ones who are reclining on them, ones who are facing one another
Immortal children go around them
with cups and ewers and goblets from a spring of water
Neither will they suffer headaches nor will they be intoxicated
and sweet fruit of what they specify
and the flesh of birds for which they lust
and most beautiful eyed ones
like the parable of the well-guarded pearls
a recompense for what they had been doing
They will not hear any idle talk in it nor accusation of sinfulness
but the saying of: Peace! Peace
And the Companions of the Right—who are the Companions of the Right
They will be among thornless lote-trees
and acacias, one on another
and spread out shade
and outpoured water
and many sweet fruit
There will be neither that which is severed nor that which is inaccessible
And it is an exalted place of restfulness
Truly, We caused them (f) to grow, a good forming
and made them (f) virgins
full of love, of the same age
for the Companions of the Right
A throng of the ancient ones
and a throng from the later ones
and the Companions of the Left—who are the Companions of the Left
Those who are in burning wind and scalding water
and shade of black smoke
neither that which is cool nor generous
Truly, they had been before that ones who are given ease
and they had been persisting in tremendous wickedness
And they had been saying: When we died and had been earth dust and bones, will we, then, be ones who are raised up
And our ancient fathers
Say: Truly, the ancient ones and the later ones
will be ones who will be gathered to a time appointed on a known Day
Again, you, O ones who go astray, are the ones who deny
Certainly, you will be ones who eat from the Zaqqum tree
Then, you will be ones who fill your bellies from it
then, ones who drink scalding water after it
So you will be ones who drink like the drinking of thirsty camels
This will be their hospitality on the Day of Judgment
We, We created you. Why establish it not as true
Considered you what you spill of human seed
Is it you who create it? Or are We the ones who are the creators
We ordained death among you and We will not be ones who will be outrun
in that We will substitute your likeness and We caused you to grow in a way you know not
And, certainly, you knew the first growth. Will you not, then, recollect
Considered you the soil that you till
Is it you who sows it? Or are We the ones who sow
If We will, We would make it into chaff and you would continue to joke saying
We are ones who are debt-loaded
Nay! We are ones who are deprived
Considered you the water that you drink
Is it you who caused it to descend from the cloud vapors? Or are We the ones who caused it to descend
If We will, We would make it bitter. Why, then, give you not thanks
Considered you the fire which you strike
Is it you who caused the tree to grow? Or are We the ones who cause it to grow
We made it an admonition and sustenance for ones who are desert people
Then, glorify with the name of thy Lord, The Sublime
But no! I swear by the orbit of the stars
and, truly, that is an oath to be sworn if you know, sublime
Truly, it is a generous Recitation
in a well-guarded Book
None touches it but the ones who are purified
a sending down successively from the Lord of the worlds
Then, is it this discourse that you are ones who scorn
And you make it your provision that you, you deny the Recitation
Then, why not intervene when it reached the wind-pipe
and you are looking on at the time
And We are nearer to him than you, yet you perceive not
Then, why had you not been—if you are not ones to be judged—
returning the soul to the body, if you had been ones who are sincere
If he had been among the ones who are brought near
there is solace and fragrant herbs and a Garden of Bliss
And if he had been of the Companions of the Right
then: Peace for thee from the Companions of the Right
And yet if he had been of the ones who go astray, ones who deny
then, a hospitality of scalding water
and broiling in hellfire
Truly, this is The Truth of certainty
So glorify the Name of thy Lord, The Almighty
Whatever is in the heavens glorified God and whatever is in and on the earth. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes to die. And He is Powerful over everything
He is The First and The Last, The One Who is Outward and The One Who is Inward. And He is Knowing of everything
It is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days. Again, He turned His attention to the Throne. He knows what penetrates into the earth and what goes forth from it, and what comes down from the heaven and what goes up to it. And He is with you wherever you had been. And God is Seeing of what you do
To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. All commands are returned to God
He causes the nighttime to be interposed into the daytime and causes the daytime to be interposed into the nighttime. And He is Knowing of whatever is in the breasts
Believe in God and His Messenger and spend out of what He made you ones who are successors in it. Those among you who believed and spent, for them is a great compensation
And what is the matter with you that you believe not in God while the Messenger calls to you to believe in your Lord and He took your solemn promise, if you had been ones who believe
It is He Who sends down to His servant clear portents, signs, that He brings you out from the shadows into the light. And, truly, God is to you Gentle, Compassionate
And what is the matter with you that you spend not in the way of God while to God belongs the heritage of the heavens and the earth? Not on the same level among you are whoever spent before the victory and fought. Those are more sublime in degree than those who spent afterwards and fought. And God promised the fairer to all. And God is Aware of what you do
Who is he who will lend to God a fairer loan that He multiply it for him and he will have a generous compensation
On a Day thou wilt see the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe, their light coming eagerly in advance of them and on their right: Good tidings for you this Day, Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever. That, it is the winning the sublime triumph
On a Day will say the males, ones who are hypocrites and females, the ones who are hypocrites to those who believed: Wait for us that we will borrow from your light. It will be said: Return behind and search out for a light. There would be a fence set up between them for which there is a door. That which is inward is mercy and that which is outward is towards the punishment
The hypocrites will cry out to the believers: Have we not been with you? They will say: Yea! And you let yourselves be tempted and you awaited and you were in doubt and you were deluded by following your fantasies until the command of God drew near and the deluder deluded you in regard to God
So this Day ransom will not be taken from you nor from those who were ungrateful. Your place of shelter will be the fire. It is your defender. And miserable will be the Homecoming
Is it not time for those who believed that their hearts be humbled by the Remembrance of God and to The Truth that came down to them and that they not be like those who were given the Book before? Then, the space of time was long for them so their hearts became hard. And many of them were ones who disobey
Know you that God gives life to the earth after its death. Surely, We made manifest the signs to you so that perhaps you will be reasonable
Truly, the males, ones who are charitable and the females, ones who are charitable and who lent a fairer loan to God, it will be multiplied for them and for them there is a generous compensation
And those who believed in God and His Messengers, those, they are the just persons. And the witnesses to their Lord. For them is their compensation and their light. And those who were ungrateful and denied Our signs, those are the Companions of Hellfire
Know that this present life is only a pastime, a diversion and an adornment and a mutual boasting among you and a rivalry in respect to wealth and children as the likeness of plenteous rain water. The plants impressed ones who are ungrateful. Again, it withers; then, thou hast seen it yellowing. Again, it becomes chaff while in the world to come there is severe punishment and forgiveness from God and contentment. And this present life is nothing but a delusion of enjoyment
Move quickly towards forgiveness from your Lord and the Garden whose depth is as the breadth of the heavens and earth. It was prepared for those who believed in God and His Messengers. That is the grace of God. He gives it to whom He wills. And God is The Possessor of the Sublime Grace
And no affliction lit on the earth nor on yourselves but it is in a Book that We fashion before. Truly, that is easy for God
so that you not grieve over what slipped away from you nor be glad because of what was given to you. And God loves not any proud, boaster
those who are misers and who command humanity to miserliness, and whoever turns away then, God, He is The Sufficient, The Worthy of Praise
Certainly, We sent Our Messengers with the clear portents and We caused the Book to descend with them and the Balance so that humanity may uphold equity. And We caused iron to descend in which is vigorous might and profits for humanity that perhaps God would know whoever helps Him and His Messengers in the unseen. Truly, God is Strong, Almighty
And, certainly, We sent Noah and Abraham and We assigned to their offspring prophethood and the Book. And of them are ones who are truly guided while many of them are ones who disobey
Again, We sent Our Messengers following their footsteps. And We sent following them Jesus son of Mary. And We gave him the Gospel. And We assigned in the hearts of those who followed him, tenderness and mercy. But as for monasticism, they made it up themselves. We prescribed it not for them but they were so looking for the contentment of God. Then, they gave it not the attention giving its right attention so We gave those who believed among them their compensation. And many of them are ones who disobey
O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God and believe in His Messenger. He will give you a double like part of His mercy. And He assigns you a light to walk by. And He will forgive you. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Certainly, the People of the Book know that they have no power over anything of the grace of God and that the grace of God is in the hand of God. He gives it to whomever He wills. And God is Possessor of the Sublime Grace
Surely, God heard the saying of she who disputes with thee about her spouse and she complains to God and God hears conversing between you both. Truly, God is Hearing, Seeing
Those who say to their wives: Be as my mother’s back, they (f) are not their mothers. Their mothers are only those (f) who gave them birth. And, truly, they say that which is unlawful among their sayings and an untruth. And, truly, God is Pardoning, Forgiving
And those who say: Be as my mother’s back, to their wives and again, retract what they said, then, the letting go of a bondsperson before they both touch one another. That is of what you are admonished. And God is Aware of what you do
He who finds not such means then, formal fasting for two successive months before they both touch one another. And for him who is unable to fast, the feeding of sixty needy persons. That is so that you believe in God and His Messenger. And those are the ordinances of God. And for the ones who are ungrateful, a painful punishment
Truly, those who oppose God and His Messenger, they were suppressed as those who before them were suppressed. And, surely, We caused clear portents, signs to descend. For the ones who are ungrateful is a despised punishment
on a Day when God will raise them up altogether and tell them of what they did. God counted it while they forgot it. And God is a Witness over everything
Hast thou not considered that God knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in and on the earth. There will be no conspiring secretly of three, but He is their fourth nor of five, but He is the sixth, nor of fewer than that nor of more, but He is with them wherever they had been. Again, He will tell them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Truly, God is Knowing of everything
Hast thou not considered those who were prohibited from conspiring secretly? Again, they revert to what they were prohibited from and hold secret counsel in sin and deep-seated dislike and in opposition to the Messenger? And when they drew near thee they gave thee greetings with that with which God gives not as a greeting to thee and they say to themselves: Why punishes us not God for what we say? Hell will be enough for them. They will roast in it. Then, miserable will be the Homecoming
O those who believed! When you hold secret counsel, hold not secret counsel in sin and deep-seated dislike and in opposition to the Messenger. But hold secret counsel for virtuous conduct and God-consciousness and be Godfearing of God before Whom you will be assembled
Conspiring secretly is only from Satan that he dishearten those who believed. But he is not one who injures them at all, but with the permission of God. In God let the ones who believe put their trust
O those who believed! When it was said to you: Make ample space in the assemblies, then, make room. God will make room for you. And when it was said: Move up, then, move up. God will exalt those among you who believed and those who were given the knowledge in degrees. And God is Aware of what you do
O those who believed! When you consulted with the Messenger, put charity forward in advance of your conversing privately. That is better for you and purer. But if you find not the means, then, truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Are you apprehensive to put forward charity in advance of your conversing privately? If, then, you accomplish it not, God turned in forgiveness to you. Perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and obey God and His Messenger. And God is Aware of what you do
Hast thou considered those who turned in friendship to a folk against whom God was angry? They are not of you, nor are you of them and they swear to a lie while they know
God prepared a severe punishment for them. Truly, they, how evil is what they had been doing
They took their oaths to themselves as a pretext and they barred from the way of God. So for them is a despised punishment
Avails them not their wealth and their children against God at all. Those will be the Companions of the Fire. They are ones who will dwell in it forever
On a Day when God will raise them up altogether, then, they will swear to Him as they swear to you, assuming that they are something. They, they are ones who lie
Satan gained mastery over them, so he caused them to forget the Remembrance of God. Those are of the Party of Satan. Regard the Party of Satan, they will be the ones who are losers
Truly, those who oppose God and His Messenger, those are among the humiliated in spirit
God prescribed: I will prevail, truly, I and My Messengers. Truly, God is Strong, Almighty
Thou wilt not find any folk who believe in God and the Last Day who make friends with whoever opposed God and His Messenger even if they had been their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kinspeople. Those, He prescribed belief in their hearts, and confirmed them with a Spirit from Himself. And He will cause them to enter Gardens beneath which rivers run as ones who will dwell in them forever. God was well-pleased with them and they were well-pleased with Him. Those are the Party of God. Lo! the Party of God. They are the ones who prosper
Whatever is in the heavens glorified God and whatever is in and on the earth. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
It is He Who drove out those who were ungrateful—among the People of the Book—from their abodes at the first assembling. You thought that they would not go forth. And they thought that they are ones who are secure in their fortresses from God. But God approached them from where they anticipate not. And He hurled alarm into their hearts. They devastate their own houses with their own hands and the hands of the ones who believe. Then, take warning, O those imbued with insight
If God prescribed not banishment for them, He would have punished them in the present. And for them in the world to come would be the punishment of the fire
That is because they make a breach with God and His Messenger. And whoever made a breach with God, then, truly, God is Severe in repayment
Whatever palm trees you severed or left them as ones that arise from their roots, it was with the permission of God and so that He might cover with shame the ones who disobey
And what God gave as spoils of war to His Messenger from them, you spurred not an animal for an expedition, neither any horse nor riding camel, but God gives authority to His Messengers over whomever He wills. And God is Powerful over everything
What God gave to His Messenger as spoils of war from the people of the towns is for God and His Messenger and the possessors of kinship and the orphans and the needy and the traveler of the way so that it be changing not hands between the rich among you. And whatever the Messenger gave you, take it. And refrain yourselves from what he prohibited you. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Severe in repayment
For the poor who were of the ones who emigrate, those who were driven out from their abodes and their property, looking for grace from God and His contentment and they help God and His Messenger, there is also a share. Those, they are the ones who are sincere
And those who took their abodes as dwellings and had belief before them, love them who emigrated to them and they find not in their breasts any need for what the emigrants were given and hold them in greater favor over themselves even though they themselves had been in destitution. And whoever is protected from his own stinginess, then, those, they are the ones who prosper
And those who drew near after them, they say: Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers/sisters who preceded us in belief and make not in our hearts any grudge against those who believed. Our Lord! Truly, Thou art Gentle, Compassionate
Hast thou not considered those who are ones who are hypocrites? They say to their brothers—those who were ungrateful— among the People of the Book: If you were driven out, we, certainly, will go forth with you and we will never obey anyone against you ever. And if you were fought against, we will, certainly, help you. And God bears witness that they, truly, are ones who lie
Certainly, if they were driven out, they would not go forth with them. And if they were fought against they would not help them. And if they had helped them, they would turn their backs. Again, they would not be helped by them
Truly, you are a more severe fright in their breasts than God. That is because they are a folk who understand not
They fight not against you altogether, but in fortified towns or from behind walls. Their might among themselves is very severe. You would assume them united, but their hearts are diverse. That is because they are a folk who are not reasonable
As the likeness of those who were before them, they experienced the immediate mischief of their affair and for them is a painful punishment
As the likeness of Satan when he said to the human being: Be Ungrateful! Then, when he was ungrateful, Satan said: I am free of thee. I fear God, the Lord of the worlds
The Ultimate End of both of them will be that they be in the fire, ones who will dwell in it forever. And that is the recompense of the ones who are unjust
O those who believed! Be Godfearing of God and let every soul look on what is put forward for tomorrow. And be Godfearing of God. Truly, God is Aware of what you do
And be not like those who forgot God and He caused them to forget themselves. Those, they are the ones who disobey
The Companions of the Fire are not equal to the Companions of the Garden. The Companions of the Garden, they are the ones who are victorious
If We had caused this, the Quran, to descend on a mountain, thou woudst have seen it as that which is humbled, one that is split open from dreading God. And there are the parables that We propound for humanity so that perhaps they will reflect
He is God; there is no god but He, One Who Knows of the unseen and the visible. He is The Merciful, The Compassionate
He is God besides whom there is no god but He, The King, The Holy, The Peaceable, One Who is The Bestower, Preserver, The Almighty, The Compeller, The One Who is The Supreme. Glory be to God above partners they ascribe
He is God, the One Who is Creator, The One Who Fashions, The One Who is The Giver of Form. To Him belongs the Fairer Names. Whatever is in the heavens glorifies Him and whatever is in and on the earth and He is The Almighty, The Wise
O those who believed! Take not My enemies to yourselves and your enemies as protectors, giving a proposal of affection towards them while they were ungrateful for what drew near you of The Truth. They drive out the Messenger and you because you believe in God, your Lord. If you had been going forth struggling in My way and looking for My goodwill, you keep secret affection for them. Yet I am greater in knowledge of what you concealed and what you spoke openly. And whoever accomplishes that among you, surely, he went astray from the right path
If they come upon you, they will be enemies against you. They extend their hands against you and their tongues with evil. And they wished that you be ungrateful
Your blood relations will never profit you nor your children. On the Day of Resurrection, He will distinguish among you. And God is Seeing of what you do
Surely, there had been a fairer, good example for you in Abraham and those with him when they said to their folk: Truly, we are released from obligation to you and whatever you worship other than God. We disbelieved in you. Shown itself between us and between you was enmity and hatred eternally until you believe in One God, but for Abraham saying to his father: Truly, I will ask for forgiveness for thee and I possess not anything for thee before God. Our Lord! In Thee we put our trust and to Thee we were penitent and to Thee is the Homecoming
Our Lord! Make us not be a cause of their pleasure for those who were ungrateful and forgive us. Our Lord; truly, Thou, Thou alone art The Almighty, The Wise
Certainly, there had been a fairer, good example in them for you for whoever had been hoping for God and the Last Day. And whoever turns away, then, truly, God, He is Sufficient, Worthy of Praise
Perhaps God will assign between you and between those to whom you were at enmity with them, affection. And God is Powerful. And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
God prohibits you not from those who fight not against you because of your way of life nor drive you out of your abodes so be good and act justly towards them. Truly, God loves the ones who act justly
God prohibits you only from those who fought against you in your way of life and drove you out of your abodes and were behind expelling you, that you turn to them in friendship. And whoever turns to them in friendship, then, those, they are the ones who are unjust
O those who believed! When the females, ones who believe, drew near to you, ones who emigrate (f), put them (f) to a test. God is greater in knowledge as to their (f) belief. Then, if you knew them (f) as ones who believe (f), return them (f) not to the ones who are ungrateful. They (f) are not allowed to them (m) nor are they (m) lawful for them (f). And give them (m) what they (m) have spent. There is no blame on you that you (m) marry them (f) when you have given them (f) their compensation. And hold back conjugal ties with the ones who are ungrateful and ask for what you (m) spent and let them ask for what they (m) spent. That is the determination of God. He gives judgment among you. And God is Knowing, Wise
And if any slipped away from you of your spouses to the ones who are ungrateful, then, you retaliated and give the like to whose spouses went of what they (m) spent. And be Godfearing of God in Whom you are ones who believe
O Prophet! When drew near thee the females, ones who are believers, to take the pledge of allegiance to thee that they will ascribe nothing as partners with God nor will they steal nor will they commit adultery nor will they kill their children, nor will they approach making false charges to harm another’s reputation that they devise between their (f) hands and their (f) feet, and that they rebel not against thee in anything that is honorable. Then, take their (f) pledge of allegiance and ask forgiveness from God for them (f). Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
O those who believed! Turn not in friendship to a folk against whom God was angry. Surely, they gave up hope for the world to come, just as gave up hope the ones who are ungrateful of the occupants of the graves
Whatever is in the heavens glorified God and whatever is in and on the earth. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
O those who believed! Why say you what you accomplish not
It was most troublesome, repugnant to God that you say what you accomplish not
Truly, God loves those who fight in His way, ranged in rows as if they were a well-compacted structure
And when Moses said to his folk: O my folk! Why malign me while, surely, you know that I am the Messenger of God to you? So when they swerved, God caused their hearts to swerve. And God guides not the folk, the ones who disobey
And when Jesus son of Mary said: O Children of Israel! I am the Messenger of God to you, one who establishes as true what was in advance of me in the Torah and one who gives good tidings of a Messenger to approach after me. His name will be Ahmad. But when he brought about the clear portents to them, they said: This is clear sorcery
And who does greater wrong than he who devised the lie against God while he is being called to submission to God? And God guides not the folk, ones who are unjust
They want to extinguish the light of God with their mouths but God is One Who Fulfills His light even though the ones who are ungrateful disliked it
He it is Who sent His Messenger with guidance and the way of life of The Truth to uplift it over all other ways of life even though the ones who are polytheists disliked it
O those who believed! Shall I point you to a transaction that will rescue you from a painful punishment
You believe in God and His Messenger and struggle in the way of God with your wealth and your lives. That is better for you if you had been knowing
He will forgive you your impieties and cause you to enter into Gardens beneath which rivers run, and into good dwellings in the Gardens of Eden, the winning the sublime triumph
And He gives another thing you love, help is from God and victory in the near future, so give good tidings to the ones who believe
O those who believed! Be helpers of God as Jesus son of Mary said to the disciples: Who are my helpers for God? The disciples said: We are the helpers for God. Then, a section believed of the Children of Israel and a section were ungrateful. So We confirmed those who believed against their enemies. And they became ones who are prominent
Whatever is in the heavens glorifies God and whatever is in and on the earth, The King, The Holy, The Almighty, The Wise
He it is Who raised up among the unlettered a Messenger from among them who recounts His signs to them and makes them pure and teaches them the Book and wisdom even though they had been before certainly, clearly going astray
and to others among them who join them not. And He is The Almighty, The Wise
That is the grace of God. He gives it to whom He wills. And God is Possessor of the Sublime Grace
The parable of those who were entrusted with the Torah, and, again, carries it not is as the parable of a donkey who carries writings. Miserable was the parable of a folk who denied the signs of God! And God guides not the folk, the ones who are unjust
Say: O those who became Jews! If you claimed that you are the protectors of God to the exclusion of humanity, then, covet death if you had been ones who are sincere
But they will not covet it ever because of what their hands put forward. And God is Knowing of the ones who are unjust
Say: Truly, the death that you run away from, then, it will be, truly, that which you encounter. Again, you will be returned to the One Who Knows of the unseen and the visible and He will tell you what you had been doing
O those who believed! When the formal prayer was proclaimed on the day of congregation, then, hasten about to the Remembrance of God and forsake trading. That is better for you if you had been knowing
Then, when the formal prayer had ended, disperse through the earth looking for the grace of God. And remember God frequently so that perhaps you will prosper
And when they considered a transaction or a diversion, they broke away toward it, and left thee as one who is standing up. Say: What is with God is better than any diversion or than any transaction. And God is Best of the ones who provide
When the ones who are hypocrites drew near thee. They said: We bear witness that thou art, truly, the Messenger of God. And God knows that thou art, truly, His Messenger and God bears witness that the ones who are hypocrites are ones who lie
They took their oaths to themselves as a pretext. Then, they barred from the way of God. Truly, they, how evil is what they had been doing
That is because they believed and, again, disbelieved, so a seal was set on their hearts so they understand not
When thou hast seen them, their physiques impress thee. And when they speak, thou hast heard their saying. It is as if they had been propped up timber. They assume that every Cry is against them. They are the enemy so beware of them. God took the offensive. How they are misled
And when it was said to them: Approach now. The Messenger of God asks forgiveness for you. They twist their heads and thou hadst seen them dissuading while they are ones who grow arrogant
It is the same to them whether thou hadst asked for forgiveness for them or thou hadst not asked for forgiveness for them. God will never forgive them. Truly, God guides not the folk, the ones who disobey
They are those who say: Spend not on such ones who are with the Messenger of God until they break away. And to God belongs the treasures of the heavens and the earth but the ones who are hypocrites understand not
They say: If we returned to the city, certainly, would drive out the more mighty, the ones humble spirited from it. Yet to God belongs the great glory and to His Messenger and to the ones who believe. But the ones who are hypocrites know not
O those who believed! Let not your wealth divert you nor your children from the Remembrance of God. And whoever accomplishes that, then, those, they are the ones who are losers
And spend of what We provided you before approaches death to any of you. Then, he will say: My Lord! If only Thou wouldst postpone it for a little term then, I would be charitable and be among the ones in accord with morality
But God never postpones it for a soul when its term drew near. And God is Aware of what you do
Whatever is in the heavens glorifies God and whatever is in and on the earth. His is the dominion and to Him belongs all the praise. And He is Powerful over everything
He it is Who created you: So some of you are ones who disbelieve and some of you are ones who believe. And God is Seeing of what you do
He created the heavens and the earth with The Truth and He formed you and formed your forms well. And to Him is the Homecoming
He knows what is in the heavens and the earth and He knows what you keep secret and what you speak openly. And God is Knowing of what is in the breasts
Approaches you not the tiding of those who were ungrateful before? They experienced the mischief of their affair and there is a painful punishment for them
That had been because their Messengers approach them with the clear portents, but they said: Will mortals guide us? So they were ungrateful and turned away. And God is Self-Sufficient. And God is Rich, Worthy of Praise
Those who were ungrateful claimed that they will never be raised up. Say: Yea! By my Lord, you will, certainly, be raised up. Again, you will be told of what you did. And that is easy for God
So believe in God and His Messenger, and in the Light which We caused to descend. And God is Aware of what you do
On a Day when He will amass you for the Day of Gathering, that will be the day of the mutual loss and gain, and whoever believes in God and does as one in accord with morality, He will absolve him of his evil deeds and He will cause him to enter Gardens beneath which rivers run as ones who will dwell in them forever, eternally. That will be winning the sublime triumph
But for those who were ungrateful and denied Our signs, those are the Companions of the Fire, ones who will dwell in it forever. And miserable will be the Homecoming
No affliction lit but with the permission of God. Whoever believes in God, He guides his heart. And God is Knowing of everything
And obey God and obey the Messenger. Then, if you turned away, then, it is only for Our Messenger the delivering the clear message
God, there is no god but He. And in God let the ones who believe put their trust
O those who believed! Truly, there are among your spouses and your children enemies for you, so beware of them. And if you would pardon, overlook and forgive, then, truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
Your wealth and your children are only a test. And God, with Him is a sublime compensation
So be Godfearing of God as much as you were able and hear and obey and spend. That is good for yourselves, and whoever is protected from his own stinginess, then, those, they are the ones who prosper
If you lend to God a fairer loan, He will multiply it for you and will forgive you. And God is Ready to Appreciate, Forbearing
One Who Knows the unseen and the visible, The Almighty, The Wise
O Prophet! When you divorced your wives, then, divorce them (f) after their (f) waiting periods and count their (f) waiting periods. And be Godfearing of God, your Lord. And drive them (f) not out from their (f) houses nor let them (f) go forth unless they approach a manifest indecency. These are the ordinances of God. And whoever violates the ordinances of God, then, truly, he did wrong to himself. Thou art not informed so that perhaps God will cause to evoke something after that affair
Then, when they (f) reached their (f) term, either hold them (f) back as one who is honorable or part from them (f) as one who is honorable and call to witnesses from two possessors of justice from among you and perform testimony for God. That is admonished for whomever had been believing in God and the Last Day. And he who is Godfearing of God, He will make a way out for him
And He will provide him with where he not anticipate. And whoever puts his trust in God, then, He will be enough for him. God is One Who Reaches Through His command. Surely, God assigned a measure to everything
And as for those who gave up hope of menstruation among your women, if you were in doubt, their (f) waiting period is three months and for those who have not yet menstruated. As for those (f) who are imbued with pregnancy, their (f) term is that they (f) bring forth their (f) burden. And whoever is Godfearing of God, He will make his affair with ease for him
That is the command of God which He caused to descend to you. And whoever is Godfearing of God, He will absolve him of his evil deeds and will enhance for him a compensation
Cause them (f) to dwell where you inhabited according to what you are able to afford and be not pressing them (f), putting them (f) in straits. And if they (f) had been imbued with pregnancy, then, spend on them (f) until they bring forth their (f) burden. Then, if they (f) breast feed for you, give them (f) their compensation. And each of you take counsel between you as one who is honorable. But if you make difficulties for one another, then, another would breast feed on behalf of the father
The possessor of plenty spends from his plenty. And he whose provisions were measured, he will spend out of what God gave him. And God places not a burden on any person beyond what He gave him. God will make ease after hardship
How many a town defied the command of its Lord and His Messengers, so we made a reckoning, a severe reckoning and We punished it with a horrible punishment
So it experienced the mischief of its affair and the Ultimate End of its affair had been loss
God prepared for them a severe punishment. So be Godfearing of God, O those imbued with intuition, those who believed! Surely, God caused to descend to you a Remembrance
a Messenger who recounts to you the signs of God, ones that are made manifest, that he brings out those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality from the shadows to the light. And whoever believes in God and does as one in accord with morality, He will cause him to enter into Gardens beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever, eternally. Surely, God did good with provision for him
It is God Who created the seven heavens and of the earth, a similar number like them. The command comes forth between them so that perhaps you would know that God is Powerful over everything and that God, truly, enclosed everything in His Knowledge
O Prophet! Why hast thou forbidden what God permitted to thee. Looking for the goodwill of thy spouses? And God is Forgiving, Compassionate
God imposed on you the dissolution of such of your oaths. And God is your Defender. And He is The Knowing, The Wise
And mention when the Prophet confided to one of his spouses a discourse, she, then, told it to another. God disclosed to him of it. He acquainted her with some of it and turned aside some of it. When he told her about it, she said: Who communicated this to thee? He said: The Knowing, The Aware told me
If you two repent to God, the hearts of you both will be bent towards it. And if you helped one another against him, then, truly, God, He is his Defender and Gabriel and ones in accord with morality, the ones who believe. And the angels after that are his sustainers
Perhaps if he divorced you (f), his Lord will cause in exchange for him spouses better than you (f), ones who submit (f) to One God, ones who believe (f), ones who are morally obligated (f), ones who repent, ones who worship (f), ones who are inclined to fasting (f), women previously married and virgins
O those who believed! Protect yourselves and your people from a fire whose fuel is humanity and rocks over which are angels, harsh, severe who rebel not against whatever God commanded them and they accomplish what they are commanded
O those who were ungrateful! Make not excuses this Day. You are only given recompense for what you had been doing
O those who believed! Turn to God for forgiveness remorsefully, faithfully. Perhaps your Lord will absolve you of your evil deeds and cause you to enter into Gardens beneath which rivers run. On the Day God will not cover the Prophet with shame and those who believed with him. Their light will hasten about between them and on their right. They will say: Our Lord! Fulfill for us our light and forgive us. Truly, Thou art Powerful over everything
O Prophet! Struggle against the ones who are ungrateful and the ones who are hypocrites and be thou harsh against them. And their place of shelter will be hell. And miserable will be the Homecoming
God propounded an example for those, ones who are ungrateful like the woman of Noah and the woman of Lot. They both had been beneath two servants of Our servants, ones who are in accord with morality. But they both (f) betrayed them so they avail them not against God at all. And it was said: Enter the fire along with ones who enter
And God propounded an example for those who believed: Behold the woman of Pharaoh; she said: My Lord, build for me near Thee a house in the Garden and deliver Thou me from Pharaoh and his actions and deliver me from the folk, the ones who are unjust
And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who guarded her private parts, so We breathed into it of Our Spirit and she established as true the Words of her Lord and His Books and she had been among the ones who are morally obligated
Blessed be He in whose hands is the dominion and He is Powerful over everything
He Who created death and this life that He try you as to which of you is fairer in action. And He is The Almighty, The Forgiving
Who created the seven heavens one on another? Thou hast not seen any imperfection in the creation of The Merciful. Then, return thy sight! Hast thou seen any flaw
Again, return thy sight twice again and thy sight will turn about to thee, one that is dazzled while it is weary
And, certainly, We made to appear pleasing the lower heaven with lamps and We assigned them things to stone satans. We made ready for them the punishment of the blaze
And for those who were ungrateful to their Lord is the punishment of hell. Miserable will be the Homecoming
When they were cast down into it, they would hear it sighing while it is boiling
and about to burst with rage. As often as a unit of them were cast down into it, the ones who are keepers there asked them: Approaches not a warner to you
They will say: Yea! A warner drew near us, but we denied him. And we said: God sent not down anything. You are not but in a great going astray
And they would say: If we had been hearing or are reasonable, we would not have been Companions of the Blaze
And they would acknowledge their impiety. Then, hell for the Companions of the Blaze
Truly, those who dread their Lord in the unseen, for them is forgiveness and a great compensation
Keep your saying secret or publish it, truly, He is Knowing of what is in your breasts
Would He who created not know? And He is The Subtle, The Aware
It is He who made the earth submissive to you, so walk in its tracts and eat of His provision. To Him is the rising
Were you safe from He Who is in the heaven that He will not cause the earth to swallow you up when it spins
Were you safe from He Who is in the heavens that He will not send against you a sand storm? You will know how My warner has been right
And, certainly, those who were before them denied. Then, how horrible had been My reproach
Consider they not the birds above them ones standing in ranks and closing their wings? Nothing holds them back but The Merciful. Truly, He is Seeing of everything
Who is this who would be an army for you to help you other than The Merciful? Truly, ones who are ungrateful are not but in delusion
Or who is this who will provide for you if He held back His provision? Nay! They were resolute, turning in disdain and aversion
Then is whoever walks as one who is prone on his face better guided, or he who walks without fault on a straight path
Say: It is He who caused you to grow and assigned you the ability to hear, sight, and minds. But you give little thanks
Say: It is He who made you numerous on the earth and to Him you will be assembled
And they say: When is this promise if you had been ones who are sincere
Say: The knowledge of this is only with God and I am only a clear warner
But when they saw the punishment nigh, the faces were troubled of those who were ungrateful. And it will be said to them: This is what you had been calling for
Say: Considered you if God would cause me to perish and whoever is with me or had mercy on us, who will grant protection to the ones who are ungrateful from a painful punishment
Say: He is The Merciful. We believed in Him and in Him we put our trust. Then, you will know who he is, one who is clearly gone astray
Say: Considered you? If it came to be in the morning that your water be sinking into the ground, who approaches you with assistance from water springs
n! By the pen and what they inscribe
Thou art not, by the divine blessing of thy Lord, one who is possessed
And, truly, there is for thee certainly, compensation, that which is unfailing
And, truly, thou art of sublime morals
Thou wilt perceive and they will perceive
which of you is the one who is demented
Truly, thy Lord, He is greater in knowledge of whoever went astray from His Way and He is greater in knowledge of ones who are truly guided
Then, obey not ones who deny
They wished that thou wouldst compromise with them and they would compromise with thee
But obey thou not every worthless swearer, defamer
one who goes about with slander, slandering
who delays good, a sinful, exceeder of limits
cruel and after that, ignoble
because he had been possessor of wealth and children
When Our signs are recounted to him, he said: Fables of the ancient ones
We will mark him on the snout
Truly, We tried them as We tried the Companions of the Garden when they swore an oath that they would pluck fruit, in that which is happening in the morning
They make no exception by saying if God wills
Then, a visitation from thy Lord visited it while they were ones who sleep
in that which is happening in the morning, it was like a plucked garden
And they called to one another in that which is morning
Set forth in the early morning dawn to your cultivation if you had been ones who pluck fruit
So they set out and they whisper, saying
There will, truly, not enter it today on you any needy person
And they set forth in the early morning, designing, assuming they were ones who have the power
But when they saw it, they said: We are, certainly, ones who go astray
Nay! We are ones who are deprived
The most moderate of them said: Say I not to you: Why glorify you not God
They said: Glory be to God, our Lord! Truly, we had been ones who are unjust
Then, they came forward, some with some others blaming one another
They said: O woe be to us! Truly, we had been ones who are defiant
Perhaps our Lord will cause to exchange for us better than it. Truly, we are ones who quest our Lord
Thus, this is the punishment of this present life, but the punishment of the world to come is greater, if they had been knowing
Truly, for ones who are Godfearing are Gardens of Bliss with their Lord
Will We make ones who submit to God as ones who sin
What is the matter with you? How you give judgment
Or have you a Book by which you study
that you will have in it whatever you specify
Or are there oaths from Us, ones that reach through to the Day of Resurrection providing that you will have what you yourselves give as judgment
Ask them, then, which of them will be a guarantor for that
Or have they ones they ascribe as associate with God? Then, let them approach with their ascribed associates if they had been ones who are sincere
On a Day the great calamity will be uncovered and they will be called to prostration, then, they will not be able to do so
Their sight will be that which is humbled. Abasement will come over them and they had before this been called to prostration while they were ones who are healthy
So forsake Me and whoever denies this discourse. We will draw them on gradually from where they know not
and I will grant indulgence to them. Truly, My cunning is sure
Or hast thou asked them for a compensation, so that they would be weighed down from something owed
Or have they knowledge of the unseen with them so that they write it down
So be thou patient until the determination of thy Lord and be not like the Companion of the Great Fish when he cried out, one who is suppressed by grief
If a divine blessing not followed him one after another, from His Lord he would be cast forth on the naked shore while he was one who is condemned
But his Lord elected him and made him among the ones in accord with morality
It was almost as if those who were ungrateful looked at thee sternly with their sight when they heard the Remembrance, and they say: He is one who is possessed
And it is, certainly, not but a Remembrance to the worlds
The Reality
What is The Reality
And what would cause thee to recognize what The Reality is
Thamud and Ad denied the Day of Disaster
Then, as for Thamud, they were caused to perish by a storm of thunder and lightning
As for Ad, they were caused to perish by a fierce and roaring, raging wind
It compelled against them for seven uninterrupted nights and eight days so wilt thou see the folk in it laid prostrate as if they had been uprooted fallen down date palm trees
Then, wilt thou see of them any ones who endure
Pharaoh and whoever draw near before him and the ones that are cities overthrown were ones of inequity
and they rebelled against the Messenger of their Lord, so He took them with a swelling, taking
When the waters became turbulent, we carried you in that which runs on water
that We make it an admonition for you, and attentive ears would hold onto it
And when the trumpet will be blown with one gust
and the earth and the mountains will be mounted, then, will be ground to powder in one grinding
so on that Day will have come to pass The Reality
and the heaven will be split. For on that day they will be as ones who are frail
and the angels will be at its borders. The Throne of thy Lord above them will be carried by eight on that Day
That Day you will be presented. Your private matters will not be hidden
And for him who will be given his book in his right hand he will say: Lo and behold! Recite my book
Truly, I thought that I would be one who encounters my reckoning
And he will have a well-pleasing, pleasant life
in a magnificent Garden
Its clusters, that which draws near
Eat and drink wholesomely for what you did in the past, in the days, that which have gone by
But as for him who is given his book to his left he will say: O would that I was not given my book
and that I was not informed of my reckoning
O would that my death had been my expiry
My wealth availed me not
Perished from me is my authority
It will be said: Take him and restrict him
Again, broil him in hellfire
and after that in a chain of the length of seventy cubits. So insert him in it
Truly, he had not been believing in God, The Sublime
nor did he urge food for the needy
This day he is not to have any loyal friend here
and no food, but foul pus
which none eat but ones of inequity
So I swear an oath by what you perceive
and what you perceive not
Truly, it is the saying of a generous Messenger
and not the saying of a poet. Little do you believe
Nor is it the saying of a soothsayer. Little do you recollect
It is a sending down from the Lord of the worlds
And if he fabricated against Us some sayings
truly, We would have taken him by the right hand
and, again, We would have severed his life-vein
And there is none of you who would be ones who hinder Us from him
And, truly, it is an admonition to ones who are Godfearing
And We well know that there are among you, ones who deny
And, truly, it will be a regret for ones who are ungrateful
And, truly, it is The Truth of certainty
So glorify the Name of thy Lord, The Sublime
One who supplicates asked for a punishment that will fall
on the ones who are ungrateful for which there will be no one to avert
from God, the Possessor of the Stairways of Ascent
The angels and the Spirit go up to Him on a Day whose measure had been fifty thousand years
So have thou patience with a graceful patience
Truly, they see it as distant
but We see it as near at hand
On a Day the heaven will become as molten copper
and the mountains be as wool clusters
and no loyal friend will ask a loyal friend
although they are given sight of them. One who sins would wish that he offer for ransom —from the punishment of that day—his children
or his companion wife, or his brother
or his relatives who gave him refuge
or whoever is on the earth altogether, again, if that would rescue him
No indeed. Truly, it is the furnace of hell
removing their scalps
calling whoever drew back and turned away
and gathered wealth and amassed
Truly, the human being was created fretful
When the worst afflicted him, he is impatient
And when the good afflicted him, begrudging
But the ones who formally pray
those, they are ones who continue with their formal prayers
and those who in their wealth there is a known obligation towards
the one who begs and the one who is deprived
and those who sincerely validate the Day of Judgment
And those, they are ones who are apprehensive of the punishment of their Lord
Truly, as to the punishment of their Lord, there is no one who is safe from it
Those, they are ones who guard their private parts
but not from their spouses or what their right hands possessed. Truly, they are not ones who will be reproached
But whoever was looking beyond that, those, they are ones who turn away
And those, they who in their trusts and to their compacts are ones who shepherd
And those, they who, giving their testimony, are ones who uphold
And those, they who over their formal prayers are watchful
Those will be in Gardens, ones who are honored
What is with those who were ungrateful—ones who run forward towards thee, eyes fixed in horror
to the right and the left, tied in knots
Is not every man of them desirous of being caused to enter into a Garden of Bliss
No indeed. Truly, We created them out of what they know
So I swear an oath by the Lord of the rising places and the setting places, that We certainly are ones who have power
to substitute better for them. And We are not ones who are outrun
So let them engage in idle talk and play until they encounter the Day of theirs that they are promised
the Day when they will go forth swiftly from their tombs as though they had been hurrying to a goal
with their sight, that which is humbled. Abasement will come over them. That is the Day which they had been promised
Truly, We sent Noah to his folk saying: Warn thy folk before a painful punishment approaches them
He said: O my folk! Truly, I am a clear warner to you
Worship God and be Godfearing of Him and obey me
He forgives you some of your impieties and postpones for you a term, that which is determined. Truly, when the term of God drew near, it will not be postponed if you had been but knowing
He said: My Lord! Truly, I called to my folk nighttime and daytime
but my supplication increases not but their running away
And, truly, as often as I called to them that Thou wouldst forgive them, they laid their fingertips over their ears and covered themselves with their garments. And they maintained growing arrogant as they grew arrogant
Again, truly, I called to them with openness
Again, I spoke openly to them and confided in them, keeping secret our converse
And I said: Ask for forgiveness of your Lord. Truly, He had been a Forgiver
He sends from heaven abundant rain for you
He will furnish you relief with wealth and children. And He will assign for you Gardens and will assign for you rivers
What is it with you that you hope not for dignity from God
And, surely, He created you in stages
Consider you not how God created the seven heavens, one on another
And how He made the moon in them as a light and how He made the sun as a light-giving lamp
And how God caused you to develop, bringing you forth from the earth
Again, He will cause you to return into it and bring you out in an expelling
And how God made for you the earth as a carpet
that you may tread in it ways through ravines
Noah said: My Lord! Truly, they rebelled against me. They followed such a one whose wealth and children increase him not, but in loss
And they planned a magnificent plan
And they said: You will by no means forsake your gods, nor will you forsake Wadd nor Suwa nor Yaghuth nor Yauq nor Nasr
And, truly, they are going much astray. And increase Thou not ones who are unjust but in causing them to go astray
Because of their transgressions, they were drowned and were caused to enter into a fire. And they find not for themselves any helpers other than God
And Noah said: My Lord! Allow not even one on the earth from among the ones who are ungrateful
Truly, Thou, if Thou wert to allow them, they would cause Thy servants to go astray and they will but procreate immoral ingrates
My Lord! Forgive me and ones who are my parents and whoever entered my house as one who believes—the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe and increase not the ones who are unjust, but in ruin
Say: It was revealed to me that a group of jinn listened to me. They said: Truly, we heard a wondrous Recitation
It guides to the right judgment, so we believed in it. And we will never ascribe partners with our Lord anyone
Truly, He, exalted be the grandeur of our Lord. He took no companion (f) to Himself, nor a son
and yet a foolish one among us had been saying an outrageous lie about God
But we, truly, thought that the humankind, nor the jinn would ever say a lie about God
and that there had been men of humankind who would take refuge with the masculine of the jinn, but they increased them in vileness
And they thought as you thought, that God will never raise up anyone
And we stretched towards the heaven. Then, we found it was filled with stern guards and burning flames
And we had been sitting in positions having the ability to hear. But whoever listens now will find a burning flame and watchers for him
And we were not informed whether the worst was intended for those who are on earth or whether their Lord intended for them right mindedness
There are among us, the ones in accord with morality. And there are among us other than that. We had been of ways differing from one another
And we, truly, thought that we will never be able to weaken God on the earth and we will never weaken Him by flight
So, truly, when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. And whoever believes in his Lord, he will fear neither meagerness nor vileness
And, truly, we are the ones who submit to God. Among us there are the ones who swerve from justice. And whoever submitted to God, then, those sought right mindedness
As for the ones who swerve from justice, they had been as firewood for hell
If they went straight on the way, We would have satiated them with copious water
so that We try them in it. But whoever turns aside from the Remembrance of his Lord, He will dispatch him to a rigorous punishment
Truly, the places of prostration belong to God so call not to anyone with God
And, truly, when the servant of God stood up, calling to Him, they be about to swarm upon him
Say: Truly, I call only to my Lord, and I ascribe not as partners with Him anyone
Say: Truly, I possess not the power to hurt nor to bring right mindedness for you
Say: Truly, none would grant me protection from God—not anyone! And I will never find other than Him that which is a haven
unless I be delivering messages from God, His messages. And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger, then, for him is the fire of hell, ones who will dwell in it forever, eternally
Until when they saw what they are promised, then, they will know who is weaker of ones who help and fewer in number
Say: I am not informed if what you are promised is near, or if my Lord will assign for it a space of time
He is The One Who Knows of the unseen! And He discloses not the unseen to anyone
but a Messenger with whom He was content. Then, truly, He dispatches in advance of him and from behind him, watchers
that He know that they expressed the messages of their Lord. He enclosed whatever is with them and He counted everything with numbers
O thou, the one who is wrapped
stand up during the night, but for a little part
for half of it or reduce it a little
Or increase it and chant the Quran, a good chanting
for We will cast on thee a weighty saying
Truly, one who begins in the night, is when impression is strongest and speech more upright
Truly, for thee in the daytime is a lengthy occupation
And remember thou the Name of thy Lord. And devote thyself to Him with total devotion
The Lord of the East and of the West, there is no god but He. So take Him to thyself as thy Trustee
And have thou patience with regard to what they say and abandon them with a graceful abandoning
Forsake to Me the ones who deny, those imbued with prosperity and respite them for a little
Truly, with Us are shackles and hellfire
and food which sticks in the throat and chokes and a painful punishment
On a Day when the earth will quake and the mountains, and the mountains will become a poured forth heap of sand
Truly, We sent you a Messenger, one who bears witness to you, as We sent to Pharaoh a Messenger
But Pharaoh rebelled against the Messenger so We took him a taking remorselessly
How will you fend off a day if you were ungrateful, that will make the children gray haired
The heaven will be that which is split apart from it. His promise had been one that is accomplished
Truly, this is an admonition; so let whoever willed take himself a way to his Lord
Truly, thy Lord knows that thou be standing up for nearly two thirds of the nighttime, or a half of it or a third of it along with a section of those who are with thee. And God ordains the nighttime and the daytime. He knew that you would not be able to keep count of it, so He turned towards you in forgiveness, then recite of the Quran as much as was easy. He knew that some of you are sick and others travel on the earth looking for the grace of God and others fight in the way of God. So recite of it as much as was easy. And perform the formal prayer and give the purifying alms and lend to God a fairer loan. For whatever of good you put forward for your souls, you will find the same with God. It is good and a sublime compensation. And ask God for forgiveness. Truly, God is Forgiving, Compassionate
O thou, the one who wrapped himself in a cloak
Stand up and warn
And magnify thy Lord
and purify thy garments
and abandon contamination
And reproach not others to acquire more for yourself
And for thy Lord, then, have thou patience
Then, when the horn is sounded
truly, that Day will be a difficult day
and not easy for the ones who are ungrateful
Forsake to Me whom I alone created
I assigned to him the spreading out of wealth
and children as ones who bear witness
And I made smooth for him, a making smooth
Again, he is desirous that I increase it
No indeed; he had been stubborn about Our signs
I will constrain him with a hard ascent
Truly, he deliberated and calculated
Then, perdition to him! How he calculated
Again, perdition to him! How he calculated
Again, he looked on
and, again, he frowned and scowled
Again, he drew back and grew arrogant
And he said: This is nothing but fabricated old sorcery
This is nothing but the saying of a mortal
I will scorch him in Saqar
And how will thee recognize what Saqar is
It forsakes not nor causes anything to remain
scorching the mortal
Over it there are nineteen
We assigned none but angels to be wardens of the Fire and We made the amount of them not but as a test for those who were ungrateful. So those who were given the Book are reassured and those who believed, add to their belief. And will not doubt those who were given the Book and the ones who believe. And say to those who in their hearts is a sickness and the ones who are ungrateful: What had God wanted by this example? Thus, God causes to go astray whom He wills, and He guides whom He wills. And none knows the armies of thy Lord but He. And it is not other than a reminder for the mortals
No indeed! By the moon
and the night when it drew back
and polished is the morning
Truly, it is one of the greatest of all things
as a warner to the mortals
to whomever willed among you that he go forward or remain behind
Every soul is a pledge for what it earned
but the Companions of the Right
will be in Gardens and will demand of one another
about the ones who sin
What thrust you into Saqar
They would say: We be not among the ones who formally pray
and we were not those who feed the needy
And we had been ones who engage in idle talk along with the ones who engage in idle talk
And we had been denying the Day of Judgment
until the certainty of the Hour approached us
Then, intercession will not profit them from the ones who are intercessors
Then, what is the matter with them that they are ones who turn aside from the admonition
as though they had been frightened donkeys
that ran away from a lion
Nay! Every man among them wants to be given unrolled scrolls
No indeed! Nay! They fear not the world to come
No indeed! Truly, it is an admonition
So let whoever willed, remember it
But they will not remember unless God wills. He is Worthy of God-consciousness and He is Worthy of granting The Forgiveness
I swear an oath by the Day of Resurrection
And I swear an oath by the reproachful soul
Assumes the human being that We will never gather his bones
Yea! We are ones who have power to shape his fingers again
Nay! The human being wants to act immorally in front of him
He asks: When is this Day of Resurrection
But when their sight will be astonished
and the moon will cause the earth to be swallowed
and the sun and the moon will be gathered
the human being will say on that Day: Where is a place to run away to
No indeed! There is no refuge
With thy Lord on this Day will be thy recourse
The human being will be told on that Day what he put forward and what he postponed
Nay! The human being is clear evidence against himself
And although he would cast his excuses
impel not thy tongue to hasten it
Truly, on Us is his amassing and its Recitation
But when We recited it, follow thou its Recitation
From Us after that is its clear explanation
No indeed! Nay! You love that which hastens away
and forsake the world to come
Faces on that Day will be ones that beam
ones that look towards their Lord
And faces on that day will be ones that scowl
Thou will think that against them is wreaked a crushing calamity
No indeed! When it reached the collar bones at death
and it was said: Where is one who is a wizard to save me
And he thought it to be his parting
and one leg was intertwined with the other leg
that Day he will be driving toward thy Lord
for he established not the true nor invoked blessings
and he denied and turned away
He went to his people again, going arrogantly
Closer to thee! And closer to thee
Again closer to thee! And closer to thee
Assumes the human being that he will be left aimless
Was he not a sperm-drop to be emitted in seminal fluid
Again, he had been a clot and He created him and shaped him
Then, He made of him two pairs, the male and the female
Is not that One Who Has Power over that able to give life to the dead
Approached the human being a long course of time when he will be nothing remembered
Truly, We made the human being of a mingling of seminal fluid that We may test him. So We made him hearing, seeing
Truly, We guided him on the way, whether he be one who is thankful or ungrateful
Truly, We made ready for ones who are ungrateful chains and yokes and a blaze
Truly, the pious will drink from a cup that had been a mixture of camphor
a spring where the servants of God will drink, causing it to gush forth, a great gushing
They live up to their vows and they fear a Day when the worst will be that which flies far and wide
In spite of their love for it, they feed with food one who is needy and the orphan and the prisoner of war saying
We feed you only for the Countenance of God. We want no recompense from you nor any thankfulness
Truly, we fear our Lord on a frowning, inauspicious Day
So God would protect them from worse on that day, and would make them find radiancy and joyfulness
And He will give them recompense for their enduring patiently with a Garden and silk
and ones who are reclining in it on raised benches. In it they will see neither sun nor excessive cold of the moon
And that which draws near them is its shade and clusters of grapes will be subdued, a subduing
And are passed around among them receptacles of silver and goblets that had been of crystal
crystal like silver, and that they calculated a calculating
And they are given to drink in it a cup that had been with a mixture of ginger
There is a spring in it named Salsabil
And ones who are immortal youths will go around them whom, when thou hadst seen them, thou wouldst assume them to be scattered pearls
And when thou hadst seen them, again, thou wilt have seen bliss and a great dominion
Upon them are garments of fine green silk and brocade. And they will be adorned with bracelets of silver. Their Lord will give to drink undefiled drink
Truly, this had been your recompense. What had been that which is your endeavoring
Truly, We sent down to thee the Quran, a sending down successively
So have thou patience for the determination of thy Lord and obey not any one of them, not the ones who are perverted nor the ungrateful
And remember thou the Name of thy Lord at early morning dawn and eventide
And during the night, prostrate thyself to Him and glorify Him a lengthy part of the night
Truly, these are they who love that which hastens away and they forsake a weighty day behind them
We created them and We strengthened their frame. And when We willed, We will substitute their likes with a substitution
Truly, this is an admonition. And whoever willed, he took himself on a way to his Lord
But you will it not unless God wills it. For God had been Knowing, Wise
He causes to enter whom He wills into His mercy. And the ones who are unjust, He prepared for them a painful punishment
By ones who are sent successively
by the storm and raging tempest
by that which causes vegetation to revive, unfolding
by the ones who separate a separating
by ones who cast a remembrance
as excusing or warning
truly, what you are promised will be that which falls
Then, when the stars will be obliterated
and when the heaven will be cleaved asunder
and when the mountains will be scattered
and when the time will be set for the Messengers
for which Day were these appointed
For the Day of Decision
And what would cause thee to recognize what the Day of Decision is
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
Caused We not the ancient ones to perish
Again, We will pursue the later ones
Thus, We accomplish this with the ones who sin
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
Create We you not of despicable water
Then, We made it in a secure stopping place
for a known measuring
And We measured. How bountiful are the ones who measure
Woe on that day to the ones who deny
Make We not the earth a place of drawing together
the living and the lifeless
We made on it soaring, firm mountains. We satiated you with water of the sweetest kind
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
Set out toward what you had been in it denying
Set out to the shade. It is possessor of three columns
having no shade nor availing you against the flaming
Truly, it will throw up sparks of fire like the palace
as though it was a string of saffron-colored male camels
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
This Day they will not speak for themselves
nor will they be given permission so that they make excuses
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
This is the Day of Decision; We gathered you and the ancient ones
So if you had been cunning, then, try to outwit Me
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
Truly, the ones who are Godfearing will be amidst shade and springs
and sweet fruit for which they lust
Eat and drink wholesomely for what you had been doing
Truly, We, thus, give recompense to the ones who are doers of good
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
Eat, take joy for a little. You are ones who sin
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
When it will be said: Bow down, they bow not down
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny
Then, in which discourse after this will they believe
About what demand you of one another
Of the sublime tiding
about which they are ones who are at variance in it
No indeed! Soon they will know
Again, no indeed! Soon they will know
Make We not the earth for a cradling
and the mountains as stakes
And We created not you in pairs
and We made your sleep as a rest
And We made the nighttime as a garment
And We made the daytime for you to earn a living
And We built over you seven superior ones
And We made a bright, light-giving lamp
And We caused to descend that which are clouds bringing rain, water cascading
with which We bring about grain and plants
and luxuriant Gardens
Truly, the Day of Decision would be a time appointed
a Day the trumpet is blown. Then, you approach in units
and the heaven will be let loose and will be all doors
And the mountains will be set in motion and will be as vapor
Truly, hell will be on the watch
a destination for the ones who are defiant
one who lingers in expectation in it for many years
They experience in it not any coolness nor any drink
but scalding water and filth
a suitable recompense
Truly, they had been not hoping not for a reckoning
and they denied Our signs with a denial
But We counted everything in a Book
Experience it! We will never increase you but in punishment
Truly, for the ones who are Godfearing, there is a place of security
fertile gardens and grapevines
and full breasted maidens of the same age
and a cup overflowing
No idle talk will they hear in it nor any denial
a recompense from thy Lord, a gift, a reckoning
from the Lord of the heavens and the earth and of whatever is between them, The Merciful. against Whom they possess no argument
On a Day when the Spirit and the angels will stand up ranged in rows. They will not assert themselves but he to whom the Merciful gave permission and who said what is correct
That is the Day of The Truth; so whoever willed took his Lord to himself as the destination
We warned you of a near punishment on a Day when a man will look on what his hands put forward and the ones who are ungrateful will say: O would that I had been earth dust
By the ones who tear out vehemently
by the ones who draw out a drawing out
by the ones who are swimmers, swimming
the ones who take the lead, taking the lead
by the ones who manage a command
on a Day when the quake quakes
succeeds the one that comes close behind it
hearts beating painfully on that Day
their sight, that which is humble
They say: Will we be restored to our original state
when we had been crumbled bones
They said: That is a return again of one who is a loser
Truly, there will be but one scare
That is when they would be the ones awakening
Approached thee the discourse of Moses
when his Lord cried out to him in the sanctified valley of Tuwa
Be thou gone to Pharaoh. Truly, he was defiant
And say: Wouldst thou purify thyself
And I will guide thee to thy Lord, then, thou wilt dread Him
And he caused him to see the greater sign
But Pharaoh denied and rebelled
Again, Pharaoh drew back, hastening about
Then, Pharaoh assembled them; then, proclaimed
Then, Pharaoh said: I am your lofty lord
So God took him with an exemplary punishment for the last and for the first
Truly, in that is a lesson for whoever dreads God
Is your constitution harder to create or the heaven which He built
He exalted its vault and shaped it
and He made its night dark and brought out its forenoon
And, after that, He spread out the earth
He brought out from it its water and its pasture
And the mountains He set firm
an enjoyment for you and for your flocks
When the Greater Catastrophe would draw near
on that Day the human being will recollect for what he endeavored
Hellfire will be advanced for whoever sees
As for whoever was defiant
and held this present life in greater favor
then, truly, hellfire will be the place of shelter
And as for him who feared the Station of his Lord and prohibited desire from his soul
truly, the Garden will be the place of shelter
They ask thee about the Hour. When will it berth
Then, what art thou about that thou remind of it
To thy Lord is the Utmost Boundary of it
And thou art only one who warns to such a one whoever dreads it
It will be as though a Day they see it, they linger not in expectation but an evening or a forenoon
He frowned and turned away
that the blind man drew near him
And what will cause thee to recognize so that perhaps he will purify himself
or yet recollect and a reminder profit him
But as for he who was self-complacent
then, thou hast attended to him
and not upon thee is any blame if he purifies not himself
Yet as for him who drew near to thee, coming eagerly for knowledge
and he dreads God
then, thou hast paid no heed to him
No indeed! Truly, this is an admonition
So let whoever willed, remember it
in scrolls to be held in esteem
ones that are exalted and ones that are purified
by the hands of generous writers
and ones who are kindly, generous
Perdition to the human being! How ungrateful he is
From which thing did He create him
He created him from seminal fluid then, ordained that he be
He made the way easy for him again
Again, He caused him to die and be buried
Again, when He willed, He will revive him
No indeed! The human being finishes not what He commanded him
Then, let the human being look on his food—
how We, truly, unloosed rain water with a pouring out
Again, We split the earth, a splitting
And We put forth in it grain
and grapevines and reeds
and olives and date palm trees
and dense fertile gardens
and sweet fruits and whatever grows on the earth
an enjoyment for you and your flocks
Then, when the blare drew near
that Day a man will run away from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his companion wife and his children
For every man of them on that Day will be a matter that will preoccupy him
Faces that Day will be ones that are polished
ones who are laugh and ones who rejoice at good tidings
And faces on that Day will be dust-stained
Gloom will come over them
Those, they are the ones who are ungrateful, ones who act immorally
When the sun will be darkened
and when the stars plunge down
and when the mountains will be set in motion
and when the pregnant camels are ignored
and when the savage beasts will be assembled together
and when the seas are caused to overflow
and when the souls will be mated
and when the buried infant girl will be asked
for which impiety she was slain
and when the scrolls will be unfolded
and when the heaven is stripped off
and when hellfire will be caused to burn fiercely
and when the Garden will be brought close
every soul will know to what it was prone
So no! I swear an oath by the stars that recede
by the ones that run, the setting stars
and by the night when it swarmed
and by the morning, when it sighed
truly, the Quran is a saying from a generous Messenger
possessed of strength, with the Possessor of the Throne, secure
one who is obeyed and, again, trustworthy
And your companion is not one who is possessed
And, certainly, he saw him on the clear horizon
And he is not avaricious for the unseen
nor is it the saying of the accursed Satan
So where are you going
Truly, it is not but a Remembrance to the worlds
to whoever among you willed to go straight
But you will not, unless God wills, the Lord of the worlds
When the heaven will be split apart
and when the stars will be scattered
and when the seas will be caused to gush forth
and when the graves will be scattered about
every soul would know what it put forward and what it postponed
O human being! What deluded thee as to thy generous Lord
He Who created thee, then, shaped thee in proportion
He composed thee in whichever form He willed
No indeed! Nay! You deny this way of life
And, truly, there are ones who guard over you
ones who are generous scribes
They know whatever you accomplish
Truly, the pious will be in bliss
And, truly, the ones who act immorally will be in hellfire
They will roast on the Day of Judgment
And they will not be of ones who are absent
And what will cause thee to recognize what the Day of Judgment is
Again, what will cause thee to recognize what the Day of Judgment is
It is a Day whereon a soul will not possess anything to avail another soul and the command on that Day will belong to God
Woe be to the ones who give short measure
those who when they measure against humanity obtained full measure
Yet when they wanted to measure for them, or weigh for them, they skimp
Think those not that they will be ones who are raised up
on the sublime Day
a Day when humanity will stand up for the Lord of the worlds
No indeed! Truly, the Book of the ones who act immorally is in Sijjin
And what will cause thee to recognize what Sijjin is
It is a written book
Woe on that Day to the ones who deny—
those who deny the Day of Judgment
And none denies it but every sinful, exceeder of limits
who, when Our signs are recounted to him, he said: Fables of the ancient ones
No indeed! Nay! Their hearts will be overcome with rust from what they had been earning
No indeed! They will be from their Lord on that Day ones who are alienated
Truly, again, they will be ones who roast in hellfire
Again, it will be said to them after that: This is what you had been denying
No indeed! Truly, the book of the pious is in Illiyyun
And what will cause thee to recognize what Illiyyun is
It is a written book
Bearing witness to it are the ones who are brought near to God
Truly, the pious will be in bliss
on raised benches, looking on
Thou wilt recognize on their faces the radiancy of bliss
They will be given to drink sealed over exquisite wine
Its seal will have the lingering smell of musk. So for that, then, the ones who strive, strive
And the mixture will be of Tasnim
a spring from which will drink the ones who are brought near to it
Truly, those who sinned—at those who believed—had been laughing
And when they passed by them, they would wink at one another
and when they would turn about to their people, they would turn about acting as ones who are unconcerned
And when they saw them, they would say: Truly, these are ones who go astray
They were sent as ones who guard over them
Then, on this Day, those who believed laugh at the ones who are ungrateful
seated on raised benches, they look on
Were the ones who are ungrateful not rewarded for what they had been accomplishing
When the heaven was split open
and gave ear to its Lord as it will be justly disposed to do
and when the earth stretches out
and cast what is in it and voided itself
and gave ear to its Lord as it will be justly disposed to do
O human being! Truly, thou art one who is laboring towards thy Lord laboriously and thou wilt be one who encounters Him
And as for him who will be given his book in his right hand
then, he will be made a reckoning, an easy reckoning
and will turn about to his people as one who is joyous
But for whoever will be given his book behind his back
he will call for damnation
and roast in a blaze
He had been one who is joyous with his people
Truly, he thought he would never retreat
Yea! Truly, his Lord had been seeing him
So no! I swear an oath by the twilight
and by the night and whatever it enveloped
and by the moon when it was full
that you will, truly, ride plane after plane
Then, what is for them who believe not
when the Quran was recited to them, they prostrate not themselves?‡
Nay! Those who were ungrateful deny
but God is greater in knowledge of what they amass
So give them good tidings of a painful punishment
But those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them is compensation, that which is unfailing
By the heaven possessing the constellations
by the promised Day
by ones who bear witness and ones who are witnessed
the Companions of the Ditch were slain
possessors of the fuel of the fire
above which they were ones who sit
as they were, in what they accomplish against the ones who believe, ones who bore witness
And they sought revenge on them only because they believe in God, The Almighty, The Worthy of Praise
Him to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And God is Witness over everything
Truly, those who persecuted the males, ones who believe and the females, ones who believe and again repent not after that, for them is the punishment of hell and for them is the punishment of the burning
Truly, those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them will be Gardens beneath which rivers run. That will be the Great Triumph
Truly, the seizing by force by thy Lord is severe
Truly, He causes to begin and He causes to return
And He is The Forgiving, The Loving
the Possessor of the Glorious Throne
Achiever of what He wants
Approached thee the discourse of the armies
of Pharaoh and of Thamud
Nay! Those who were ungrateful are belying
and God is One Who Encloses them from behind
Nay! It is a glorious Recitation
inscribed on the Guarded Tablet
By the heaven and the night visitor
what will cause thee to recognize what the night visitor is
It is the piercing star
Truly, every soul has one who guards it
So let the human being look on of what he was created
He was created of water, that which gushes forth
going forth from between the loins and the breast bone
Truly, He, in returning him, certainly is One Who Has Power
On a Day all secret thoughts will be tried
then, there will not be for him any strength nor one who helps
By the heaven possessing the returning
and by the earth splitting with verdure
truly, the Quran is a decisive saying
and it is not for mirth
Truly, they are strategizing a strategy
And I am strategizing a strategy
So respite the ones who are ungrateful! Grant thou them a delay for a while
Glorify the Name of thy Lord, The Lofty
Who created and shaped
and who ordained and, then, guided
and who brought out the pasture
then, made it dark colored refuse
We will make thee recite and thou wilt not forget
but what God willed. Truly, He knows the openly published and whatever is hidden
And We will make easy for thee an easing
So remind if a reminder profited them
Whoever dreads God will recollect
but the disappointed will scorn it—
even he who will roast in the great fire
again, neither dying in it nor living
He, surely, prospered, he who purified himself
and remembered the Name of his Lord and invoked blessings
Nay! You hold this present life in greater favor
yet the world to come is better, and one that endures
Truly, this is in the previous scrolls
the scrolls of Abraham and Moses
Approached thee the discourse of the Overwhelming Event
Faces on that Day will be ones that are humbled
ones that work and ones that are fatigued
roasting in a hot fire
They will be given to drink from boiling receptacles
Is it not that there is no food for them but a thorny fruit
It will not fatten nor will it avail hunger
Faces on that Day will be ones that are pleasant
ones who are well-pleased by their endeavoring
in a magnificent Garden
They will hear no babble in it
In it is a running spring
In it are exalted couches
and goblets that are set down
and cushions arrayed
and rugs, ones that are dispersed
Will they not, then, look on the camel, how it was created
And of the heaven, how it was lifted up
And the mountains, how they were hoisted up
And the earth, how it was stretched out
Then, remind for thou art only one who reminds
Thou art not over them one who is a register of their deeds
But whoever turned away and is one who is ungrateful
God will punish him with the greater punishment
Truly, to Us is their reversion
Again, truly, on Us is their reckoning
By the dawn
and the ten nights
by the even number and the odd number
and at night when it sets out
Is there not in that an oath to be sworn for a possessor of intelligence
Hast thou not considered how thy Lord accomplished with Ad
with Iram of the pillars
of which are not created the likes in the land
And with Thamud, those who hollowed out the rocks in the valley
And with Pharaoh, the possessor of the stakes
those who were defiant in the land
and made much corruption in it
So thy Lord unloosed on them a scourge of punishment
Truly, thy Lord is, surely, on the watch
Then, as for the human being, when his Lord tested him and honored him and lauded him, he says: My Lord honored me
But whenever He tested him and constricted his provision for him, he says: My Lord despised me
No indeed! Nay! You honor not the orphan
and you encouraged not one another about food for the needy
and you consume the inheritance, a greedy consuming
and you love wealth with an ardent cherishing
No indeed! When the earth will be ground to powder, ground to powder, ground to powder
and thy Lord will draw near, and the angels, ranged in rows
on the Day hell is brought about. On that Day the human being will recollect. And how will the reminder be for him
He will say: O would that I had put forward from this life for the world to come
Then, on that Day, He will punish no one the like of His punishment
And no one will bind as His restraints
O soul, one that is at peace
Return to thy Lord, one that is well-pleasing, well-pleased
Enter thou among My servants
and thou enter My Garden
I swear an oath by this land
thou art allowed in this land
and by ones who are your parents and what is procreated
truly, We created the human being in trouble
Assumes he that none has power over him
He says: I have caused abundant wealth to perish
Assumes he that none sees him
Make we not two eyes for him
and a tongue and two lips
and guided him to the two open highways
Yet he rushed not onto the steep ascent
What will cause thee to recognize what the steep ascent is
It is the liberating of a bondsperson
or feeding on a day possessing famine
an orphan, possessor of kinship
or a needy, possessor of misery
Again, it had been among those who believed and counseled one another to having patience and counseled one another to clemency
Those will be the Companions of the Right
But they who were ungrateful for Our signs they will be the Companions of the Left
and over them will be fire, that which is closing in
By the sun and its forenoon
and by the moon when it related to it
and by the daytime when it displayed it
and by the nighttime when it overcomes it
and by the heaven and what built it
and by the earth and what widened it
and by the soul and what shaped it
and, then, inspired it to its acting immorally and God-consciousness
he who made it pure prospered
Surely, is frustrated whoever seduced it
Thamud denied because of their overboldness
When the disappointed among them were aroused
and the Messenger of God said to them: Allow watering to the she-camel of God
Then, they denied him; then, they crippled her. So their Lord doomed them for their impiety
Then, He leveled them. And He fears not its Ultimate End
By the nighttime when it overcomes
by the daytime when it self-disclosed
by Him Who created the male and the female
truly, your endeavoring is diverse
As for him who gave and was Godfearing
and established the fairer as true
We will make easy for him the easing
And as for him who was a miser and was self-sufficient
and denied the fairer
We will make falling into difficulty easy for him
And his wealth will not avail him when he succumbed
Truly, guidance is from Us
and, truly, to Us belongs the last and the first
I warned you of a fire that blazes fiercely
It roasts none but the vile
who denied and turned away
But the devout will be caused to turn aside from it
He who gives of his wealth to purify himself
and with him there is none for which recompense is expected to be given for divine blessing
but looking for the Countenance of his Lord, The Lofty
he will be well-pleased
By the forenoon
and by the night when it brooded
thy Lord deserted thee not, nor is He in hatred of thee
Truly, the last will be better for thee than the first
And thy Lord will give to thee. Then, thou wilt be well-pleased
Found He thee not an orphan and He gave thee refuge
And found He thee one who goes astray, then, He guided thee
And found He thee one who wants, then, He enriched thee
So as for the orphan, oppress him not
And as for one who begs, scold him not
And as for the divine blessing of thy Lord, divulge it
Expand We not thy breast
and lifted from thee the heavy loaded burden
that weighed heavily on thy back
Exalted We not thy remembrance
So, truly, with hardship, ease
Truly, with hardship, ease
When thou hadst finished thy duties, then, work on supplication
and quest thy Lord
By the fig and the olive
and by Mount Sinai
and by this trustworthy land
truly, We have created the human being of the fairer symmetry
Again, We returned him to the lowest of the low
But those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, for them is compensation, that which is unfailing
What will cause thee to deny the Judgment after that
Is not God The Most Just of ones who judge
Recite in the Name of thy Lord Who created
He created the human being from a clot
Recite: Thy Lord is the Most Generous
He Who taught by the pen
He taught the human being what he knows not
No indeed! The human being is, truly, defiant
He considered himself self-sufficient
Truly, to thy Lord is the returning
Hast thou thyself considered he who prohibits
a servant when he invoked blessings
Hast thou considered if he had been on guidance
or commanded God-consciousness
Hast thou considered if he denied and turned away
Knows he not that God sees
No indeed! Truly, if he refrains himself not, We will, surely, lay hold of him by the forelock
a lying, inequitable forelock
And let him call to his conclave
We will call to the guards of hell
No indeed! Truly, obey thou him not but prostrate thyself to God and be near to Him.‡
Truly, We caused it to descend on the night of power
And what will cause thee to recognize what is the night of power
The night of power is better than a thousand months
The angels come forth and the Spirit during it with their Lord’s permission, with every command
Peace it is until the time of the rising dawn
Not would those who were ungrateful from among the People of the Book, nor the ones who are polytheists to be ones who set aside their beliefs until the clear portent approaches them
A Messenger from God, who recounts to them purified scrolls
wherein are truth-loving Books
Split up not among themselves those to whom the Book was given until after the clear portent drew near them
They were commanded but to worship God as ones who are sincere and devoted in the way of life to Him, as monotheists and they perform the formal prayer and they give the purifying alms. That is the truth-loving way of life
Truly, those who were ungrateful among the People of the Book and the ones who are polytheists will be in the fire of hell, ones who will dwell in it forever. Those are the worst of creatures
But those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, those are the best of creatures
Their recompense is with their Lord—Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers run, ones who will dwell in them forever, eternally. God was well-pleased with them and they were well-pleased with Him. That is for him who dreaded his Lord
When the earth will be convulsed with a convulsion
and the earth brought out its ladings
and the human being said: What is with it
On that Day it will divulge its news
for your Lord revealed it
On that Day humanity will issue, separately, that they may be caused to see their actions
And whoever does the weight of an atom of good will see it
And whoever does the weight of an atom of the worst will see it
By the chargers, panting
by ones who strike a fire, striking fire
by the ones who are raiders in the morning
then, they plowed it to a trail of dust
and they penetrated the center with it, a multitude
Truly, the human being is unthankful to his Lord
And, truly, he is a witness to that
And he is more severe in the cherishing of good
Knows he not that when all that is in the graves will be scattered about
and will be shown forth what is in the breasts
Truly, their Lord on that Day is Aware of them
The Disaster
What is the Disaster
And what will cause thee to recognize what the Disaster is
On a Day humanity will be like dispersed moths
and the mountains will be like plucked wool clusters
Then, for him whose balance was heavy will be
one whose life is pleasant, well-pleasing
But he whose balance was made light
his abode of rest will be the pit
What will cause thee to recognize what it is
It is a hot fire
Rivalry diverted you
until you stopped by the cemetery
No indeed! You will know
Again, no indeed! You will know
No indeed! If you will know with the knowledge of certainty
you will, certainly, see hellfire
Again, you will see it with the eye of certainty
Again, you will, certainly, be asked on that day about the bliss
By time through the ages
truly, the human being is, surely, in a loss
but those who believed and did as the ones in accord with morality, and counseled one another to The Truth, and counseled one another to having patience
Woe to every slandering backbiter
who gathered wealth and counted it over and over
He assumes that his wealth made him immortal
No indeed! He will be cast forth into the Crusher
And what will cause thee to recognize what the Crusher is
It is the fire of God, that which is kindled eternally
that peruses the minds
that which will be closing in on them
with its pillars, ones that are outstretched
Hast thou not considered what thy Lord accomplished with the Companions of the Elephant
Makes He not their cunning leading to nothing
And He sent upon them flocks of birds
throwing at them rocks of baked clay
Then, made He them like ones who are consumed by stalks of husked grain
For the solidarity of the Quraysh
their solidarity is the winter and the summer travel
Let them worship the Lord of this House
Who fed them against hunger and secured them against fear
Hadst thou considered one who denies this way of life
And that is he who drives away with force the orphan
and urges not to give food to the needy
So woe to ones who formally pray
ones who are inattentive to their formal prayers
those who make display
yet they repulse giving the assistance
Truly, We gave thee the abundance
So invoke blessings for thy Lord and make sacrifice
Truly, the one who detests thee, he is the one who is cut off
Say: O ones who are ungrateful
I worship not what you worship
and you are not ones who worship what I worship
And I am not one who worships what you worshipped
And you are not ones who worship what I worship
For you is your way of life, and for me is my way of life
When the help of God drew near and the victory
and thou hadst seen humanity entering into the way of life of God in units
then, glorify the praise of thy Lord and ask for His forgiveness. Truly, He had been ever The Accepter of Repentance
Ruined were the hands of Abu Lahab and he was ruined
His wealth availed him not nor whatever he earned
He will roast in a fire, possessing flames
and his woman, the carrier of firewood
around her long neck is a rope of palm fibers
Say: He is God, One
God, the Everlasting Refuge
He procreated not nor was He procreated
and there be not anything comparable with Him
Say: I take refuge with the Lord of Daybreak
from the worst of things that He created
and from the worst of the darkness of the night when the dark intensified
and from the worst of the women who practice magic, blowing on the knots
and from the worst of one who is jealous when jealous
Say: I take refuge with the Lord of humanity
King of humanity
God of humanity
from the worst of the sneaking whisperer of evil
who whispers evil in the breasts of humanity
from among the genie and humanity
