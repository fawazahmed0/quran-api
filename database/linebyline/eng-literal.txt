Those are on a guidance from their Lord and those are the successful/winners
That those who disbelieved, (it is) equal/alike on (to) them, had you warned them , or you did not warn them, (notice) they do not believe
God sealed/stamped on their hearts/minds and on their hearing and on their eye sights/understanding a cover and for them (is) a great torture
And from the people who say: "We believed by God and with the Day the Last/ Resurrection Day." And they are not with believing
They deceive God, and those who believed, and they do not deceive except themselves, and they do not feel/know/sense
In their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease, so God increased them sickness/disease, and for them (is a) painful torture because (of) what they were lying/denying/falsifying
And if (it was) said to them: "Do not corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth." They said: "But we are correcting/repairing
Is it not that they truly are, they are the corrupting and but they do not feel/know/sense

Those are those who bought/volunteered the misguidance with the guidance, so their commercial trade/buying and selling did not profit/gain, and they were not guided
Their example (is) as the one who ignited a fire, so when it lit/illuminated what (is) around/surrounding him, God took/went away with their light, and left them in darknesses, they do not see/understand

Or as a rain from the sky, in it (is) darknesses and thunder and lightning, they put their fingers intheir ears from the thunderous noise , fearing the death , and God (is) with the disbelievers surrounding/enveloping
The lightning almost snatches their eye sights , whenever (it) lit for them they walked in it, and if (it) darkened on them they stood and if God willed/wanted, He would have gone/taken away with their hearing/sense of hearing , and their sights/understanding , that God (is) on every thing capable/powerful
You, you the people worship your Lord who created you, and those from before you, maybe/perhaps you fear and obey (God)
Who made/created for you the earth/Planet Earth a spread , and the sky/space a structure and descended from the sky water, so He brought out with it from the fruits a provision for you, so do not make/create to God equals (idols) and you are knowing
And if you were in doubt/suspicion from what We descended on Our worshipper/slave , so come/bring with a chapter from its similar/equal/alike to it, and call your witnesses/testifiers from other than God, if you were truthful
So if you do not make/do and you will never make/do, so fear the fire, that/which its fuel (is) the people and the stones, (it) was/is prepared to the disbelievers
And announce good news (to) those who believe and did/made the correct/righteous deeds, that to them (are) treed gardens the rivers flow from beneath it.

And they were given with it similar , and for them in it (are) purified spouses and they are in it immortally/eternally
That God does not (feel) shame that (He) gives/strikes an example , (of) any a mosquito (and) so what (is) above it, so but those who believed, so they know that it (is) the truth from their Lord, and but those who disbelieved, so they say: "What did God want/intend with that (as) an example/proverb?" He misguides with it many, and He guides with it many, and He does not misguide with it except the debauchers
Those who break God`s promise/contract (their promise to God) from after its affirmation , and they cut/sever what God ordered with it that (it) be reached/connected , and they corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth, those they are the losers
How do you disbelieve with God and you were deads, so He revived you, then He makes you die, then He revives you , then to Him you are being returned
He (is), who created for you what (is) in the land/earth/Planet Earth all together/wholly , then He tended to the sky/space, so He straightened them (into) seven skies/space(s), and He is with every thing knowledgeable
And when your Lord said to the angels: "That I am making/creating/putting in the earth a caliph/successor/leader ." They said: "Do you make/create/put in it, who corrupts in it and sheds the blood, and we praise/glorify with Your praise and we (continue to admit Your) holiness/sanctity to You." He said: "I know what you do not know
And He taught Adam the names, all of them, then He displayed/exhibited/showed them on (to) the angels, so He said: "Inform Me with (the) names (of) those, if you were truthful
They said: "Your praise/glory , no knowledge to us except what You taught us , that You are the knowledgeable, the wise/judicious
He said: "You, Adam, inform them with their names." so when he informed them with their names, He (God) said: "Did I not say to you, that I know the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s unseen and I know what you show, and what you were hiding/concealing
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam." So they prostrated except Satan , he refused/hated and became arrogant, and he was from the disbelievers
And We said: "You Adam, reside/inhabit you and your wife/spouse the Paradise/treed garden, and you (B) eat from it easily/comfortably where/when you (B) wanted, and do not approach/near (B) this the tree, so you (B) become from the unjust/oppressors
So the devil made them (B) slip/fall/sin from it, so he brought them (B) out from what they were (B) in it, and We said: "Descend/decline some of you to some (are) an enemy and for you in the earth/Planet Earth (is) settlement and long life/enjoyment to a time
So Adam received from his Lord words/expressions, so (He) forgave on him, that He is, He is the forgiver , the most merciful
We said: "Drop/decline from it, all together , so when a guidance from Me comes to you, so who followed My guidance, so no fear/fright on them and nor they be sad/grieving

Those who suppose/think that they are meeting their lord and that they are to Him returning

And fear a day/time, no self rewards/substitutes from a self a thing, and no mediation (is to) be accepted/received from it, and no ransom/redemption (is to) be taken from it, and nor they be given victory
And when/where We saved/rescued you, from Pharaoh`s family, they burden/impose upon you (with) the torture`s evil (worst), they slaughter your sons and they shame your women, and in that (is) a great test from your Lord
And when/where We separated with you the sea , so We saved/rescued you, and We drowned/sunk Pharaoh`s people and (while) you are looking/watching
And when/where We promised Moses forty nights, then you took the calf from after him, and you are unjust/oppressive
Then We forgave on you from after that, maybe you thank/be grateful
And when We gave Moses The Book and the Separator of Right and Wrong , maybe you (will) be guided
And when Moses said to his nation: "You my nation, that you caused injustice to yourselves, because (of) your taking the calf (to worship), so repent to your creator , so fight/kill yourselves, that is best for you at your creator ." So, He forgave on you, that He is the forgiver , the most merciful
And when you said: "You, Moses, we will never believe to you until we see God openly , so the death/cry of torture took/punished you, and you are looking/watching
Then We revived/resurrected you from after your death/lifelessness , maybe you thank/be grateful
And We overshadowed on you the clouds , and We descended on you the mana (sweet gluey substance) and the quails/amusement . Eat from (the) goodness (of) what We provided for you , and they did not cause injustice to Us, and but they were (to) themselves causing injustice
And when We said: "Enter this village/urban city, so eat from it where/when you willed/wanted easily/comfortably and enter the door/entrance prostrating and say humility/forgiveness (be humble) ,We (will) forgive for you your sins/wrongs/mistakes , and We will increase the good doers
Those who caused injustice/oppression , so (they) exchanged/replaced a saying other than what was said to them, so We descended on those who caused injustice/oppression, filth/torture from the sky/space with what they were debauching
And when Moses asked for drink for his nation, so We said: "Hit/move/palpitate with your stick/cane the stone, so twelve water springs/wells burst/flowed from it, each people had known their drinking place. Eat and drink from God`s provision and do not corrupt in the Earth/land corrupting/disordering
And when you said: "You Moses, (we) will never be patient on one food, so call for us your lord (to) bring out for us from what the Earth/land sprouts/grows from its vegetables , and its long cucumber , and its legumes , and its lentils and its onions ." He said: "Do you exchange/substitute what it isnearer/weaker/poorer with what it is good/best ? Descend/enter (to the) city/border/region/Egypt , so for you (there is) what you asked/demanded." And it is imposed/forced on them the humiliation/disgrace and the poverty/ oppression and they returned/resided with anger from God, (that is) because they were disbelieving with God`s signs/verses/evidences , and (they) kill the prophets without the right , that (is) because (of) what they disobeyed, and they were transgressing/violating
That those who believed and those who repented/guided/Jews , and the Christians and the Sabians/converts , who believed with God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so for them their reward (is) at their lord, and no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving
And when We took your promise/covenant , and We raised above you the mountain , take/receive what We gave you with strength/power , and mention/remember what (is) in it, maybe you fear and obey (God)
Then you turned away from after that, so where it not for God`s grace/favour on you, and His mercy , you would have been from the losers
And you had known those who transgressed/violated from you in the Saturday/Sabbath, so We said to them: "Be lowly/ousted out monkeys/apes
So We made it (a) severe exemplary punishment for what (is) between its hands and what (is) behind it, and (an) advice/warning , to the fearing and obeying
And when Moses said to his nation: "That God orders/commands you that you slaughter a cow." They said: "Do you take us mockingly ?" He said: "I seek protection by God that I be from the lowly/ignorant
They said: "Call for us your Lord He clarifies for us what it is." He (Moses) said: "That He says that it is a cow not (an) old aged animal , and nor first born/virgin , middle aged between that, so make/do what you are ordered/commanded
They said: "Call for us your Lord, (to) clarify for us what its colour (is)." He said: "That He says, that it truly is a cow, yellowish , clear pure bright yellow its colour, it delights the lookers
They said: "Call for us your Lord He clarifies to us what it is, that the cows looked alike/resembled (each other) , on (to) us and that we are if God willed/wanted guided (E)
He said: "That He says that it is a cow not manipulated/eased , it ploughs the earth, and does not water/irrigate the agricultural land/plants flawless, no marks/different colours in it." They said: "Now, you came with the truth/fact " So they slaughtered it , and they were not about to make/do (it)
And when you (P) killed a self, so you repelled (accusations amongst yourselves) in it, and God (is) bringing out what you were hiding/concealing
So We said: "Mix/strike it with some of it." Like that God revives/makes alive the deads and He shows you His signs/verses/examples , maybe you reason/understand/comprehend
Then your hearts/minds became cruel/merciless from after that, so it is as the stones or stronger cruelty/mercilessness, and that from the stones (E) what the rivers bursts/flows from it and that from it (E) what splits/cracks so the water comes out of it, and that from it (E) what drops/reduces from God`s fear, andGod (is) not with ignoring/disregarding from what you are doing/making
Do you covet that they believe to you, and (there) had been a group/party from them (that) was hearing God`s speech/conversation (words), then they alter/distort/change it from after what they understood/comprehended it , and they know
And if they met those who believed, they said: "We believed." And if some of them (were) together to (with) some, they said: "Do you tell/inform them with what God taught on (to) you? To argue with you with it at your Lord." Do you not reason/understand
Are they not knowing that God knows what they keep secret and what they declare/publicize
And from them (are) illiterates/belonging to a nation they do not know The Book except (as) wishes/desires/lies and that they are except assuming/ supposing
So grief/distress/woe (expression) to those who write The Book with their hands then they say: "That (it is) from at God." To buy/volunteer with it a small price, so grief/distress/woe (expression) to them from what their hands wrote , and grief/distress/woe (expression) to them from what they gather/acquire
And they said: "The fire will never touch us except counted/numbered days/times." Say: "Did you take at God a promise/contract , so God will not break His promise/contract , or are you saying on God what you do not know
Yes/certainly , who gathered/earned a sin/crime, and his sin/mistake surrounded/enveloped with him so those (are) the fire`s owners/company, they are in it immortally/eternally
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, those are the Paradise`s owners/company, they are in it immortally/eternally
And when We took Israel`s sons` and daughters` promise/covenant, "Do not worship except God, and with the parents a goodness and of the relations/near , and the orphans and the poorest of the poor/poor oppressed , and say to the people goodness, and keep up/take care of the prayers and give/bring the charity/purification." Then you turned away except (a) few from you and you are objecting/opposing
And when We took your promise/covenant. "Do not shed your blood and do not bring yourselves out from your homes/countries , then you acknowledged/accepted and you (are) witnessing/testifying
Then you are those who you kill yourselves and you force out a group/part from you, from their homes/countries, you cooperate/support on (against) them with the sin/crime and the transgression/injustice/aggression and if they come to you captives/prisoners you ransom them , and it is forbidden on you bringing/forcing them out. Do you believe with some/part (of) The Book and you disbelieve with some/part? So but (what is the) reward/reimbursement (of) who does that from you, except shame/scandal/disgrace in the life the present/worldly life (on) and the Resurrection Day they be returned to the torture`s strongest (severest), and God (is) not with ignoring/disregarding on what you make/do
Those are these who bought/volunteered the life the present/worldly life with the end (other life), so the torture is not to be lightened/reduced on them, and nor they be given victory
And We had given/brought Moses The Book and We sent from after him with the messengers, and Wegave/brought Jesus Mary`s son, the evidences and We supported him with the Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Spirit , so if whenever a messenger came to you with what yourselves do not desire you become arrogant, so a group you denied and a group you kill
And they said: "Our hearts/minds (are) covered/uncomprehending ." But God cursed them with their disbelief, so little/few (are) what they believe
And when a Book came to them from at God, confirming to what (is) with them and they were from before judging/asking on those who disbelieved, so when what they knew came to them, they disbelieved with it, so God`s curse/torture (is) on the disbelievers
How bad (it is what), they bought/volunteered with it themselves, that they disbelieve with what God descended, corrupting/transgressing that God descends from His grace/favour on whom He wants/wills from His worshippers/slaves, so they returned/resided with anger on anger, and to the disbelievers (is) a humiliating torture
And if it was/is said to them: "Believe with what God descended." They said: "We believe with what is descended on us and they disbelieve with what is behind/beyond it, and it is the truth confirming to what (is) with them." Say: "So why do you kill God`s prophets from before, if you were believing
And Moses had (E) come to you with the evidences, then you took/received the calf from after him, and you are unjust/oppressive
And when We took your promise/covenant and We raised the mountain above/over you. Take/receive what We brought (to) you with a strength/power and hear/listen. They said: "We heard and we disobeyed." And they were made to drink/mix/saturate in their hearts/minds the calf with their disbelief. Say: "How bad (is what) your faith/belief orders/commands you with it, if you were believing
Say: "If the home (of) the last (other life) was for you, at God clearly/purely (exclusively) from other than the people, so wish/desire the death/lifelessness if you were truthful
And they will never/not wish/desire it, never, because (of) what their hands advanced , and God (is) knowledgeable with the unjust
And you will find them (E) the people most holding stingily and desiring strongly on (a) life/existence and from those who shared/made partners with God, any of them wishes/loves if he be granted long life (a) thousand years, and it is not with moving/hurriedly pushing him from the torture, that he be granted long life ,and God (is) seeing/understanding with what they make/do/work
Say: "Who was an enemy to Gabriel , so that he descended it on your heart/mind with God`s permission, confirming to what (is) between his hands, and (a) guidance and a good news to the believers
Who was an enemy to God, and His angels, and His messengers, and Gabriel , and Michael , so then God (is) an enemy to the disbelievers
And We had descended to you evidences signs/verses/evidences, and none disbelieves with it except the debauchers
Is (it) whenever they promised a promise/contract a group of them broke it , but most of them do notbelieve
And when a messenger came to them from at God confirming to what (is) with them, a group from those who were given The Book , discarded/rejected God`s Book behind their backs, as if they do not know
And they followed what the devils read/recite on Soliman`s kingdom/ownership and Soliman did not disbelieve, and but the devils disbelieved. They teach the people the magic/sorcery and what was descended on the two kings/angels Harut and Marutat Babylon, and they (B) do not teach from anyone until they (B) say: "But we are a test , so do not disbelieve". So they learn from them (B) what they separate with it between the human/man and his wife, and they are not with harming with it from anyone except with God`s permission. And they learn what harms them and does not benefit them, and they had known for who (E) bought it, (there is) no share of blessing/fortune for him in the end (other life), and how bad (E) (is) what they bought/volunteered with it themselves, if they were knowing
And if they had believed and feared and obeyed, then a reward (E) from at God, (is) better if they were knowing
You, you those who believed, do not say: "Observe us ." And say: "Give us time And hear/listen, and to the disbelievers (is) a painful torture
Those who disbelieved from the people of The Book and nor the sharing (with God) , they do not wish/love that a goodness be descended on you from your Lord, and God singles out/specializes with His mercy whom He wills/wants, and God (is) of the grace/favour , the great
We do not erase/nullify/abolish from a sign/verse/evidence , or We make it forgotten, (except that) We come/bring with better than it, or similar/equal/alike to it. Do you not know that God (is) on every thing powerful/capable
Do you not know that for God (for) Him (is) the ownership/kingdom (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and (there is) none for you from other than God from (a) guardian and nor (a) victorior
Or do you want that you question/ask your messenger, as Moses was questioned/asked from before, and who exchanges/replaces/substitutes the disbelief with the belief, so he had misguided the way`s/road`s straightness/equality
Many from The Book`s people wished/loved if they return you (back) from after your belief (to) disbelievers, envying/jealousy from at themselves from after what was clarified to them (from) the truth , so forgive/pardon and forgive/pardon until God comes with His order/command , that God (is) on every thing powerful/capable
And keep up the prayers and give the charity/purification and what you advance to yourselves from goodness, you find it at God, that God (is) with what you make/do seeing/understanding
And they said: "Will never enter the Paradise except who was Jewish or Christian ." Those are their wishes/desires. Say: "Give me your proof/evidence if you were truthful
Yes/certainly, who submitted/surrendered his faith/direction to God and he is (a) good doer, so for him his reward (is) at his Lord and no fear/fright on them and nor they be saddened/grieving
And the Jews said: "The Christians are not on a thing." And the Christians said: "The Jews are not on a thing." And they read/recite The Book , like that those who do not know said similar (to) their saying so God judges between them (in) the Resurrection Day, in what they were in it differing/disagreeing
And who is more unjust/oppressive from (than) who prevented (in) God`s mosques that His name be mentioned/remembered in it, and strived/hastened in its destruction/spoilage . Those, it was not for them that they enter it except afraid/frightened. For them in the present world (is) shame/disgrace and for them in the end (other life) (is a) great torture
And to God the sunrise/east and the sunset/west, so wherever you turn, so there (is) God`s face/direction, that God is rich/extended , knowledgeable
And they said: "God took/received a child (son) His praise/glory, but to Him what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, each/all for him (are) obeying humbly
Creating marvelously without precedent the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and if He ordered/accomplished a matter/affair , so but he says to it: "Be." So it will become
And those who do not know said: "If only God converses/speaks (to) us or a sign/verse/evidence comes to us." Like that those from before them said alike/similar/equal (to) their saying. Their hearts/minds resembled (each other), We had clarified/explained the signs/verses/evidences to a nation being sure/certain
That We sent you with the truth (as) an announcer of good news and a warner/giver of notice, and you are not (to) be asked/questioned about the roaring fire`s/Hell`s owners/company
And the Jews and nor the Christians will not/never accept/approve about you until you follow their religion/faith . Say: "That God`s guidance, it is the guidance." And if (E) you followed their self attractions for desires after what came to you from the knowledge, (there is) none for you from (other than) God from a guardian and nor (a) victorior
Those who We brought to them The Book they read/recite it its correct/true reading/recitation, those believe with it and who disbelieves with it so those (are) the losers
You Israel`s sons and daughters, remember My blessing , that I blessed on you, and that I preferred/favoured you over the creations all together/(universes)
And fear a day/time, no self rewards/reimburses (removes) from a self a thing, and no redemption/ransom (is) to be accepted/received from it, and nor mediation benefits it, and nor they be given victory/aid
And when Abraham`s Lord tested (him) with words/expressions, so He completed them, (He) said: "That I am making you to the people a leader/example ." He (Abraham) said: "And from my descendants?" He said: "The unjust/oppressors do not receive/obtain My promise
And when We put The House (as) a reward/replacement/compensation to the people, and (a) safety/security, and they took from Abraham`s place a prayer place , and We entrusted/recommended to Abraham and Ishmael: "That purify/clean/wash (B) My House for the circlers/walkers around , and the devoting/dedicating , and the bowing , the prostrating
And when Abraham said: "My Lord , make this a safe/secure country/place , and provide for its people from the fruits, who believed from them, by God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day." He said: "And who disbelieved, so I give him long life/make him enjoy a little , then I force him to the fire`s torture, and how bad (is) the end/destination
And when Abraham raises the foundations/bases from The House , and Ishmael: "Our Lord accept from us, that you are the hearing/listening the knowledgeable
Our Lord and make us two Moslems to you, and from our descendants, a nation submitting/surrendering/Moslems to you, and show us our rituals/methods of worship and forgive on us, that you are the forgiver, the most merciful
Our Lord, and send in them a messenger from them (who) reads/recites on (to) them Your verses/evidences and He teaches/instructs them The Book , and the wisdom , and purifies them , that You are the glorious/mighty the wise/ judicious
And who shuns/turns away from Abraham`s religion/faith except who made himself ignorant/foolish ?And We had chosen/purified him in the present world, and that he is in the end (other life) from (E) the correct/righteous
When his Lord said to him: "Submit/surrender/be Moslem ." He said: "I submitted/surrendered/became Moslem to the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
And Abraham directed/commanded with it his sons and daughters , and Jacob: "You my sons and daughters, that God chose/purified for you the religion, so do not die (E) except and you are submitters/surrenderers/Moslems
Or were you witnesses when the death came to Jacob, when he said to his sons and daughters :"What (do) you worship from after me?" They said: "We worship your God and your fathers/forefathers Abraham`s and Ishmael`s and Issac`s God, one God and we are to Him submitters/surrenderers/Moslems
That is a nation had past for it what it earned/acquired and for you what you earned/acquired and you are not to (be) asked/questioned about what they were doing/making
And they said: "Be Jews or Christians, you will be guided." Say: "But Abraham`s religion/faith submitter/unifier of God , and he was not from the sharers (with God)
Say: "We believed with God and what was descended to us and what was descended to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Issac, and Jacob, and the grandchildren/branches/Jewish tribes , and what was given to Moses, and Jesus , and what was given to the prophets from their Lord, we do not separate/distinguish between anyone from them, and we are to Him submitters/surrenderers/Moslems
So if they believed with a similar/equal/alike (to) what you believed with (it), so they had been guided, and if they turned away, so but they are in defiance/disobedience , so God will suffice (protect) you against them , and He (is) the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable
God`s faith/immersion , and who (is) better than God`s faith/immersion , and we are to Him worshipping
Say: "Do you argue with us in God, and He is our Lord and your Lord, and for us (are) our deeds ,and for you your deeds , and we are for Him faithful/loyal
Or (do) you say that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Issac, and Jacob, and the grandchildren/branches/Jewish tribes were Jews or Christians? Say: "Are you more knowing or God? And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who hid/concealed a testimony at (with) him (self) from God, and God is not ignoring about what you make/do
That (is) a nation had passed/expired for it what it earned/acquired , and for you what you earned/acquired , and you are not (to) be asked/questioned about what they were making/doing

So they drank from it, except a few from them, so when he crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: "No power/ability/energy to us today with Goliath and his soldiers/warriors." Those who assume/suppose that they are meeting God said: "How many (times) from a little/small group defeated a group (of) many with God`s will?" And God (is) with the patient/enduring
And when they emerged/appeared to Goliath and his soldiers/warriors, they said: "Our Lord, pour on us patience and make our feet firm , and give us victory/aid on (over) the nation, the disbelieving
So they defeated them with God`s will, and David killed Goliath , and God gave him the ownership/kingdom and the wisdom and He taught/instructed him from what He wills/wants, and (if it) was not for God`s pushing the people, some/part of them with some/part (with each other), the earth/Planet Earth would have been corrupted/disordered , and but God (is owner) of grace/favour/blessing over the creations altogether/(universes)
Those are God`s signs/verses/evidences, We read/recite it on (to) you with the truth , and that you are from the messengers
Those are the messengers, We preferred/favoured/blessed some/part of them over some/part, from them who spoke/conversed/talked (with) God, and He rose some/part of them steps/stages/degrees. And We gave Jesus ,Mary`s son, the evidences, and We supported him with the Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Spirit , and if God wanted/willed, those from after them would not (have) fought/killed each other from after the evidences came to them, and but they differed/disagreed/disputed, so from them who believed, and from them who disbelieved, and if God willed/wanted, they would not (have) fought/killed each other, and but God does/makes what Hewants/wills/intends
You, you those who believed, spend from what We provided for you from before that a day comes, (there is) no selling/trading in it and nor faithful/close friendship , and nor mediation, and the disbelievers, they are the unjust/oppressive
God, no God except He, the live/alive, the of no beginning and self sufficient , no drowsiness/slumber ,and nor sleep takes Him, for Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth. Who (is) that who mediates at Him, except with His permission ? He knows what (is) between their hands and what (is) behind them, and they do not comprehend/envelope with a thing from His knowledge, except with what He wills/wants. His throne/knowledge extended/contained/enriched the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and (it) does not tire/burden Him their (B)`s protection/observation , and He (is) the high/dignified , the great
No compulsion/force in the religion, the correct/right had been clarified , from the misguidance/failure , so who disbelieves with the devil/every thing worshipped other than God and believes with God, so he had held fast/clung to with the tie/handle , the tight/affirmed, no breaking/cutting to it, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable
God (is) guardian/patron (of) those who believed, He brings them out from the darknesses to the light, and those who disbelieved, their guardian/patron (is) the devil/every thing worshipped other than God they bring them out from the light to the darknesses, those are the fire`s owners/company , they are in it immortally/eternally
Did you not see/understand to who quarreled/argued/disputed (with) Abraham in his Lord, that God gave him the ownership/kingdom , when Abraham said: "My Lord, (is) who revives/makes alive and makes die ." He said: "I revive/make alive and I make die." Abraham said: "So then God comes with the sun from the east , so come with it from the west." So who disbelieved was astonished/confused , and God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive
Or like who passed on (by a) village/urban city and it is destroyed/empty on its ceilings/structures .He Said: "How God revives/makes alive this, after its death/ lifelessness?" So God made him die one hundred years, then He revived/resurrected him . He said: "How many/much did you stay/wait/remain?" He said: "I stayed/waited/remained a day or some/part (of) a day." He said: "Yes/but, you stayed/waited/remained one hundred years, so look to your food and your drink, (it) did not change/rot , and look to your donkey and to make/put/manipulate you (E) (as) a sign/evidence to the people, and look to the bones, how We raise and assemble it over each other then We dress/clothe (cover it with) flesh/meat." So when (it) was clarified/explained to him, he said: "I know that God (is) on every thing powerful/capable
And when Abraham said: "My Lord, show me how you revive/make alive the deads." He said: "Did you not believe?" he said: "Yes/certainly, and but (for) my heart/mind to (be) assured/secure (E)." He (Abraham) said: "So take four from the birds, so take them (F) close to you, then put on every mountain from them (F) a part/portion, then call them (F), they come (F) (to) you fast , and know that God isglorious/mighty/powerful/dignified, wise/judicious."

So who came to him (got) a warning/advice from his Lord, so he ended/stopped , so for him what preceded/past , and his matter/affair (is) to God, and who returned , so those are the fire`s owners/company , they are in it immortally/eternally

And whom the duty is on him (the borrower), should dictate (E) , and should fear and obey (E) God his lord, and does (should) not reduce/cheat from it a thing, so if whom the duty is on him (the borrower), was ignorant/foolish or weak, or that he is not able that to dictate he, so his guardian should dictate (E) with justice/equality and call a witness, two witnesses/testifiers from your men, so if they (B) are not two men, so a man and two women, from what/whom you accept/approve from the witnesses/testifiers that (E) one of them (B) be misguided, so she reminds the other (F).

So if they argued/quarreled with you so say: "I submitted/surrendered my face/front to God and who followed me." And say to those who were given The Book and the illiterates/belongers to a nation : "Did you submit/surrender?" So if they submitted/surrendered/became Moslem, so they had been guided, and if they turned, so but on you (is) the information/communication, and God (is) with the worshippers seeing/knowing

The believers do not take the disbelievers (as) guardians/friends from other than the believers, and who does that, so he is not from God in a thing, except that you fear from them fear/fright , and God cautions/warns you (of) Himself, and to God (is) the end/destination
Say: "If you hide what is in your chests (innermosts) or you show it, God knows it, and He knows what (is) in the skies/space, and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and God (is) on every thing capable/able

From those who repented/guided/Jews, they alter the words/expressions from its places, and they say: "We heard/listened and we disobeyed." And hear/listen not making others hear, and: "Observe us ."Distortion with their tongues/languages and defaming in the religion, and if that they said: "We heard/listened and we obeyed and hear/listen and give us time/delay us ." (It) would have been best for them and more just/direct, and but God cursed them, with their disbelief, so they do not believe, except (for a) few. (NOTE: IN HEBREW MEANS `OUR EVIL ONE)
You, you those who were given The Book , believe with what We descended, confirming to what (is) with you (P) from before that We efface/wipe out faces, so We return it on its backs or We curse/humiliate them as We cursed/humiliated the owners of the Saturday/Sabbath, and God`s order/command is/was done
That God does not forgive that to be shared with Him, and He forgives what (is) other than that, to who He wills/wants, and who shares with God, so he fabricated a great sin/crime
Did you not see to those who purify themselves, but God purifies/corrects who He wills/wants, and they are not being caused injustice to, (as little as) a cleft in a seed/twine
See how they are fabricating on God the lies/falsehood, and enough with it, (as an) evident sin/crime
Did you not see to those who were given a share from The Book , they believe with the idol/sorcery/sorcerer and the anything worshipped other than God/the devil , and they say to those who disbelieved: "Those (are) more guided from those who believed (by) a way/path
Those, are those who God cursed/humiliated them, and whom God humiliates, so you will never find for him a victoriors/savior
Or for them (is) a share from the ownership/kingdom , so then they do not give the people (as little as) a peck in a seed/stone
Or do they envy the people with jealousy on what God gave them, from His grace/favour/blessing, so We had given Abraham`s family The Book , and the wisdom, and We gave them a great ownership/kingdom
So from them who believed with (in) Him, and from them who prevented/obstructed from Him, and enough with Hell blazing
That those who disbelieved, with Our verses , We will roast them (in) a fire, whenever their skins were done/cooked (burnt), We replaced/substituted them (with) skins other than it, to taste/experience the torture, that God was/is glorious/mighty , wise/judicious

You, you those who believed, obey God and obey the messenger, and (those) of the order/command from you, so if you disputed in a thing, so return it to God and the messenger, if you were believing with God, and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, that is better and (the) best interpretation/explanation
Did you not see to those who claim that they believed with what was descended to you (S/M), and what was descended from before you, they want that to be judged to the anything worshipped other than God/the devil , and they were ordered/commanded that to disbelieve with it, and the devil wants that to misguide them, (a) far/distant misguidance
And if (it) was said to them: "Come to what God descended and to the messenger." You saw the hypocrites preventing/obstructing from you preventfully/obstructively
So how if a disaster struck them with what their hands advanced/presented/undertook , then they came to you swearing by God: "That truly we wanted except a goodness, and harmony
Those are, those who God knows what (is) in their hearts/minds, so object/oppose from them, and preach/advise/warn them , and say to them in themselves an eloquent/sufficient saying
And We did not sent from a messenger except to be obeyed with God`s permission; and if that when they caused injustice/oppression to themselves, they came to you, so they asked for forgiveness (from) God, and the messenger asked for forgiveness for them, they would have found God forgiving, merciful
So no, and by your Lord, they do not believe, until they appoint you to judge in what quarreled/disputed between them, then they do not find in themselves a strain/blame from what you judged/ordered ,and they submit/surrender submissively/surrenderingly
And if that We wrote/ordered/decreed on them, that kill yourselves or get out from your homes, they would not have done it, except (a) few from them, and if that they did what they are being advised/warned with it (it) would have been best for them, and strongest affirmation
And then We would have given them from at Us a great reward
And We would have guided them a straight/direct road/way
And who obeys God and the messenger, so these (are) with those who God blessed on them from the prophets and the always very truthful, and the witnessing/those killed in God`s sake , and the correct/righteous, and those are a good helper/supporter/companion/friend
That (is) the grace/blessing from God, and enough/sufficient with God knowledgeable
You, you those who believed, take your caution/fear, so rush/hasten (in) groups, or rush/hasten all together
And that from you who (E) will slow/delay/linger (E) , so if a disaster struck you, he said: "God had blessed on me, when I was not present with them
And if (E) grace/blessing from God struck you, he will say (E) as if love/affection/friendship was not between you (P), and between him: "Oh, if only I were with them, so I succeed/win a great success/winning/triumph
So those who volunteer the present world/worldly life with the end (other life) should fight/kill in God`s sake, and who fights/kills in God`s sake, so he is killed or he defeats/conquers, so We will give him a great reward
And for what (why) do you not fight/kill in God`s sake? And the weakened from the men and the women, and the children/newborns, those who say: "Our Lord, bring us out from this the village/urban city, the unjust/oppressive (to) its people, and make for us from at You a guardian/victorior/ally , and make for us from at You a savior/supporter
Those who believed, fight/kill in God`s sake, and those who disbelieved fight/kill in the devil/idol`s sake, so fight/kill the devil`s supporters/allies/followers, that the devil`s conspiracy/deceit was weak
Did you not see to those who were said to them: "Prevent/stop your hands and keep up the prayers, and give the charity." So when the fighting/killing was written/decreed on them, then a group from them fear the people, as God`s fear, or stronger fear, and they said: "Our Lord, for what (did) You write/decree on us the fighting/killing, if only You delayed us to (a) near term/time." Say: "The present world`s enjoyment (is) little, and the end (other life) (is) best to who feared and obeyed, and you do (will) not be caused injustice to/oppressed (as little as) a cleft in a seed
Wherever you are, the death catches up/reaches you , and (even) if you were in towers/castles/constellations built/erected , and if a goodness strikes them, they say: "This (is) from at God." And if a sin/crime (harm) strikes them, they say: "This (is) from at you." Say: "All/each (are) from at God, so how those the nation, they almost do not understand an information/speech
What struck you from a goodness, so (it is) from at God, and what struck you from a sin/crime (harm) so (it is) from your self, and We sent you to the people, (as) a messenger and enough with God, (as) a witness/present
And who obeys the messenger, so he obeyed God, and who turned away, so We did not send you on them (as) a protector
And they say: "Obedience." So if they emerged from at you, a group from them schemed at night other than what you say, and God writes what they scheme at night, so oppose/turn away from them and rely/depend on God, and enough with God (as) a guardian/protector
So do they not consider The Koran, and if (it) were from at other than God, they would have found in it much difference/disagreement
And if a matter/affair from the safety/security or the fear came to them, they spread/circulated with it, and if they returned it to the messenger and to (those) of the order/command from them; those who from them conclude/discover (understand) it would have known it (E), and where it not for God`s grace/favour/blessing on you, and His mercy, you would have followed the devil, except a few (from you)
So fight/kill in God`s sake, you are not burdened/imposed upon except (with) your self, and instigate/urge/encourage the believers, maybe that God prevents/stops those who disbelieved`s might/power, and God (is) stronger power/might, and stronger severe exemplary punishment
Who mediates a good mediation, for him is a share from it, and who mediates a bad/evil mediation, for him is a share from it, and God was/is on every thing providing
And if you were greeted with a greeting, so greet with better from (than) it, or return it, that God was/is on every thing counting/calculating
God, no God except He/Him, He will gather/collect you (E) to the Resurrection Day, no doubt/suspicion in it; and who (is) more truthful from (than) God (in) an information/speech
So what for you (so why are you being divided) two groups in (regarding) the hypocrites? And God set them back because (of) what they gathered, do you want that to guide who God misguided? And who God misguides, so you will not find for him a path/means
They wished/loved if you disbelieve, as they disbelieved, so you become equal/alike. So do not take from them allies , until they emigrate in God`s sake, so if they turned away, so take/punish them and fight/kill them, where/when you found them, and do not take from them an ally , and nor a supporter/savior
Except those who reach to (a) nation between you and between them (is) a) covenant (treaty), or they came to you, their chests (are) restricted/depressed , that they fight/kill you, or they fight/kill their nation, and if God wanted/willed, He would have empowered them on you, so they would have fought/killed you (P), so if they separated/isolated themselves from you , so they did not fight/kill you, and they threw (offered) to you the peace/surrender , so God did not make for you on them a path/means
You will find others, they want that they (be) secured by you (have peace with you), and they be trusted/secured (by) their nation, whenever they are returned to the treason , they were made to be set back/replaced in it, so if they did not separate/ isolate/withdraw themselves from you , and they (did not) throw (offer) to you the peace/surrender , and (nor) they stop their hands, so take them and58fight/kill them where/when you defeated them/caught up with them, and those, We made for you on them a clear/evident power
And (it) was/is not to a believer that he kills a believer except mistakenly, and who killed a believer mistakenly, so freeing/liberating a believing neck (slave), and compensation handed over/delivered to his (the victim`s) family, except that they give charity (forgive), so if he was from a nation, an enemy for you, and he (the victim was) a believer, so freeing/liberating a believing neck (slave), and if he was/is from a nation between you and between them (is) a covenant (treaty), so a compensation handed over/delivered to his (the victim`s) family and freeing/liberating a believing neck (slave), so who does not find, so fasting two months following each other (E), a repentance from at God, and God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious
And who kills a believer intentionally/purposely, so his reward (repayment/retribution is) Hell immortally/eternally in it, and God became angry on him, and He cursed/humiliated him, and He prepared for him a great torture
You, you those who believed, if you moved in God`s sake, so seek clarification/explanation , and do not say to who threw (offered) the peace/surrender/greeting , you are not a believer, you wish/desire the life the present`s/worldly life`s enjoyable accessories, so at God (are) many winnings/gains/spoils, like that you were from before, so God blessed on you, so seek clarification/explanation, that God was/is with what you make/do expert/experienced
From the believers the remaining (behind) not/other than those of the difficult circumstances and the struggling/defending for God`s sake with their properties and themselves do not become equal, God preferred the struggling/defending with their properties and themselves over the remaining in a stage/degree, and each/all God promised the goodness, and God preferred the struggling/defending above the remaining (by) a great reward
Stages/degrees from Him and a forgiveness and a mercy, and God was/is a forgiver, merciful
That those the angels make them die, unjust (to) themselves, they said: "In what you were/have been?" They said: "We were weakened in the Earth/land." They said: "Was not God`s Earth/land wide/spacious so you emigrate in it." So those, their shelter/refuge (is) Hell, and it was a bad/evil end/destination
Except the weakened from the men, and the women, and the children, they are not able (of a) solution (means) and nor they be guided a way/path
So those, maybe God that He forgives/pardons on them, and God was/is often forgiving, (a) forgiver
And who emigrates in God`s sake, he finds in the earth an escape , and a wealth/an abundance, and who gets out from his house emigrating to God and His messenger, then the death overtakes him, so his reward had fallen/been placed on God, and God was/is a forgiver, merciful
And if you (P) moved in the Earth/land, so offense/guilt is not on you, that you shorten/reduce from the prayers if you feared that those who disbelieved betray/torture you , that the disbelievers are/were to you an evident, an enemy. (NOTE: THE CONDITION FOR REDUCTION OR SHORTENING OF PRAYERS DURING TRAVEL IN THE PRECEDING VERSE)
And if you were in them, so you started for them the prayer, so a group from them should stand with you, and they should take their weapons/arms, so if they prostrated, so they be from behind you, and another group should come (that) they did not pray, so they pray (E) with you, and they should take their caution, and their weapons/arms; those who disbelieved, wished if you ignore/neglect your weapons/arms, and your belongings/effects/goods, so they lean on you one bend, and no offense/guilt (is) on you if mild harm was with you from rain or you were sick/diseased, that you lay your weapons/arms, and take your caution, that God prepared to the disbelievers a degrading/humiliating torture
So if you (P) accomplished the prayers, so mention/remember God standing, and sitting, and on your sides, so if you became secured, so keep up the prayers, that the prayers was/is on the believers decreed (at) appointed times . (NOTE: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PRAYERS, ITS TIMES, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF REPEATEDLY MENTIONING GOD THROUGHOUT THE DAY IN THE PRECEDING VERSE)
And do not weaken in asking/desiring the nation, if you are feeling pain, so then they are feeling pain, as/like you feel pain/ache, and you hope/expect from God what they do not hope/expect, and God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious
That We have descended to you The Book with the truth to judge/rule between the people with what God showed you, and do not be to the betrayers an arguer

And who acquires/carries a sin or a sin/crime , then he blames and accuses an innocent, so he had carried wrongfully/slanderfully and an evident sin/crime
And where it not for God`s grace/favour/blessing on you and His mercy, a group from them resolved/started (E) that (to) misguide you, and they do not misguide except themselves, and they do not harm you from a thing, and God descended on you The Book and the wisdom, and He taught you, what you did (and) were not to know, and God`s grace/favour on you was/is great
(There is) no goodness in much from their confidential talk/secret conversation, except who ordered/commanded with charity or kindness or reconciliation between the people, and who does that asking/desiring God`s satisfactions, so We will give him a great reward
And who defies/makes animosity with the messenger from after the guidance was clarified to him and he follows other than the believers` way/path, We enable him what he followed , and We roast/make him suffer Hell, and it was a bad end/destination
That God does not forgive that He be made a partner with Him, and He forgives what (is) other than that to whom He wants/wills, and who shares/makes partners with God, so he had misguided a distant misguidance
That they call from other than Him except females, and that they call except a rebellious/evil devil
God cursed him , and he (the devil) said: "I will take (E) from your worshippers/slaves a specified share
And I will misguide them (E), and I will make them desire (E), and I will order/command them (E), so they will cut (E) the animals`/livestock`s ears, and I will order/command them (E), so they will change (E) God`s creation. And who takes the devil (as) a guardian/ally from other than God, so he had lost an evident loss

You my nation, enter the earth the Holy that God wrote/dictated for you, and do not return on your backs, so you turn around losers
They said: "You Moses, that in it (is) a nation (of) tyrants/rebels , and that we will never/not enter it until they get out from it, so if they get out from it, so we are entering
Two men from those who fear (and) God blessed/comforted and eased on them (B), said: "Enter on them (through) the door/entrance, so if you entered it, so that you are defeating/conquering, and on God so rely/depend , if you were/are believers

So he became from the regretful/sorrowful/remorseful
Because of that, We wrote/decreed on Israel`s sons and daughters, that who killed a self without a self, or corruption in the earth/Planet Earth, so (it is) as if he killed the people all/all together , and who revived (saved) it, so as if he revived (saved) the people all/all together, and Our messengers had come to them with the evidences, then that many from them, after that (are) in the earth/Planet Earth spoilers/wasters (E)

You, you the messenger, do not be saddened (by) those who quicken/speed in the disbelief, from those who said: "We believed" with their mouths, and their hearts/minds did not believe, and from those who repented/Jews (who are) often listening/hearing to the lie/falsehood, (and) often listening/hearing to other nations (that) they did not come to you, they alter/distort the words/expressions from after its places, they71say: "If you were given that, so take it , and if you were not given it, so be warned ." And whom God wants testing him , so you will never own/possess for him from God a thing, those are those who God did not want that to purify their hearts/minds , for them in the present world (is) shame/scandal/ disgrace, and for them in the end (other life is) a great torture
(They are) often listening/hearing to the lie/falsehood, gluttons/eating exaggeratedly to the forbidden/possession through cheatery , so if they came to you, so judge/rule between them or turn away from them, and if you turn away from them, so they will never/not harm you (in) a thing, and if you judged/ruled, so judge/rule between them with the just/equitable, that God loves/likes the just/equitable
And how (do) they ask you to judge/rule, and at them (is) the Torah/Old Testament, in it (is) God`s judgment/rule, then they turn away from after that, and those are not with the believing
That We descended the Torah/Old Testament, in it (is) guidance and light, the prophets those who submitted/surrendered , judge/rule with it, to those who guided/Jews , and the knowledgeable Lord worshippers , and the religious scholars with what they memorized/safe kept (learned) from God`s Book , and they were not on it witnessing/present ; so do not fear the people and fear Me, and do not buy/volunteer with My signs/verses a small price, and who does not judge/rule with what God descended, so those, they are the disbelievers
And We wrote/decreed on them in it, that the self (is) with the self, and the eye (is) with the eye, and the nose (is) with the nose, and the ear (is) with the ear, and the tooth (is) with the tooth, and the wounds/cuts (are) equal revenge/punishment equal to crime, so who gave charity (forgave) with it, so it is cover/substitution for him, and who does not judge/rule with what God descended, so those, those are the unjust/oppressors

And the New Testament`s/Bible`s people should judge/rule with what God descended in it, and who does not judge/rule with what God descended, so those, they are the debauchers
And We descended to you The Book with the truth , confirming to what (is) between his hands from The Book , and guarding/protecting on it, so judge/rule between them with what God descended and do not follow their self attractions for desires about what came to you from the truth, to each from you We made/put God`s decreed way of life/method/law and order , and a clear/easy/plain way , and if God wanted/willed, He would have made you one nation/generation, and but to test you in what He gave you, so race/surpass (to) the goodnesses/generosity (good deeds), to God (is) your return altogether, so He informs you with what you were in it differing/disagreeing (P)
And that judge/rule between them with what God descended, and do not follow their self attractions for desires , and be warned/cautious of them, that they test/misguide you from some/part (of) what God descended to you, so if they turned away, so know that God wants that (He) strikes/hits them with some/part (of) their72crimes, and that many of the people (are) debauchers (E)
Is (it) the Pre-Islamic paganism`s/ignorance`s judgment/rule (that) they desire ? And who (is) better than God (in) judgment/ruling to a nation they be sure/certain
You, you those who believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians (as) guardians/patrons , some of them (are) guardians/patrons (of) some, and who follows them from you, so that he truly is from them, that God does not guide the nation, the unjust/oppressive
So you see those who in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease, they rush/speed in (to) them, they say: "We fear that disaster strikes/hits us, so maybe that God comes with the victory or an order/matter from at Him." So they become on what they kept secret in themselves regretful
And those who believed, say: "Are those, those who swore by God their right`s/oath`s utmost that they (are) with you (E), their deeds wasted, so they became losers
You, you those who believed, who returns from you from his religion, so God will come with a nation, He loves/likes them, and they love/like Him, on the believers humble , more glorious/mighty on the disbelievers, they struggle in God`s sake , and they do not fear a blamer`s/reprimanders`s blame/reprimand, that (is) God`s grace/favour, He gives it (to) whom He wills/wants, and God (is) rich/abundant , knowledgeable
But your guardian/patron/ally (is) God, and His messenger; and those who believed they keep up the prayers, and they give the charity , and they are bowing
And who follows God and His messenger and those who believed, so that God`s group/party, they are the defeaters/conquerors
You, you those who believed, do not take those who took your religion mockingly and playing/amusement from those who were given The Book from before you, and the disbelievers (as) guardians/patrons/allies , and fear and obey God, if you were believing
And if you called to (for) the prayers, they took it mockingly and playing/amusement, that (is) with that they are a nation (that) do not reason/understand/comprehend
Say: "You The Book`s people, do (you) revenge/hate from us, except (because) that we believed with God, and what was descended to us, and what was descended from before, and that most of you (are) debauchers
Say: "Do I inform you with worse/more hateful than that? Replacement/compensation (from) at God, whom God cursed/humiliated , and He became angry/angered (at) on him, and He made/created from them the apes/monkeys and the pigs/swine , and the everything worshipped other than God`s/devil`s worshippers, those (are at) a worse place/position and more misguided, from the way`s/road`s middle/straightness
And if they came to you, they said: "We believed". And they had entered with the disbelief, and they, they had gotten out with it, and God (is) more knowing with what they were hiding/concealing
And you see many from them, quickening/rushing in the sin/crime, and the transgression/aggression ,and their eating the forbidden/possessions acquired through cheatery , how bad (E) (is) what they were73making/doing
If only the knowledgeable lord worshippers and the religious scholars forbid/prevent them from their saying the sin/crime and their eating the forbidden/possessions acquired through cheatery ; how bad (E) (is) what they were producing/manufacturing
And the Jews said: "God`s hand (is) chained or tied." (But) their hands (are) chained or tied, and they were cursed/humiliated because (of) what they said, but His two hands (are) outspread/outstretched , He spends how (as) He wills/wants; and what was descended to you from your Lord increases (E) many of them tyranny/arrogance and disbelief, and We threw between them the animosity and the intense hatred to the Resurrection Day, whenever they ignited a fire to the battle/war , God extinguished it , and they strive/hasten in the earth/Planet Earth (in) corruption , and God does not love/like the corrupting
And if that The Book`s people believed and feared and obeyed We would have substituted from them their sins/crimes, and We would have entered them the blessing`s gardens
And if that they took care of the Torah/Old Testament, and the Bible/New Testament and what was descended to them from their Lord, they would have eaten from above them and from below their feet; from them (is) a nation economizing/moderate , and many from them what they were making/doing became bad/evil/harmful
You, you the messenger deliver/inform what was descended to you from your Lord, and if you did not make/do (that) so you did not reach (pass) His message, and God protects/shelters you from the people, that God does not guide the nation, the disbelieving
Say: "You The Book`s people, you are not on a thing, until you keep up the Torah/Old Testament and the Bible/New Testament , and what was descended to you from your (P) Lord." And what was descended to you (S/M) from your Lord increases (E) many of them tyranny/arrogance, and disbelief, so do not grieve/sadden on the nation, the disbelieving
That those who believed and those who guided/Jews , and the converts/Sabians , and the Christians who believed with God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and made/worked correct/righteous deeds, so no fear on them, and nor they be sad/grieving
We had taken Israel`s sons` and daughters` promise/covenant, and We sent to them messengers, whenever a messenger came to them with what their selves do not desire, a group (some) they denied, and a group (some) they kill
And they thought, that test/torture (is) not (to) be, so they became blinded/confused , and they became deaf, then God forgave on them, then they blinded/confused and they deafened many (of) them, and God (is) seeing/knowing/understanding with what they make/do/work
Those who said: "That God, He is the Messiah Mary`s son," had disbelieved, and the Messiah, said: "You, Israel`s sons and daughters, worship God, my Lord and your Lord, that he who shares/makes partners with God, so He had forbidden on him the Paradise, and his shelter/refuge (is) the fire , and (there are) no victoriors/saviors to the unjust/oppressors
Those who said: "That God (is) third (of) three." had disbelieved, and (there is) no God except from one God, and if they do not end/stop from what they say, a painful torture will touch (E) those who disbelieved from them
So do they not repent to God, and they ask Him for forgiveness, and God (is) forgiving, merciful
The Messiah Mary`s son is not except a messenger, the messengers had past/expired from before Him, and his mother (was) always very truthful, they were (B) eating the food; look/see how We clarify/explain to them the signs/evidences, then look/see where they be turned away
Say: "Do you worship from other than God what does not own/possess for you harm and nor benefit, and God He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable
Say: "You The Book`s people, do not exaggerate/exceed the limit in your religion, other than the truth , and do not follow a nation`s self attractions for desires , they had misguided from before and they misguided many, and they misguided from the way`s/path`s middle/straightness
Those who disbelieved from Israel`s sons and daughters were cursed/humiliated on David`s and Jesus Mary`s son`s tongue, that (is) with what they disobeyed, and they were transgressing/violating
They were not forbidding/preventing each other from awfulness/obscenity they made/did it; how bad (is) what they were making/doing
You see many from them, they follow those who disbelieved, how bad (is) what their selves advanced/understood for them, that God became angry/dissatisfied on them, and in the torture they are immortally/eternally
And if they were believing with God, and the prophet and what was descended to him, they would not (have) taken them (as) guardians/allies , and but many from them (are) debauchers
You will find (E) the strongest people (with) animosity to those who believed (are) the Jews, and those who shared/made partners (with God), and you will find (E) their nearest/closest love/friendship , to those who believed, (are) those who said: "That we are Christian ." That (is) with that from them (are) priests/clergymen and monks, and that they are not being arrogant
And if they heard what was descended to the messenger, you see their eyes flow from the tears from what they knew from the truth , they say: "Our Lord, we believed, so write us with the witnessing/testifying
And why not for us to believe with God and what came to us from the truth , and we wish/desire that our Lord makes us enter with the nation the correct/righteous
So God rewarded them because (of) what they said treed gardens, the rivers flow from beneath it, immortally/eternally in it, and that (is) the good doer`s reward
And those who disbelieved and they denied with Our verses/signs/evidences, those are the Hell`s people
You, you those who believed, do not forbid/prohibit goodnesses (from) what God permitted/allowed for you, and do not transgress/violate , that God does not love/like the transgressors/violators
And eat from what God provided for you, permitted/allowed, good/enjoyable , and fear and obey God, whom you are with (in) him believing
God does not punish you with the nonsense/useless talk in your oaths, and but He punishes you with75what you intended (in) the oaths, so its cover/substitution (is) feeding ten poorest of poor/poor oppressed from middle (average of) what you feed your families , or their dressing/clothing, or feeding/liberating a neck/person/slave, so who does not find, so fasting three days, that (is) cover/substitution (for) your oaths, if you swore/took oath, and guard your oaths, like that God clarifies to you His verses/evidences, maybe you thank/be grateful
You, you those who believed, that the intoxicants , and the gambling and the monuments , and the featherless arrows (are) sin/crime from the devil`s making/work, so avoid it , maybe you succeed/win
But the devil wants that he makes the animosity and the intense hatred fall between you, in (through use of) the intoxicants and the gambling, and he prevents/obstructs you from God`s remembrance/reminder, and from the prayers, so are you ending/stopping
And obey God and obey the messenger, and be warned/cautious, so if you turned away, so know that truly on Our messengers (is) the information/communication, the clear/evident
(An) offense/guilt is not on those who believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds in what they ate/tasted, if as long as they feared and obeyed and believed and they made/did the correct/righteous deeds, then they feared and obeyed and they believed, and then they feared and obeyed, and they did good and God loves/likes the good doers
You, you those who believed, God will test you (E) with something from the hunt/fishing/trapping, your hands and your spears/lances take/receive/obtain (reach) it, (for) God (is) to know who fears Him with the unseen , so who transgressed/violated after that, so for him (is) a painful torture
You, you those who believed, do not kill the hunt/trapping, and you are forbidden/respecting for pilgrimage, and who intentionally/purposely killed it from you, so a reimbursement equal/similar (to) what he killed from the properties/livestock (the animals/birds), (two) of (B) justice/equality from you judges/rules with it (as) an offering reaching/delivered (to) the Kaaba , or substitution (of) feeding (the) poorest of poor/poor oppressed (P), or redemption (of) that (is) fasting , to taste/experience his matter`s/affair`s severity/bad consequences/evil results, God forgave/pardoned on what preceded, and who returned (again), so God revenges from Him, and God (is) glorious/mighty , (owner) of revenge
Permitted/allowed for you is the sea`s hunting/fishing, and its food, enjoyment to you and to the caravan/people often moving , and forbidden on you (is) the shore`s/land`s hunting/trapping as long as you continued in compliance with pilgrimage prohibitions , and fear and obey God, who to Him you are being gathered
God put/made the Kaaba, the House/Home the Respected/Sacred standing to (for) the people and the forbidden/sacred the month and the offering and the necklaces , that to know that God knows what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and that God (is) with every thing knowledgeable
Know that God (is) strong (severe in) the punishment and that God (is) forgiving, merciful
Nothing (is) on the messenger except the information/communication, and God knows what you show and what you hide/conceal
Say: "The bad/spoiled and the good/pure do not become equal/alike, and even if it pleased/marveled you the bad`s/spoiled`s plentifulness, so fear and obey God, you (owners) of the pure minds/intelligences ,maybe/perhaps you win/succeed
You, you those who believed, do not question/ask about things, if (it) appears to you, it harms you , and if you ask/question about it a time (when) the Koran descends (it) appears to you, God forgave/pardoned about it, and God (is) forgiving/clement
A nation from before you had asked/questioned (about) it, then they became with it disbelieving
God did not make/create from a female camel in Pre-Islamic paganism whose ears were split after five deliveries and left to roam alone for their idols and of no benefit to man , and nor a female camel in Pre-Islamic paganism which gave birth to ten female litters and left to roam and feed freely and forbidden from use , and nor a female camel who gave birth seven times and was left to roam and not be slaughtered , and nor a male camel who fathered ten deliveries and was left to roam without benefit to man , and but those who disbelieved they fabricate on God the lies/falsehood, and most of them do not reason/understand/comprehend. (DISCREPANCY EXISTS ABOUT THE PRECEDING BOLD TERM)
And if (it) was said to them: "Come to what God descended and to the messenger." They said: "Enough for us what we found our fathers on it." And even if their fathers were not knowing a thing and nor being guided
You, you those who believed, on you (are) yourselves, who misguided does not harm you if you were guided, to God (is) your return all together, so He informs you with what you were making/doing
You, you those who believed testimony between you if the death attended any of you (at the) time of the bequest/will (bring) two of justice from you or two others from other than you, if you, you moved/mixed in the Earth/land, so the death`s/liflessness`s disaster struck you , you prevent/withhold them (B) from after the prayers, so they (B) swear/make oath with God: "If you become doubtful/suspicious we do not buy volunteer (ourselves) with it a price, and even if (he or she was) of the relations/near, and we do not hide/conceal God`s witness/certification , that we are then from (E) the sinners/criminals
So if (it) was stumbled upon (found) on that they (B) deserved (B) (committed) a sin/crime, so two others they (B) stay in their (B)`s place/position from those who deserved on them the first two, so they (B) swear/make oath with God (that) "Our testimony/certification (is) more worthy/deserving from (than) their (B)`s testimony/certification, and we did not transgress/violate/break, (and if we did) that we (are) then from (E) the unjust/oppressors (P)
That (is) nearer that they come with the testimony/certification on its face/direction , or they fear that oaths be returned after their oaths, and fear and obey God and hear/listen, and God does not guide the nation the debauchers
A day God gathers/collects the messengers, so he says: "What were you answered/replied?" They said: "No knowledge for us, that you (are) knower (of) the unseens/hiddens (unknown)
when God said: "You Jesus Mary`s son, remember My blessing on you and on your mother, when I supported you with the Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Spirit, you speak/converse (to) the people in the crib/cradle and aged77approximately between thirty to fifty years , and when I taught/instructed/informed you The Book , and the wisdom , and the Torah/Old Testament, and the New Testament/Bible , and when you create as a shape/form (of) the bird/birds with My permission, so you blow in it, so it will be flying/birds, with My permission, and you cure and heal the blind/born blind, and the leper with My permission, and when you bring out the deads with My permission, and when I prevented/stopped Israel`s sons and daughters from you, when you came to them with the evidences, so those who disbelieved from them said: "That that (is) except clear/evident magic/sorcery
And when I inspired to the supporters and deciples that believe in Me and My messenger, they said: "We believed and witness with that we truly (are) submitters/surrenderers
When the supporters and Deciples said: "You, Jesus Mary`s son, is your Lord able that He descends on us a table with food from the sky?" He said: "Fear and obey God if you were believing
They said: "We want that we eat from it, and our hearts/minds (be) assured , and we know that you had been truthful to us, and we be on it from the present/witnessing
Jesus, Mary`s son said: "Oh God, our Lord, descend on us a table with food from the sky, (it) be for us a repeat/feast/festival to our beginning/first and our last/end, and a sign/evidence from You, and provide for us, and You are the provider`s best
God said: "That I am descending it on you, so who disbelieves after (this) from you, so I am I (will) torture him, a torture, I do (will) not torture it anyone from the creations altogether/(universes)
And when God said: "You Jesus Mary`s son, did you say to the people `Take me and my mother (as) two gods from other than God?` He (Jesus) said: `Your praise/glory, (it) is not to be for me that I say what is not for me with (a) right/truth, if I was (had) said it, so You had known it, You know what (is) in my self, and I do not know what (is) in Your self, that You, You (are) all knower (of) the unseens/hidden (unknown)
I did not say to them except what You ordered/commanded me with it, that worship God, my Lord and your Lord, and I was on them a witness as long as I continued/lasted in (between) them, so when You made me die, You were the guard on them, and you (are) on every thing (an) honest witness
If You torture them, so that they are Your worshippers/slaves, and if You forgive for them, so that You are the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious
God said: "That (is a) day, the truthful their truthfulness benefits (them), for them (are) treed gardens, the rivers flow from beneath it, (they are) immortally/eternally in it, forever, God approved on them, and they approved on Him, that (is) the great winning/salvation
To God (are) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s ownership , and what (is) in them (F), and He (is) on every thing capable
The praise/gratitude (is) to God, who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He made/created the darknesses and the light, then those who disbelieved with their Lord make equals (to Him)
He is who created you from mud/clay , then He passed judgment/ordered a term/time, and (a) term/time identified (specified) at Him, then you are arguing/doubting
And He is God in the skies/space and in the earth/Planet Earth, He knows your secret and your publicized ,and He knows what you gain/acquire
And no verse/evidence from their Lord`s verses/evidences comes to them except they were from it objecting/opposing
So they had denied/lied with the truth when it came to them, so information/news (of) what they were with it mocking/making fun of will come to them
Did they not see/understand how many from before them We destroyed from (a) people of one era/generation/century, We highly positioned them in the earth/Planet Earth, what We did not highly position for you, and We sent the sky/space on them flowing/pouring abundantly, and We made the rivers flow from beneath them, so We destroyed them, because of their crimes, and We created from after them others (another) people of one era/generation/century
And if We descended on you (S/M) a Book in paper/parchment, so they touched/touched and felt it with their hands, those who disbelieved would have said: "That that (is) except clear/evident magic/sorcery
And they said: "If only (an) angel was descended on him." And if We descended an angel, the matter/affair would have been executed/ended , then they (would) not be given time/delayed
And if We made him an angel, We would have made him a man, We would have dressed on him (from) what they dress
And had been mocked at messengers from before you, so those who mocked from them were afflicted/surrounded with what they were with it mocking/making fun
Say: "Walk/move in the Earth/land, then look/wonder about how was the liars`/falsifiers` end/turn (result)
Say: "To whom, what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth?" Say: "To God, He decreed on Himself the mercy, He will gather/collect you to the Resurrection Day, no doubt/suspicion in it, those who lost themselves, so they are not believing
And for Him (is) what settled in the night and the daytime, and He (is) the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable
Say: "Is other than God, I take (as) a guardian , (the) creator (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He feeds and is not fed." Say: "I was ordered/commanded that I be first (of) who surrendered/submitted, and do not be (E) from the sharers/takers of partners (with God)
Say: "That I, I fear if I disobeyed my Lord (from) a great day`s torture
Who is diverted from it (on) that day, so He had mercy upon him, and that (is) the clear/evident success/triumph
And if God touches you with harm, so (there is)no remover/uncoverer for it except He, and if He touches you with goodness , so He is on every thing capable
And He is the defeater/conqueror over His worshippers/slaves, and He is the wise/judicious, the expert/experienced
Say: "Which thing (is) greater (in) testimony/certification ?" Say: "God (is an) honest witness between me and between you (P), and (it is) transmitted/revealed to me this the Koran, to warn you with it and who (was) reached (informed); that you are witnessing/testifying (E), that with God, (are) other Gods." Say: "I do not witness/testify." Say: "But He is one God, and that I am innocent from what you share (with God)
Those whom We brought to (gave) them The Book , they know it as they know their sons, those who lost themselves, so they do not believe
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on God lies/falsifications or denied/falsified with His verses/evidences, that He does not (allow) the unjust/oppressors (to) succeed/win
And a day We gather them all together, then We say to those who shared (with God): "Where (are) your partners (Idols with God), those who you were claiming/supporting
Then their false tales/misguidance (excuse was not), except that they said: "By God, our Lord, we were not sharing (with God)
See/look how they lied on (to) themselves, and what they were fabricating (was) wasted/lost from them
And from them who listens to you, and We put on their hearts/minds covers/protections, that they (not) understand/learn it, and in their ears deafness/heaviness, and if they see every evidence/sign/verse, they do not believe with it until when/if they came to you arguing/disputing with you, those who disbelieved, say: "That that (is) except the first`s/beginner`s myths
And they forbid/prevent from it, and they go far from it, and that they truly destroy (non) except themselves, and they do not feel/know
And if you see/understand, if they were suspended/stood on the fire, so they said: "Oh, if only we be returned and we not lie/deny/falsify with our Lord`s verses/evidences, and we be from the believers
But/rather it appeared to them what they were hiding from before, and even if they were returned they would have returned (repeated) to what they were forbidden prevented from it, and that they truly are lying/denying/falsifying (E)
And they said: "That truly it is except our life the present life/worldly life, we are not with being resurrected/revived
And if you see/understand if they stopped/arrested at their Lord, he said: "Is that not with the truth/real ?" They said: "Yes/certainly, by our Lord." He said: "So taste/experience the torture, with what you were disbelieving
Those who denied had lost with God`s meeting until when the Hour/Resurrection came to them82suddenly, they said: "Oh, our grief/sorrow on what we neglected/wasted in it." And they are carrying their sins on their backs, is it not evil/harmful what they carry/bear
And the life the present/worldly life is not except playing/amusement/enjoyment and play things , and (the) end`s (other life`s) house/home (E) (is) better to those who fear and obey, so do you not reason/understand
We had known that it saddens you (E) what they say, so they truly do not deny you, and but the unjust/oppressors, (are) disbelieving and denying with God`s verses/evidences
And messengers from before you had been lied to/denied, so they were patient on what they were denied (rejected) and they were harmed mildly, until Our victory/aid came to them, and (there is) no exchanger to God`s words/expressions; and from the messengers` information/news had come to you
And if their objection/opposition has become a burden on you, so if you were able, that (E) you desire/wish a tunnel in the earth/Planet Earth, or a ladder in the sky/space, so you come to them with a verse/evidence, and if God wanted/willed He would have gathered/collected them on the guidance, so do not be (E) from the ignorant/lowly (P)
But those who hear/listen answer/reply, and the deads, God sends/resurrects/revives them, then to Him they return
And they said: "If only a sign/verse/evidence was descended on him from his Lord." Say: "That God (is) capable that on to descend a sign/verse/evidence." And but most of them do not know
And (there is) not from a walker/creeper/crawler (creature) in the earth/Planet Earth and nor (a) bird (that) flies with its two wings, except (they are) nations similar/equal to you, We did not neglect/waste in The Book from a thing, then to their Lord they be gathered
And those who lied/denied with Our verses/signs/evidences (they are) deaf and mute in the darknesses; whom God wants/wills He misguides him, and whom He wants/wills, He puts him on a straight/direct road/way
Say: "Did I show you/make you understand, if God`s torture came to you, or the Hour/Resurrection came to you, is (it) other than God you call, if you are/were truthful
But (only) Him you call, so He removes/uncovers what you call to (for) it, if He wants/wills, and you forget what you share/make partners (with God)
And We had sent to nations from before you, so We took/punished them with the misery/hardship/fear and the calamity, maybe they become humble and humiliate themselves (to God)
So where it not for when Our might came to them, they became humble and humiliated themselves, and but their hearts/minds became cruel/merciless, and the devil decorated/beautified for them what they were making/doing
So when they forgot what they were reminded with it, We opened on them every thing`s doors/entrances, until when they became happy/delighted with what they were given, (then) We took/punished them suddenly, so then they are confused/dumbfounded
So (it was) cut off/separated (the) root/remainder (of) the nation those who caused injustice/oppression, and the praise/gratitude (is) to God the creations altogether`s/(universe`s) Lord
Say: "Did you see/understand, if God took your sense of hearing and your eye sights/understanding, and sealed/stamped on your hearts/minds , which god other than God comes to you with it?" See how We83elaborate linguistically the signs/verses/evidences, then they turn away/avoid
Say: "Did I show you, if God`s torture came to you suddenly or publicly/loudly , does except the nation the unjust/oppressors be destroyed
And We do not sent the messengers except (as) announcers of good news and warners/givers of notice, so who believed and corrected/repaired, so no fear on them and nor they be sad/grievous
And those who denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences, the torture touches them because of what they were debauching
Say: "I do not say to you, at me (are) God`s safes/storages (treasures), and I do not know the unseen/absent ,and I do not say to you that I am (an) angel/king/owner , that I follow except what (is) transmitted/revealed to me." Say: "Do the blind, and the seeing become equal/alike, so do you not think
And warn with it those who fear that they be gathered to their Lord, (there) is not for them a guardian , and nor a mediator other than Him, maybe they fear and obey
And do not expel/drive away those who call their Lord with the early mornings and the evening ,they want His face/direction, their account is not on you from a thing, and your account is not on them from a thing, so you expel them/drive them away, so you be from the unjust/oppressive (P)
And like that We tested/allured some of them with some, to say (P): "Are those (who) God blessed on them from between us?" Is God not more knowing with the thankful/grateful
And if those who believe came to you with Our verses/evidences, so say: "A greeting/peace on you, your Lord decreed on Himself the mercy, that who from you made/did bad/evil/harm with ignorance/foolishness, then he repented from after it, and corrected/repaired, so that He truly is a forgiver, merciful
And like that We explain/clarify the verses/evidences , and to clarify/show/explain the criminal`s/sinner`s path/road
Say: "That I, I was forbidden/prevented that I worship those who you call from other than God." Say: "I do not follow your self attractions for desires I had then become misguided, and I am not from the guided
Say: "That I (am) on an evidence from my Lord, and you denied/falsified with it; at me is not what you hurry/urge with it, that the judgment/rule (is) except to God, He narrates/informs the truth , and He (is) best (of) the judges/separators
Say: "If that at me (is) what you hurry/urge with it, the matter/affair would have been executed/carried out between me and between you, and God (is) more knowing with the unjust/oppressors
And at Him (are) the unseen`s/absent`s/super natural`s keys/treasures, no (one) knows it except He, and He knows what (is) in the land/shore and the sea/ocean , and (nothing) from a leaf/piece of paper does not fall/drop except He knows it, and nor a seed/grain in the earth`s darknesses and nor soft/ripe , and nor dry (hard) except (it is documented) in (an) evident Book
And He is who makes you die at the night and He knows what you earned/committed at the daytime, then He resurrects/revives you in it to be executed/carried out an identified (specified) term/time, then to Him (is) your return, then He informs you with what you were making/doing
And He is the defeater/conqueror over His worshippers/slaves, and He sends on you caretakers/keepers/angels until if the death came (to) any of you, Our messengers made him die, and they do not neglect/waste
Then they were returned to God their correct/real owner/master; is it not to Him the judgment/rule? And He is the counter`s/calculator`s faster (fastest)
Say: "Who saves/rescues you from (the) darknesses (of) the land/shore and the sea/ocean, you call Him humbly and humiliated and secretly: "If (E) He saved/rescued us from this we will become (E) from the thankful/grateful
Say: "God saves/rescues you from it, and from every grief, hardship and suffering , then you are sharing/making partners (with God)
Say: "He is the capable on that He sends on you a torture, from above you, or from beneath your feet, or He mixes/confuses you (into) groups/parties, and makes some of you taste/experience (the) courage/might (of) some, look/consider/perceive how We elaborate linguistically the verses/evidences, maybe they understand/learn
And your nation denied/lied/falsified with it, and it is the truth . Say: "I am not with a protector/guardian on (for) you
To each information/news (is a) settlement/affixation (time) and you will/shall know
And if you saw those who plunge into/engage in conversation (interpreting beyond the actual Koranic text) in Our verses/evidences, so turn away from them until they plunge into/engage in conversation in an information/speech other than it, and if the devil makes you forget, so do not sit/remain after the remembrance/reminder with the nation, the unjust/oppressive
And there is not from a thing on those who fear and obey (God) from their account/calculation (those who fear and obey God need not worry about their account), and but (it is) a remembrance/reminder, maybe they fear and obey
And leave those who took their religion playing/amusement and a play thing/amusement, and the life the present/worldly life has deceived/tempted them, and remind them with it, that a self be exposed/made to surrender to destruction because (of) what it earned/acquired , (there) is not a guardian for it, and nor a mediator from other than God, and if it ransoms/redeems every ransom/redemption (it will) not be taken from it, those are those who were exposed/made to surrender to destruction because (of) what they earned/acquired , for them (is) a drink from hot water/sweat , and a painful torture because (or) what they were disbelieving
Say: "Do we call from other than God what does not benefit us, and nor harms us, and we be returned on our heels, after when God guided us, as/like whom the devil tempted/allured him , in the earth/Planet Earth, confused/bewildered, for him (are) friends/company, they call him to the guidance: `Come to us.`" Say: "That God`s guidance, it is the guidance, and we were ordered/commanded to surrender to the creations altogether`s/(universes`) Lord
And that keep up the prayers and fear and obey Him, and He is who to Him you are being gathered/collected
And He is who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth , and a day He says: "Be." So it becomes, His saying/words (is) the truth, and to Him (is) the ownership ; a day the horn/bugle be blown into,85(He is) knower (of) the unseen/absent , and the testimony/presence , and He is the wise/judicious, the expert/experienced
And when Abraham said to his father, Azar: "Do you take idols (as) gods? That I see you, and your nation in evident misguidance
And like that We show Abraham the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s ownership/might/power , and to be from the sure/certain
So when the night darkened on him, he saw a star/planet, he said: "That (is) my lord." So when it set/darkened, he said: "I do not like the setting/disappearing
So when he saw the moon, rising/emerging, he said: "That (is) my lord, so when it set/darkened, he said: "If (E) my lord does not guide me, I will be (E) from the nation the misguided
So when he saw the sun rising/emerging, he said: "That (is) my lord, that (is) bigger." So when it set, he said: "You (my) nation, that I am innocent/renouncing from what you share/make partners (with God)
That I aimed/turned my face/front to who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth (as) a submitter/Unifier of God , and I am not from the sharers/makers of partners (with God)
And his nation disputed with him, he said: "Do you argue/dispute with me in God and He had guided me, and I do not fear what you share/make partners (with God) with it, except that my lord wills/wants a thing, my lord spread/enriched every thing (in) knowledge, so do you not think
And how (do) I fear what you shared/made partners (with God), and you (P) (do) not fear that you shared/made partners with God what He did not descend with it on you (from) a proof/evidence ? So which (of) the two groups/parties (is) more worthy with the safety/security if you were knowing
Those who believed and did not confuse/mix/cover their faith/belief with injustice/oppression, (so) those are for them the safety/security, and they are guided
And that (is) Our proof/argument, We gave/brought it (to) Abraham on (to) his nation, We raise steps/stages (of) whom We will/want, that your lord (is) wise/judicious, knowledgeable
And We granted to him Issac, and Jacob, each/all We guided, and Noah We guided from before, and from his descendants (are) David, and Soliman, and Job, and Joseph, and Moses, and Aaron, and like that We reward the good doers
And Zacharias/Zachary, and John, and Jesus, and Elias, all/each (is) from the correct/righteous
And Ishmael, and Elija, and Jonah, and Lot, and each/all We preferred/favoured on the creations altogether/(universes)
And from their fathers/forefathers, and their descendants, and their brothers, and We chose/purified them and We guided them to a straight/direct road/way
That (is) God`s guidance, He guides with it whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves, and if they shared/made partners (with God), what they were making/doing/working would have been wasted/invalidated from them
Those are, those whom We brought to (gave) them The Book and the judgment/rule and the prophethood, so86if those disbelieve with it, so We had entrusted/empowered/appointed a keeper with it, a nation they are not with it disbelieving
Those are, those who God guided, so with their guidance, I follow/imitate (their) example, so I do not ask/demand of you a reward/wage/fee, that truly it is except a remembrance/reminder to the creations altogether/(universes)
And they did not evaluate God His correct/just value/estimation, when they said: "God did not descend on (a) human from a thing." Say: "Who descended The Book which Moses came with it, (as) a light and guidance to the people? You make it papers/parchments, you show it and you hide much, and you were taught/instructed what you did not know, you and nor your fathers/forefathers." Say: "God." Then leave them in their plunging, they play/amuse/enjoy/joke/mock
And that (is) a Book , We descended it blessed, confirming (with) what (is) between his hands, and to warn/give notice (E) (to the) mother/origin of villages (Bekka) and who (is) around/surrounding it, and those who believe with the end (other life), they believe with it, and they are on their prayers observing
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on God lies/falsifications, or he said: "Was inspired/transmitted to me." And was not inspired/transmitted to him a thing, and who said: "I will descend equal/alike (to) what God descended". And if you see/understand when the unjust/oppressors (are) in the death`s/lifelessness` intensities/intoxications, and the angels (are) spreading/extending their hands: "Get your selves out, today you are being rewarded/reimbursed the humiliation`s/disgrace`s torture because (of) what you were saying on (about) God other than the truth , and you were from His verses/evidences/signs being arrogant
And you had come to Us singularly as We created you (the) first time , and you left what We gave you generously behind your backs, and We do not see with you your mediators, those who you claimed that they (are) in you partners (it) had been (E) separated between you, and (it was) wasted from you what you were claiming
That God (is) splitter (of) the seed/grain and the kernel/nucleuses (and) He brings out the live/alive from the dead, and (He is) bringing out the dead from the live/alive, that one (is) God, so how (do) you lie/turn away
Splitter (of) the morning/day break and He made the night tranquillity/security/residence and the sun and the moon counting/calculating, that (is) predestination (of) the glorious/mighty , the knowledgeable
And He is who made/created for you the stars/planets to be guided with it in the shore`s/land`s and the sea`s darknesses, We had detailed/explained the evidences/verses to a nation knowing
And He is who created/formed you from one (F) self, so a settled/established and depository/storage place/womb , We had detailed/explained the evidences/verses to a nation understanding/knowing/learning
And He is who descended from the sky water, so We brought out/made emerge with it every thing`s plant, so We brought out/made emerge from it green, We bring out/make emerge from it seeds/grains overlapping ,and from the palm trees from its first fruit of the season/cover enveloping the fertilizing seed, near branches with87bunches of dates , and treed gardens from grapes, and the olives, and the pomegranate, similar/resembling and not similar/resembling , look/consider to its fruit if/where/when it bears/yields fruit , and its ripeness/darkness, that in that (are) evidences/verses (E) to a nation believing
And they made/created to God partners (from) the Jinns and He created them, and they lied (invented lies) for Him, sons and daughters, without knowledge , His praise/glory! And (He is) high, mighty, exalted and dignified from what they describe/categorize
Creating marvelously without precedent (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, how (could it) be for Him a child, and (there) was not for Him a wife/companion/friend, and He created every thing, and He is with every thing knowledgeable
That one (is) God, your (P) Lord, no God except Him, creator (of) every thing, so worship Him, and He is on every thing a guardian/protector
The eye sights/knowledge do not comprehend/reach Him , and He comprehends/reaches the eye sights/knowledge, and He is the most kind/gracious , the expert/experienced
Clear sightedness had come to you from your (P) Lord, so who saw/understood so to himself, and who blinded so on it, and I am not on you with a protector/observer
And like that We elaborate linguistically the evidences/verses , and to say (P): "You studied/memorized/read." And to clarify/show/explain it to a nation knowing
Follow what was inspired/transmitted to you, from your Lord, no God except Him, and object/turn away from the sharers/takers of partners (with God)
And if God wanted/willed, they would not (have) shared/made partners (with God), and We did not make you a protector/observer on them, and you are not on them with a guardian
And do not insult/abuse/defame those who call from other than God, so they insult/abuse/defame God, transgression/violation without knowledge, like that We decorated/beautified to every nation/generation their work , then to their Lord (is) their return, so He informs them with what they were making/doing
And they swore/made oath by God their oath`s utmost if (E) an evidence/verse came to them they will believe (E) with it, say: "But the verses/evidences (are) at God." And what makes you feel/know, that if it came, they do not believe
And We turn their hearts (minds) and their eye sights/understanding as they did not believe with it (the) first time , and We leave them in their tyranny/arrogance being confused/hesitant
And if that We descended to them the angels, and the deads talked (to) them , and We gathered on them every thing in front, they were not to believe, except that God wants/wills, and but most of them are being ignorant
And like that We made/put to each prophet an enemy (from) the human`s/mankind`s and the Jinn`s devils, some of them inspire/transmit to some the word`s/opinion and belief`s ornament/decoration (as) deceit/temptation, and if your Lord wanted/willed they would not have done it, so leave them and what they fabricate
And to incline to it the hearts (minds of) those who do not believe with the end (other life), and to accept/approve88it, and to commit/perpetrate what they are committing/perpetrating
So is other than God I ask/desire (as) a judge/ruler, and He is who descended to you The Book detailed/explained ? And those who We brought (gave) to them The Book , they know that it (is) descended from your Lord with the truth , so do not be (E) from the doubting/arguing
And your Lord`s word/expression (was/is) completed truthfully and justly/equitably, (there is) no exchanger/replacer to His words/expressions, and He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable
And if you obey (follow) most of who (is) in the earth, they misguide you from God`s way/path , that they follow except the assumption/suspicion , and that they (are) except lying/speculating
That your Lord, He is more knowing (about) who misguides from His way/path , and He is more knowing with the guided
So eat from what God`s name was mentioned on it, if you where with His verses/evidences believing
And how (why) for you that you not eat from what God`s name was mentioned on it, and He had detailed/explained for you what He forbade on you, except what you were forced to it, and that many misguide (E) with their self attractions for desires without knowledge, that your Lord, He is more knowing with (about) the transgressors
And leave (the) apparent/visible (of) the sin/crime, and its hidden/secret , that those who acquire/carry the sin/crime, they will be rewarded/reimbursed with what they were fabricating
And do not eat/consume from what God`s name was not mentioned on it, and that it truly is debauchery (E) , and that the devils inspire/transmit (E) to their patrons/supporters to argue/dispute with you, and if you obeyed them, that you are (then) sharers/takers of partners (with God) (E)
Is who was/is dead/lifeless, so We revived him and We made/put for him a light he walks with it in (between) the people, as who his example (is) in the darknesses (and he) is not with getting out from it? Like that (it) was decorated/beautified to the disbelievers what they were making/doing
And like that We made/put in every village/urban city its greatest/bigger criminals/sinners to cheat/deceive in it, and they do not cheat/deceive except with themselves, and they do not feel/know
And if an evidence/verse came to them, they said: "We will never/not believe until we be given/brought similar/equal/alike (to) what was given/brought (to) God`s messengers." God (is) more knowing where/when He makes/puts His message, those who committed a sin/crime will be struck/marked (with) humiliation/lowliness/subservience at God, and strong (severe) torture because (of) what they were cheating/deceiving
So who God wants/wills that He guides him, He expands his chest to the Islam/submission (to God), and who He wants/wills that He misguides him, He makes his chest narrow/tight , a tightness/strain/sin , as if (he) ascends in the sky/space, like that God makes/puts the obscenity/punishment and torture on those who do not believe
And that (is) your Lord`s straight/direct road/way , We had detailed/explained the verses/evidences to a nation mentioning/remembering
For them the safety`s/security`s home at their Lord, and He is their guardian/victorior because (of) what they were doing
And a day (when) He gathers them all together , you the Jinn`s race , you had become more than the human , and their allies/patrons from the human said: "Our Lord, some of us enjoyed with some (of them) and we reached our term/time that You delayed for us." He said: "The fire (is) your residence , (you are) immortally in it except what (who) God wanted/willed, that your Lord (is) wise/judicious, knowledgeable
And like that We appoint/enable some (of) the unjust/oppressors (over) some, because (of) what they (were) earning/gathering
You the Jinn`s and the human`s race , did not messengers from you come to you, they relay/inform on you My verses/evidences and warn you (of) this your day`s/time`s meeting (your meeting at this day/time)? They said: "We witnessed/testified on our selves." And the life the present/worldly life had deceived/tempted them, and they witnessed/testified on themselves that they were disbelieving
That (is) that your Lord was not destroying the villages/urban cities with injustice, and its people (are) ignoring/disregarding
And for each steps/stages/degrees from what they made/did, and your Lord is not with ignoring/neglecting about what they make/do
And your Lord (is) the rich (owner of) the mercy, if He wants/wills He wipes you off , and makes a successor from after you, what He wills/wants, as He created you from another nation`s descendants
That what you are being promised is coming (E), and you are not with disabling/frustrating (it)
Say: "You (my) nation, do/work at your capacity that I am doing/working, so you will know who (is to) be for him the home`s end/turn (result), that He does not make the unjust/oppressors succeed/win
And they made/created to God from what He created/seeded from the agricultural land/plants and the camels/livestock a share , so they said: "That (is) to God." with their claims/pretensions , "And that (is) to our partners (with God)." So what (was) to their partners (with God) so it does not reach to God, and what was to God, so it reaches to their partners (with God), it was bad/evil what they judge/rule
And like that their partners (with God) decorated/beautified to many of the takers of partners (with God) killing/murdering their children, to make them be destroyed/perished , and to confuse/mix on them their religion, and if God willed/wanted they would not have done it, so leave them, and what they are fabricating
And they said: "Those camels/livestock, and cultivation/plantation (are) prohibited, no (one) eats it except whom we will/want." With their claims/pretensions , and camels/livestock its backs were forbidden ,and camels/livestock they do not mention/remember God`s name on it, fabrication on Him, He will reward/reimburse them because (of) what they were fabricating
And they said: "What (is) in these camels`/livestock`s` bellies/insides (are) clearly/purely to our males and forbidden on our wives/spouses." And if (it) was dead , so they are in it partners, he will reward/reimburse90them (equal to) their description/categorization, that He (is) wise/judicious, knowledgeable
Those who killed their children ignorantly/foolishly without knowledge, had lost/misguided and perished, and they forbade/prohibited what God provided for them, fabrication on God, they had misguided, and they were not guided
And He is who created trellised treed gardens/paradises and not trellised, and the palm trees, and the plants its food/fruits (are) different, and the olives, and the pomegranate, similar and not similar , eat from its fruit if it bore its fruit, and give its share (on the) day/time (of) its harvest/gathering, and do not spoil/waste , that He does not love/like the spoilers/wasters
And from the camels/livestock carriers/burdeners , and spreaders , eat from what God provided for you, and do not follow the devil`s foot steps, that he (is) for you a clear/evident enemy
Eight pairs , from the sheep two, and from the goats two, say: "Are the two males forbidden or the two females, but (or what) in the two females` wombs/uteruses contained/included on (in) it? Inform me with knowledge if you were truthful
And from the camels two, and from the cows two, say: "Are the two males forbidden or the two females, but (or what) the two females` wombs/uteruses contained/included on (in) it? Or where you witnesses/testifiers if God directed/commanded you with that? So who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on (about) God lies/falsifications to misguide the people without knowledge?" That God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive
Say: "I do not find in what (was) inspired/transmitted to me forbidden on an eater/taster (that) he eats/tastes it, except that (it) be dead (animal) or poured/shed blood, or a pig`s/swine`s flesh/meat, so it truly is filth (an) atrocious act or debauchery was declared/praised the name of whom the sacrifice was made for to other than God with it, so who was forced, not transgressing/corrupting and nor transgressing/violating , so then your Lord (is) forgiving, merciful
And on those who repented/guided/(the Jews), We forbade every (thing) of nails/claws , and from the cows and the sheep and goats , We forbade on them their (B)`s fat/grease, except what their (B)`s backs bore , or the intestines/guts , or what (was) mixed/mingled with bones, that We rewarded/reimbursed them because of their oppression/transgression, and We are truthful (E)
So if they denied you , so say: "Your Lord (is owner) of abundant mercy, and His might/power is not to be returned from the nation the criminals/sinners
Those who shared/made partners (with God) will say: "If God wanted/willed, we would not (have) made partners (with God), and nor our fathers, and nor forbade from a thing." Like that those from before them lied/denied until they tasted/experienced Our might/power , say: "Is at you from knowledge, so you bring it out for us? That you follow except the assumption/suspicion, and that truly you are except lying/speculating
Say: "To God (is) the eloquent, the proof/argument, so if He wanted/willed, He would have guided you all/altogether
Say: "Come/bring your witnesses/testifiers, those who witness/testify that God forbade this." So if they witnessed/testified, so do not witness/testify with them and do not follow (the) self attractions for desires (of) those who denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences , and those who do not believe with the end (other life), and they are with their Lord are making equals
Say: "Come I (will) read/recite what your Lord forbade on you, that do not make partners with Him (in) a thing, and with the parents (treat with) goodness, and do not kill your children from poverty We provide for you and them, and do not approach/near the enormous/atrocious deeds , what is visible from it, and what is hidden, and do not kill the self that God forbade, except with the right , that He directed/commanded you with it, maybe you reason/comprehend
And do not approach/near the orphan`s property/possession except with which it is best, until he reaches his maturity/strength, and fulfill/complete the measuring/weighing device, and the scale with the just/equitable, We do not burden a self except its endurance/capacity, and if you said (talked), so be just/equitable, and even if (it) was (against) of the relations/near, and with God`s promise/contract fulfill/complete; that He directed/commanded with it, maybe you mention/remember
And that, that (is) My straight/direct road/path, so follow it, and do not follow the roads/paths, so it separates (divides) with you from His road/path, that He directed/commanded you with it, maybe you fear and obey (God)
Then We brought/gave Moses The Book complete on that (what is) best detailing/explaining to every thing, and guidance, and mercy, maybe they believe with their Lord`s meeting
And this Book , We descended it blessed, so follow it, and fear and obey (God), maybe you attain mercy
That you say: "But The Book was descended on two groups from before us, and that we were about their studies/readings ignoring/disregarding (E)
Or you say: "If (only) that The Book was descended on us, we would have been more guided than them." So an evidence had come to you from your Lord, and guidance, and mercy, so who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who denied/falsified with God`s verses/evidences and discouraged/turned away from it? We will reward/reimburse those who discourage/turn away from Our verses/evidences the torture`s evil/harm ,because (of) what they were discouraging/turning away
Do they wait except that the angels come to them , or your Lord comes, or some (of) your Lord`s verses/evidences come? (On) a day/time some (of) your Lord`s verses/evidences come, a self`s belief does not benefit (it) if it was (had) not believed from before, or gained goodness in its belief, say: "Wait/watch , We are waiting/watching
That those who separated (divided) their religion, and were groups/parties , you are not from them in a thing, but their matter/affair (is) to God, then He informs them with what they were making/doing
Who came/did with the goodness, so to him ten similars/equals to it, and who came/did with the sin/crime, so he will not be rewarded/reimbursed except similar/equal to it, and they are not being caused injustice/oppression to
Say: "That I (E), my Lord (had) guided me to (a) straight/direct road/way (a) straight/valuable 92religion, Abraham`s religion/faith, Unifier of God , and he was not from the sharers/takers of partners (with God)
Say: "That my prayers and my rituals or methods of worship , and my life, and my death/time of death, (is) to the creations altogether`s/(universes`) Lord
No partner to Him, and with that I was ordered/commanded, and I am first (of) the Moslems/submitters/surrenderers
Say: "Is other than God I desire (as) a Lord, and He is Lord (of) every thing, and every self does not earn/gather except on it, and no sinner/burdener carries/bears (the) load/weight (of) another, then to your Lord (is) your return, so He informs you with what you were in it differing/disagreeing
And He is who made/created you the earth`s/Planet Earth`s successors and replacers/leaders , and He rose some of you above/over some (by) steps/stages/degrees, to test you in what He gave you, that your Lord (is) quick (in) the punishment, and that He (is) forgiving (E), merciful
A L M S/C
A Book was descended to you so no tightness/strain be in your chest (innermost) from it, to warn/give notice with it and a remembrance/reminder to the believers
Follow what was descended to you from your Lord, and do not follow from other than Him guardians ,little (is) what you remember/glorify
And how many from a village/urban city We destroyed it , so Our might/power came to it suddenly at night/overnight, or (while) they are saying/relaxing at midday
So their call/prayer when/if Our might/power came to them was not except that they said: "We were unjust/oppressive
So We will ask/question (E) those sent to them, and We will ask/question (E) the messengers
So We will inform/narrate on (to) them with knowledge and We were not absent
And the weight/measure that day (is) the correct/deserved/just , so who his (whose) weights/measures became heavy, so those, they are the successful/winners
And who his (whose) weights/measures were reduced/lightened, so those (are) those who lost themselves because (of) what they were with Our signs/verses/evidences causing injustice/oppression
And We had strengthened/empowered you in the earth/Planet Earth, and We made for you in it livelihood/sustenance, little (is) what you thank/be grateful
And We had created you, then We pictured/formed you , then We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam." So they prostrated except Satan , was not from the prostrating
He (God) said: "What prevented/stopped/forbid you, that you not prostrate when/if I ordered/commanded you?" He (the devil)said: "I am better than him, You created me from fire, and You created him from mud/clay
He (God) said: "So drop/reduce/decline from it, so (it) was not to be for you that you be arrogant in it, so get out/emerge , that you are from the subservient/humiliated/lowly
He (the devil) said: "Give me time/delay me to a day they be sent/resurrected/revived
He (God) said: "That you are from the given time/delayed
He (the devil) said: "So with what you misguided/enticed me , I will sit/remain (E) for them (in) Your straight/direct road/way
Then I will come to them from between their hands, and from behind them, and from/of/on their rights, and from/of/on their lefts, and You (will) not find most of them thankful/grateful
He (God) said: "Get out/emerge from it expelled/degraded , expelled/driven away , whom (E) followed you from them, I will fill (E) Hell from you all/all together (E)
And you Adam, reside/inhabit you and your wife/spouse the Paradise, so you (B) eat from (it) where/when you (B) willed/wanted, and do not approach/near this/that the tree, so you (B) become/will be from the unjust/oppressive
So the devil talked to/gave evil suggestions and temptations to them (B) to show to them (B) what was hidden/concealed from them (B) from their (B)`s shameful genital private parts, and he said: "Your (B)`s Lord did not prevent you (B) from that/this tree except that you (B) become/be two angels or you (B) become/be from the immortal/eternal
And he swore/made oath to them (B): "I am to you (B) from (E) the advisors/counselors
So he lured/attracted and lowered them (B) , with deceit/temptation so when they (B) tasted/experienced the tree, their (B)`s shameful genital private parts appeared to them (B), and they (B) started and continued (to) stick/tried hard to make do with what they do not have on them (B) from the Paradise`s leaves , and their (B)`s Lord called them (B): "Did I not forbid/prevent you (B) from that the tree, and I said to you (B) that the devil (is) for you (B) an evident enemy
They (B) said: "Our Lord, We caused injustice/oppressed ourselves, and if You do not forgive for us, and You have mercy upon us, we will be/become from the losers
He said: "Drop/descend/reduce some of you to some (are) an enemy, and for you in the earth/Planet Earth (is) settlement/establishment and long life/enjoyment to a time
He said: "In it you live, and in it you die, and from it you are brought out
You Adam`s sons and daughters, We had descended on you a cover/dress (that) hides/conceals your shameful genital private parts, and feathers/riches/possessions, and the fear and obedience (of God`s) cover/dress, that (is) better , and that (is) from God`s signs/verses/evidences, maybe/perhaps they remember/glorify
You Adam`s sons and daughters, (let) not the devil test/misguide/betray you as/like he brought out your parents from the Paradise, he removes/pulls away from them (B) their (B)`s cover/dress to show them (B)/make them (B) understand their (B)`s shameful genital private parts; that he sees you, he and his group/tribe from where/when you do not see them, that We made the devils guardians/allies to those who do not believe
And if they made/did an enormous/atrocious deed , they said: "We found our fathers on it, and God ordered/commanded us with it." Say: "That God does not order/command with the enormous/atrocious deeds , do you say on (about) God what you do not know
Say: "My Lord ordered/commanded with the just/equitable, and stand your faces/fronts at every mosque/place of worshipping God, and call Him faithful/loyal to Him (in) the religion, as/like He started/created you , you return
A group/party , He guided, and a group/party (it) became fact/deserved/imminent on them the misguidance, that they took the devils (as) guardians/allies from other than God, and they think/suppose that they are guided
You Adam`s sons and daughters, take/receive your decoration/beauty at every/each mosque/place of worshipping God, and eat and drink and do not waste/spoil/ignore , that God does not love/like the wasters
Say: "Who forbid God`s decoration/beauty/ornament which He brought out to (for) His worshippers/slaves, and the enjoyable/goodnesses from the provision/things of benefit or value ?"Say: "It is to those who believed in the life the present/worldly life clearly/purely (in) the Resurrection Day, as/like that We detail/explain/clarify the verses/evidences to a nation knowing
Say: "But my Lord forbade the enormous/atrocious deeds what is/became visible from it, and what is/was hidden, and the sin/crime, and the oppression/transgression/corruption without the right , and that you share/make partners (with God) what He did not descend with it a proof/evidence , and that you say on (about) God what you do not know
And to every nation (is) a term/time, so if their term/time came, they do not delay/lag behind an hour, and they do not advance
You Adam`s sons and daughters, if/whenever messengers from you come to you, they narrate/relay/inform on (to) you My verses/evidences , so who feared and obeyed and corrected/repaired , so no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving
And those who lied/denied/falsified, with Our verses/evidences and they became arrogant from it, those are the fire`s owners/company/friends, they are in it immortally/eternally
So who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on (about) God lies/denials/falsifications or lied/denied/falsified with His verses/evidences , those their share/fortune from The Book takes them until/if/when Our messengers came to them, they make them die, they said: "Where (is) what you were/are calling/wishing/desiring from other than God?" They said: "They were misguided from us, and they witnessed/testified on themselves that they truly, they were disbelieving/disbelievers
He said: "Enter in (with) nations (that) have past/expired from before you from the Jinns and the human/mankind in the fire, whenever a nation is entered, it cursed its sister until they caught up (to)/overtook/reached each other in it all together, their last said to their first : "Our Lord those (are who) misguided us, so give/bring them a double torture from the fire." He said: "For every/each/all (is) double, and but you do not know
And their first said to their last: "So (there) was/is not was for you on us from grace/favour/blessing, so taste/experience the torture because (of) what you were gaining/acquiring
That those who lied/denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences and became arrogant from/about it, the sky`s/space`s doors/entrances do not be (get) opened for them, and nor they enter the Paradise, until the camel enters/penetrates in the needle`s/sewing needle`s eye/threading hole, and as/like that We reward/reimburse the criminals/sinners
For them from Hell (is a) bed/crib , and from above them covers/darknesses , and as/like that We reward/reimburse the unjust/oppressors
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, We do not burden/impose a self except its endurance/capacity , those are the Paradises` owners/company , they are in it immortally/eternally
And We removed/took away what (is) in their chests (innermosts) from hatred/spite/animosity , the rivers flow from beneath them , and they said: "The praise/gratitude/thanks (is) to God who guided us to this, and we were not to (be) guided had it not been for that God guided us. Our Lord`s messengers had come with the truth ." And they (those who believed) were called: "That (is) the Paradise you were made to inherit it becuase (of) what you were making/doing/working
And the Paradises` owners/company called/cried (to) the fire`s owners/company: "That we had found what our Lord promised us truthful/factually , so did you find what your Lord promised truthfully/factually ?" They said: "Yes." So an announcer/informer (from) between them announced/informed : "That God`s curse/torture (is) on the unjust/oppressors
Those who prevent/obstruct from God`s way/path and they desire it (be) bent/crookedness , and they are with the end (other life) disbelieving
And between them (B) (is) a partition/barrier/protection , and on the fence between Heaven and Hell/the highest tip of anything (are) men they know each/all with (by) their marks/identifications/expressions, and they called/cried (to) the Paradises` company/friends : "That a greeting/security/peace on you." They did not enter it and they are coveting/desiring
And if their eye sights/understanding was diverted towards the fire`s company/friends , they said: "Our Lord do not make/put us with the nation the unjust/oppressive
And company/friends (of) the fence between Heaven and Hell/the highest tip of anything called/cried (to) men (that) they know them by their marks/identifications/expressions. They said: "Your gatherings/collecting/group and what you were being arrogant did not enrich/satisfy from you
Are those, those who you swore/made oath (that) God will not take/receive them with a mercy? Enter the Paradise, no fear/fright on you and nor you be sad/grieving
And the fire`s company/friends called/cried (to) the Paradises` company/friends : "That spread/flow on us from the water or from what God provided for you." They said: "That God forbade/prohibited them (B) on the disbelievers
Those who took their religion (as) an amusement/fun and playing/mockery and the life the present/worldly life has deceived/tempted them, so the day/today We forget them as/like they forgot this their day/time, and as long as (because of) what they were with Our verses/evidences disbelieving and denying
And We had come to them with a Book (that) We detailed/explained it on knowledge ,guidance and mercy to a nation believing
Do they wait/watch except (for) its interpretation/explanation? (On) a day its interpretation/explanation comes, those who forgot it from before say: "Our Lord`s messengers had come with the truth . So are99(there) for us from mediators, so they mediate for us, or we be returned so we make/do other than what we were making/doing?" They had lost themselves, and what they were fabricating/cutting and splitting (was) misguided/wasted/lost from them
That your Lord (is) God who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth in six days/times, then He aimed to/sat on/straightened on the throne/royal bed/palace , the daytime covers/darkens the night, it seeks/wants it quickly/urgently , and the sun and the moon and the stars/planets (are) manipulated/subjugated with His order/command, is (it) not to Him the creation and the order/command/matter/affair? Blessed (is) God the creatures all together`s/(universes`) Lord
Call your Lord humbly and humiliated and hiddenly/secretly, that He does not love/like the transgressors/violators
And do not corrupt/disorder in the earth/Planet Earth after its correction/repairment, and call Him fearfully/frightfully wishing/coveting , that God`s mercy (is) near/close from the good doers
And He is who sends the winds/breezes a good news between His mercy`s hand, until when it carried/raised heavy loaded clouds, We drove it to a dead country/land , So We descended with it the water, so We brought out with it from every the fruits, as/like that We bring out/make (to) emerge the deads, maybe/perhaps you mention/remember/glorify
And the good/pure country/land its plants appear/emerge with its Lord`s permission , and which became (was) bad/spoiled , does not appear/emerge except very little/useless/weak, as/like that We elaborate linguistically (explain in detail) the verses/evidences to a nation thinking/being grateful
We had sent Noah to his nation, so he said: "My nation worship God, (there) is not a God for you from other than Him, that I, I fear on (for) you a great day`s torture
The nobles/assembly from his nation said: "We , we are seeing you (E) in evident misguidance
He said: "My nation, (there) is not misguidance with me, and but I am a messenger from the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
I communicate/deliver to you my Lord`s messages, and I advise to you, and I know from God what you do not now
Are you astonished/surprised that a reminder came to you from your Lord on a man from you to warn/give you notice, and to fear and obey (E), and maybe/perhaps you attain mercy
So they denied Him , so We saved/rescued him and those with him in the ship , and We drowned/sunk those who denied with Our verses/evidences , that they truly were a blind/confused/misguided nation
And to Aad/an ancient tribe that could have been Hegaz, (We sent) their brother Hood, he said: "My nation worship God, (there is) no God for you from other than Him, so do you not fear and obey
The nobles/assembly , those who disbelieved from his nation said: "That We , we (are) seeing/understanding you (E) in ignorance/stupidity , and (that) we suspect you (E) are from the disbelievers
He said: "My nation (there) is no ignorance/stupidity with me, and but I (am) a messenger from the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
I communicate/inform you (with) my Lord`s messages, and I am for you (a) faithful/loyal advisor/counselor
Are you astonished/surprised , that a reminder came to you from your Lord on a man from you to warn/give you notice, and remember when He made/put you (as) successors and replacers/top leaders from after Noah`s nation, and He increased you in the creation`s expansion/abundance/wealth , so remember God`s blessings, maybe/ perhaps you succeed/win
They said: Did you come to us to worship God alone, and we leave (discard) what our fathers were worship(ping), so come/bring to us with what you promise us, if you were from the truthful
He said: "Punishment and torture and anger from your Lord had fallen/landed on you, do you argue/dispute with me in (about) names you named it, you and your fathers, (that) God did not descend with it from a proof/evidence ? So wait/watch , that I am with you from the waiting/expecting/watching
So We saved/rescued him and those with him with a mercy from Us, and We cut off/severed (the) root/remainder (of) those who disbelieved with Our verses/evidences , and they were not believers/believing
And to Thamud/a pre-Islamic Arab tribe that could have been in Hegaz, (We sent) their brother Saleh, he said: "My nation, worship God, (there) is no God for you from other than Him, an evidence had come to you from your Lord, this (is) God`s female camel for you (as) a sign/evidence , so leave it eat in God`s ground/earth/land, and do not touch it with evil/harm , so (then a) painful torture takes/punishes you
And remember when He made/put you (as) successors and replacers/top leaders from after Aad/an ancient tribe that could have been in Hegaz, and He settled/established you in the earth/Planet Earth, you take from its plains/flat and level lands castles/palaces/mansions and you carve out/hew the mountains (into) houses/homes, so remember God`s blessings, and do not corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth corrupting/disordering
The nobles/assembly , those who became arrogant from his nation said to those who were weakened to who believed from them: "Do you know that Saleh is sent from his Lord?" They Said: "We are with what (he) is sent with believing
Those who became arrogant said: "We are with what you believed with it disbelieving
So they wounded/slaughtered/made the female camel infertile and they became arrogant/disobedient from their Lord`s order/command, and they said: "You Saleh, come/bring to us with what you promise us if you are from the messengers
So the tremble and shake/quake punished/took them, so they became/became in the morning in their home/country/place stuck to the ground (dead)
So he turned away from them and he said: "My nation, I had communicated/informed (to) you my Lord`s message, and I advised to you, and but you do not love/like the advisors/counselors
And Lot when he said to his nation: "Do you commit the enormous/atrocious deed , (that) not from one/anyone from the creations all together/(universes) did not precede you with it
That you are coming/doing the men (with) lust/desire/craving from other than the women, but you are a nation (of) spoilers/wasters/extravagators
And His nation`s answer/replay was not except that they said: "Bring/drive them out from your village/urban city, that they truly are people purifying
So We saved/rescued him and his family/people except his woman (wife) was from the remaining behind
And We rained on them rain, so see/wonder about how was the criminals`/sinners` end/turn (result)
And to Madya/an ancient city, that could have been by the Red Sea, (We sent) their brother Shu`aib, he said: "My nation, worship God, (there is) no God for you from other than Him, an evidence had come to you from your Lord, so fulfill/complete the measuring/weighing device, and the scale/measuring instrument , and do not reduce/cheat the people (from) their things, and do not corrupt/disorder in the earth/Planet Earth, (from) after its correction/repairment, that (is) better for you, if you were believing
And do not sit/remain with every road/way, you promise and you object/prevent/obstruct who believed with it from God`s way/road and you wish/desire it (be) bent/crookedness/indirectness, and remember when/where you where little/few , so He increased you, and see/wonder about how was the corruptings`/disorderings` end/turn (result)
And if (there) was a group of people from you (that) believed with what I was sent with it and a group of people did not believe, so be patient until God judges/rules between us, and He is the judges`/rulers` best
The nobles/assembly, those who became arrogant from his nation said: "We will bring/drive you out (E) you Shu`aib and those who believed with you from our village/urban city or you return (E) in our religion/faith." He said: "Or even if we were hating (it)
We had fabricated on God lies/falsification , if we returned in your religion/faith after when God saved/rescued us from it, and (it) is not to be for us that we return in it except if that God, our Lord, wills/wants, our Lord extended/spread (over) every thing (in) knowledge, on God We relied/surrendered to ; our Lord judge between us and between our nation with the truth , and you are the victoriors`/defeators`/judges` best
And the nobles/assembly, those who disbelieved from his nation said: "If (E) you followed Shu`aib, that you are then losers (E)
So the tremble/shake/quake punished/took them so they became/became in the morning in their home/country/place stuck to the ground (dead)
Those who denied Shu`aib were as if/as though they did not inhabit it/enrich/avail in it, those who denied Shu`aib were, they were the losers
So he turned away from them, and he said: "My nation, I had communicated/informed you my Lord`s messages, and I advised to you, so how (do) I grieve/sorrow for on a nation disbelieving
And We did not sent in a village/urban city from a prophet except We took its people with the misery/hardships , and the calamity/disastrous distress, maybe/perhaps they become humble and humiliate themselves
Then We exchanged/substituted (in) place/position (of) the sin/crime the good/goodness, until they cure/forgave/pardoned, and they said: "The calamity/disastrous distress and the prosperity had touched our fathers." So We took/punished them suddenly/unexpectedly, and (while) they are not feeling/knowing/sensing
And if that the villages`/urban cities` peoples believed and feared and obeyed, We would have opened/eased on them blessings from the sky/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and but they denied/falsified , so We took/punished them because (of)what they were acquiring/gathering
Did the villages`/urban cities` people trust that Our might/power comes to them overnight and (while) they are sleeping/slumbering
Or did the villages`/urban cities` people trust that Our might/power comes to them at sunrise/daybreak/forenoon and (while) they are playing/amusing
Did they secure God`s scheme/deceit ? So no(one) trusts God`s scheme/deceit except the nation the losers
Or did He not guide to those inheriting the earth/Planet Earth from after its people , that if We will/want, We struck/marked them because of their crimes, and We stamp/cover/seal on their hearts/minds , so they do not hear/listen
Those are the villages`/urban cities`, We narrate/inform on (to) you from its information/news, and their messengers had come to them with the evidences, so they were not to believe with what they denied/falsified from before, as/like that God stamps/covers/seals on the disbelievers` hearts/minds
And We did not find to most of them from a promise/contract , and that truly We found most of them debauchers (E)
Then We sent from after them Moses with Our verses/evidences , to Pharaoh, and his nobles/assembly, so they caused injustice/oppression with it, so see/wonder about how was the corruptings`/disrepairings` end/turn (result)
And Moses said: "You Pharaoh, I am a messenger from the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
Truthful (careful/faithful) on (that) I do not say on (about) God except the truth , I had come to you with an evidence from your Lord, so send with me Israel`s sons and daughters
He said: "If you were came (you had come) with an evidence/sign , so come with it, if you were from the truthful
So he threw away/threw his stick/cane, so then it is (an) evident/clear snake
And he removed/pulled his hand, so then it is white to the lookers/watchers . (DOES THIS MEAN THAT MOSES WAS A BLACK MAN)
The nobles/assembly from Pharaoh`s nation said: "That truly that (is a) knowledgeable magician/sorcerer (E)
He wants that he brings you out from your land , so what (do) you order/command
They said: "Delay/postpone him and his brother and send in the cities/towns gatherers
They come to you with every knowledgeable magician/sorcerer
And the magicians/sorcerers came (to) Pharaoh, and they said: "That truly for us (is) a reward/fee (E) if we, we were the defeators
He said: "Yes, and that you are from (E) the neared/closer
They said: "You Moses, either that you throw/throw away, or we, we be the throwing/throwing away
He said: "Throw/throw away." So when they threw/threw away, they bewitched/enchanted the people`s eyes/sights and they terrorized/terrified them, and they came with great magic/sorcery. (IF GOD REFEREED TO THE MAGIC AS "GREAT" THEN IT MUST REALLY HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY BY ANY STANDARD)
And We inspired/transmitted/signaled to Moses, that throw/throw away your stick/cane, so then it snatches/swallows quickly what they lie/falsify
So the truth fell/happened , and what they were making/doing (was) wasted/canceled
So they were defeated/overcome at that place and time, and they turned (became) submissive/subservient
And the magicians/sorcerers were thrown/thrown away prostrating
They said: "We believed with the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
Moses` and Aaron`s Lord
Pharaoh said: "You believed with Him, before that I permit for you? That, that (is) cheatery/deceit (E) you schemed/cheated/deceived it in the city/town to bring out from it its people , so you will/shall know
I will cut off/amputate (E) your hands and your feet from opposites , then I will crucify you/place you on crosses all/all together. ("OPPOSITES" MEANS A RIGHT HAND AND A LEFT FOOT, OR A LEFT HAND AND A RIGHT FOOT)
They said: "We are to our Lord returning
And you do not revenge/hate/criticize from us except that we believed with our Lord`s evidences/verses/signs, when (it) came to us, our Lord pour on us patience, and make us die (as) Moslems/submitters/surrenderers
And the nobles/assembly from Pharaoh`s nation said: "Do you leave Moses and his nation to corrupt/disorder in the earth/Planet Earth, and he leaves you and your gods?" He said: "We will kill their sons and shame/keep alive their women, and we are above/over them defeating/conquering
Moses said to his nation: "Seek help/support/assistance by (from) God, and be patient, that the earth/land/Planet Earth (is) to God, He makes whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves inherit it, and the end (result is) to the fearing and obeying (God)
They said: "We were mildly harmed from before that you came to us, and from after what you came to us." He said: "Maybe/perhaps (hopefully) your Lord, that He destroys/perishes your enemy and He makes you successors in the earth/Planet Earth/land, so He sees/watches how you do/work
And We had taken Pharaoh`s family with the years (drought), and reduction (deficiency) from the fruits, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember
So if the good/goodness came to them, they said: "This (is) for us." And if a sin/crime hits/strikes them , they get (have) a bad omen with Moses and whom (is) with him. Is it not, but their bad omen (is) at God, and but most of them do not know
And they said: "whatever you come/bring to us with it, from an evidence/sign/verse to bewitch/enchant us with it, so we are not to you with believing
So We sent on them the deadly/great flood/excess , and the grasshoppers/locusts and the lice, and the frogs and the blood, explained/clarified evidences/signs for them, so they became arrogant, and they were a nation (of) criminals/sinners
And when the filth/torture fell on them, they said: "You Moses, call for us your Lord, with what He promised/pledged at you, if (E) you removed/uncovered (relieved) the filth/torture from us, we will believe (E) to you, and we will send (E) with you Israel`s sons and daughters
So when We removed/uncovered (relieved) from them the filth/torture to a term/time they, they are reaching it, then they are breaching/violating
So We revenged/punished from them, so We drowned/sunk them in the body of water (river/sea/lake) because they denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences , and they were from it ignoring/disregarding
And We made the nation, those who were being weakened inherit the earth`s/Planet Earth`s sun rises/easts, and its sunsets , that We blessed in it, and your Lord`s word/expression the good (is) completed on Israel`s sons and daughters because (of) what they were patient, and We destroyed what Pharaoh and his nation were making/producing , and what they were building of trellised or wooden buildings/raising/supporting/inhabiting
And We made with Israel`s sons and daughters cross/pass through the large body of water (sea/ocean) , so they came/passed by on a nation occupying themselves/adhering on (to) idolized or worshipped idols/statues for them, they said: "You Moses, make/create for us a god, as/like (there are) gods for them." He said: "That you are a nation being lowly/ignorant/foolish
That those what they are in it (is) destroyed/ruined/broken, and what they were making/doing is being wasted/annulled
He said: "Is other than God a god I wish/desire (for) you, and He preferred/favoured you over the creations all together/(universes)
And if We saved/rescued you from Pharaoh`s family, they humiliate/impose upon you the punishment`s evil/harm , they kill your sons and they shame/keep alive your women, and in that (is) a great test from your Lord
And We promised Moses thirty nights, and We completed it with ten, so his Lord`s appointed time/appointed time or place completed forty nights, and Moses said to his brother Aaron, "Be my successor in my nation, and correct/repair/reconciliate and do not follow the corrupting`s way/path
And when Moses came to Our appointed time/appointed time or place, and his Lord conversed/spoke (to) him, he said: "My Lord show me/make me understand, I look/see to you." He said: "You will never/not see me, and but/however look to the mountain , so if it settled/established/affixed (in) its place/position, so you will/shall see me." So when his Lord uncovered/revealed/shined to the mountain, He made it crushed/destroyed/leveled/flattened, and Moses fell down fainting from thunderous noise/thunderstruck, so when he recovered/woke up, he said: "Your praise/glory, I repented to you, and I am first (of) the believers
He said: "You Moses, that I, I chose/purified you, over the people with My messages, and with My speech/conversation/languages, so take/receive what I gave/brought you, and be from the thankful/grateful
And We wrote/decreed for him in the tablets/sheets from every thing a sermon/advice/warning and detailing/explaining to every thing, so take/receive it with power/strength and order/command your nation (to) take/receive with its best, I will show you/make you understand the debauchers` home/house
I will send away/divert/misguide from My verses/evidences those who are being arrogant in the earth/Planet Earth, without the right , and if they see/understand every verse/evidence, they do not believe with it, and if they see/understand the correct/right guidance way/path , they do not take it (as) a way/path, and if they see/understand the misguidance`s/failure`s way/path they take/receive it (as) a way/path, that (is) because they (E), they lied/denied (rejected) with Our evidences/verses, and they were from it ignoring/neglecting/disregarding
And those who denied with Our verses/evidences, and the end`s (other life`s) meeting, their deeds (were) wasted; are they being rewarded/reimbursed except (for) what they were making/doing
And Moses` nation took/received from after him from their jewel/ornament/decoration a calf`s body, for him (a) moo/bellow; do they not see/understand that it does not converse/speak/talk (to) them, and nor guide them a way/road/path ? They took/received it, and they were unjust/oppressive
And when it was wronged/confused/regretted in their hands, and they saw/understood that they had been misguided, they said: "If (E) our Lord does not have mercy upon us, and forgive for us we will be/become (E) from the losers
And when Moses returned to his nation angry sorrowfully/angrily, he said: "How bad you succeeded/followed me from after me, did you hurry/hasten/rush your Lord`s order/command?" And he threw the tablets/sheets , and he took with his brother`s head/top pulling/dragging him to him, he said: "Son (of my) mother, that the nation weakened me, and they were about to/almost (to) kill me, so do not make the enemies rejoice at my misfortune, and do not make me with the nation the unjust/oppressive
He said: "My Lord, forgive for me and to my brother and enter us in Your mercy, and You are most merciful (of) the merciful
That those who took/received the calf, anger from their Lord will take/receive/obtain them, and humiliation/disgrace in the life the present/worldly life, and like that We reward/reimburse the fabricators
And those who made/did the sins/crimes, then they repented from after it, and they believed, that your Lord (is) from after it forgiving (E), merciful
And when the anger quietened from Moses, he took/received the tablets/sheets , and in its transcription/duplicate/print (is) guidance and mercy to those who to their Lord they are awed/terrified/monastic/monkish
And Moses chose (from) his nation seventy men, to Our appointed time/appointed time or place, so when the tremble and shake/quake/agitation took/punished them, he said: "My Lord, if you willed/wanted you made them die/destroyed them from before and (as well as) me, do you make us die/destroy us because (of) what the ignorant/foolish from us make/did? That it is except Your test , You misguide with it whom You will/want, and You guide whom You will/want, You are our guardian/patron , so forgive for us, and have mercy upon us, and You are best (of) the forgiving
And decree for us in this the present world goodness and in the end (other life), we have, we repented/guided to You. He said: "My torture, I strike/mark who I will/want with it, and My mercy extended/enriches every thing, so I will decree to those who fear and obey, and give/bring the charity/purification and those who, they are with Our verses/evidences believing
Those who follow the messenger, the prophet the illiterate/belonging to a nation, whom they find him written at them in the Torah/Old Testament, and the New Testament/Bible , He orders them with the kindness/goodness , and forbids/prevents them from the obscenity , and He permits/allows for them the pure/allowed/permitted , and forbids/prohibits on them the bad/spoiled/wicked , and lays/raises from them their weight/crime/burden, and the leather or iron collars or handcuffs which was on them, so those who believed with him and supported/aided him , and gave him victory/aid and followed the light which was descended with him, those are the successful/winners
Say: "You, you the people, I am God`s messenger to you all/all together, which for him (is) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s ownership , no God except Him, He revives/makes alive , and He makes die, so believe by God, and His messenger the prophet the illiterate/belonging to a nation who believes by God, and His words/expressions, and follow him, maybe/perhaps you be guided
And from Moses` nation, a nation/generation guiding with the truth , and with it they are being just/equitable
And We separated/divided them (into) twelve (F) branches/Jewish tribes nations, and We inspired/transmitted to Moses, when his nation asked him for drink, that strike/move the stone with your stick/cane, so twelve (F) water springs/water wells flowed/gushed/spouted from it, every/each people had known their drinking place, and We shadowed/overshadowed on them the clouds, and We descended on them the manna/sap , and the quail/amusement, eat from goodnesses what We provided for you, and they did not cause injustice to Us/oppress Us, and but they were causing injustice/oppression (to) themselves
And if (it) was said to them: "Reside/inhabit this the village/urban city, and eat from it where/when you willed/wanted, and say humility/humbleness , and enter the door/entrance prostrating, We forgive for you your sins/mistakes , We will increase the good doers
So those who were unjust/oppressive exchanged/replaced/substituted a saying/opinion and belief other than which was said to them, so We sent on them filth/torture from the sky/space because (of) what they were causing injustice/oppression
And ask/question them about the village/urban city that was present (near) the sea/ocean , when they transgress/violate in the Saturday/Sabbath, when the fishes/large fishes/whales comes to them raised high/clearly showing (on the) day of their Sabbath/Saturday, and (the) day they do not observe the Sabbath by resting and worshipping (it) does not come to them, as/like that We test them because (of) what they were debauching
And when a nation from them said: "Why/for what (do) you preach/advise/warn a nation God (is) making them die/destroying them or torturing them, a strong (severe) torture." They said: "An apology/excuse to your Lord and maybe/perhaps they fear and obey
So when they forgot what they were reminded with it, We saved/rescued those who forbid/prevent from the bad/evil/harm, and We took those who were unjust/oppressive with strong/severe torture because (of) what they were debauching
So when they became arrogant/disobedient from what they were forbidden/prevented from it, We said to them: "Be/become despised/diminished apes/monkeys
And when your Lord announced/informed he will send (E) on them to the Resurrection Day who burdens/imposes upon them the torture`s evil/harm , that your Lord (is) quick/fast (E) (in) the punishment, and that He (is) forgiving (E), merciful
And We separated/divided them in the earth/Planet Earth (into) nations, from them the correct/righteous people, and from them other than that, and We tested them with the goodnesses and the sins/crimes, maybe/perhaps they return
So from after them succeeded/followed successions, they inherited The Book , they take/receive that enjoyable accessories/non-essentials/vanities the nearer , and they say: "(It) will be forgiven for us."108And if enjoyable accessories/non-essentials/vanities similar/equal to it comes to them they take/receive it, was not The Book`s promise/covenant being taken on (from) them, that they not say on God except the truth ? And they studied/memorized what is in it, and the home/house (of) the end (other life is) better/best , to those who fear and obey, so do you not reason/understand

And if they broke/violated their oaths from after their promise and they defamed/stabbed in yourreligion so fight/kill (the) leaders/examples (of) the disbelief, that they truly (have) no oaths/swearings for them, maybe/perhaps they terminate/stop
Do you not fight/kill a nation (that) broke/violated their oaths , and they got interested/began by forcing out the messenger, and they started/initiated (the) first time with you, do you fear them? So God (is) more worthy/deserving that you fear Him if you were believing

Did you make the pilgrimage`s drinking place/cup (water carrying) and tending to/visiting the Mosque the Forbidden/Sacred as who believed with God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and struggled/exerted in God`s way/sake ? They do not become equal/alike at God, and God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive
Those who believed and emigrated and struggled/exerted in God`s way/sake with their properties/wealths and themselves, (are) a step/degree greater at God, and those, they are the winners/successful

God had given you victory/aid in many homelands/battlefields and Hunain`s Day (the location of the famous battle between Arab tribes and Moslems), when your plentifulness pleased/marveled you, so (it) did not enrich/satisfy from you a thing, and the Earth/land narrowed/tightened on you with what (it) widened/broadened (its vastness/expanse), then you turned away giving (your) backs
Then God descended His tranquillity/calm on His messenger and on the believers, and He descended soldiers/warriors you did not see it, and He tortured those who disbelieved, and that (is) the disbeliever`s reward/reimbursement
Then God forgives from after that on whom He wills/wants, and God (is) forgiving, merciful
You, you those who believed but/truly the sharers/takers of partners (with God are) impurity/contamination , so they do not approach/near the Mosque the Forbidden/Sacred after this their year, and if you feared need/necessity/poverty, so God will/shall enrich/suffice you from His grace/favour , if He willed/wanted, that God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious
Fight/kill those who do not believe with God and nor the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and do not forbid/prohibit what God and His messenger forbid/prohibited, and do not take/adopt a religion the correct/right religion from those who were given/brought The Book , until they give/hand over the fee paid by non-Moslems living in a Moslem society (paid instead of Zakat by Moslems) from a hand, and (while) they are subservient/humiliated

They want that they extinguish/put out God`s light with their mouths, and God refuses/hates except that He completes His light, and even if the disbelievers hated (it)
He (is) who sent His messenger with the guidance, and the correct/truth religion, to make it apparent/visible on the religion(s) all of it, and even if the sharers/takers of partners (with God) hated (it)
You, you those who believed that many of the religious scholars , and the monks eat (E) the people`s properties/wealths by the falsehood, and prevent/obstruct from God`s way/path , and those who accumulate/herd the gold and the silver and do not spend it in God`s way/path , so announce good news to them with a painful torture

They had desired the treason/misguidance from before, and they turned/changed for you the matters/affairs until the truth came, and God`s order/command appeared and they are hating
And from them who says: "Permit/allow for me, and do not test/misguide me " Is it not in the treason/misguidance (that) they dropped/erred , and that Hell is surrounding (E) with the disbelievers
If goodness strikes you it harms them , and if disaster/every thing hated strikes you , they say: "We had taken our matter/affair from before." And they turn away and they are happy/delighted

God promised the hypocrites (M) and the hypocrites (F) and the disbelievers Hell`s fire immortally/eternally in it, it is enough for them, and God cursed/humiliated them and for them (is a) continuing torture
As/like those from before them they were stronger than you, (in) strength/power and (with) more properties/possessions , and children, so they lived long/enjoyed with their good luck/fortune, so you lived long/enjoyed with your good luck/fortune, as those from before you lived long/enjoyed with their good luck/fortune, and you plunged into/engaged in conversation as/like who plunged into/engaged in conversation , those their deeds (are) wasted in the present world, and the end (other life), and those, they are the losers

And from them who promised God: "If (E) He gave us from His grace/favour we will give charity (E) and we will be/become from the correct/righteous
So when He gave them from His grace/favour they were stingy/miser with it, and they turned away and (while) they are objecting/opposing

Say: "Hell`s fire (is) stronger heat, if they were understanding/learning
So they will laugh (E) little and they will weep (E) much, reimbursement because (of) what they were earning/gaining/acquiring
So if God returned you to a group of people from them, so they asked for permission from you to the getting out/exit (battle), so say: "You will never/not get out/emerge with me ever (E), and you will never/not fight/kill with me an enemy, that you accepted/became content with the sitting/remaining behind (the) first time , so sit/remain with the remaining behind
And do not ever pray on anyone from them (that) died, and do not stand on his grave/burial place, that they truly disbelieved by God and His messenger, and they died and (while) they are debauchers

And from the Arabs who takes what he spends (as) an obligated burden/monetary harm/loss , and he waits/remains with you the circles/disasters; on them (is) the bad/evil circle/disaster, and God (is) hearing/listening, knowledgeable
And from the Arabs who believes by God and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and takes what he spends (as) approachment to God (offerings) at God, and the messenger`s prayers, is it not an approachment to God (offering) for them?

Do not stand in it ever (E), a mosque/place of worshipping God (E) founded (established) on the fear and obedience (of God) from (the) first day (is) more worthy/deserving that you stand in it, in it (are) men they love/like that they purify themselves mentally and physically , and God loves/likes the pure/clean
Is who founded (established) his building/structure on fear and obedience from God and acceptance/approval better ? Or who founded (established) his building/structure on (the) edge/brink (of) a130cracking/falling/weakly undercut bank/shore , so it collapsed/fell down with him in Hell`s fire?

You, you those who believed, fear and obey God and be with the truthful
(It) was not to the city`s/town`s family/relation/people and who (is) around/surrounding them from the Arabs , that they delay (remain behind) from God`s messenger, and nor they wish/desire with themselves from his self/himself, that (is) because they (E) (experience) no thirst, and nor hardship/fatigue , and nor hunger strikes them in God`s sake , and they do not step on/set foot on a foothold (that) angers/enrages the131disbelievers, and they do not take/obtain (win) from an enemy receiving/obtaining (winning) except (that) it was written/decreed for them with it, correct/righteous deeds , that God does not loose/waste/destroy the good doer`s reward/wage

You, you those who believed, fright/kill those who follow/near you evilly from the disbelievers, and they should find in you strength/coarseness , and know that God (is) with the fearing and obeying
And when any chapter of the Koran was descended, so from them who says: "Which of you (has) this it increased him faith/belief?" So but those who believed, so it increased them faith/belief, and they be announced good news to/be cheerful
And but those who in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease, so it increased them obscenity/filth to their obscenity/filth , and they died and they are disbelieving
Do they not see/understand that they are being tested in every year once or twice , then they do not repent, and they do not mention/remember
And when any chapter of the Koran was descended, some of them looked to some, (and said): "Does from anyone see you?" Then they went away/diverted , God diverted their hearts/minds , because they are (E) a nation (that) do not understand/know
Now hath come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves: it grieves him that ye should perish: ardently anxious is he over you: to the Believers is he most kind and merciful
But if they turn away, Say: &quot;Allah sufficeth me: there is no god but He: On Him is my trust,- He the Lord of the Throne (of Glory) Supreme!&quot
A L R , those are the wise/judicious Book`s verses/evidences
Was it to the people astonishment/surprise that We inspired/transmitted to a man from them: "That warn/give notice (to) the people and announce good news (to) those who believed that for them (is) a foot (hold) (of) truth at their Lord." The disbelievers said: "That, that (is) an evident magician/sorcerer
That your Lord (is) God who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth in six days then He aimed to/tended to on the throne , He plans/regulates the matter/affair, (there is) no/none from a mediator except from after His permission/pardon, that one (is) God, your Lord, so worship Him, so do you not mention/remember/praise
To Him (is) your return all/all together, God`s promise truthfully , that He truly starts/initiates the creation, then He returns/repeats it to reward/reimburse those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds with the just/equitable, and those who disbelieved for them (is) a drink from hot/cold water and a painful torture because (of) what they were disbelieving
He is who made/put the sun light/shining and the moon a light, and He predestined/evaluated it places of descent/sequences/descents to know (the) number/numerous (of) the years and the counting/calculating, God did not create that except with the truth , He details/explains the verses/evidences to a nation knowing
That in difference (of) the night and the daytime and what God created in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth (are) signs/evidences (E) to a nation fearing and obeying
That those who do not hope/expect meeting Us, and they accepted/approved with the life the present/the worldly life, and they became assured/secured with it, and those who they are from Our verses/evidences ignoring/disregarding
Those, their shelter/refuge (is) the fire because (of) what they were acquiring/gathering
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, their Lord guides them because of their faith/belief (to) the rivers flowing/running from below/beneath them in the blessing/goodness (of) treed gardens/paradises
Their call/prayer in it (is): "Oh/you God Your praise/glory." And their greeting in it (is): "Security/peace." and their last call/prayer (is): "That the praise/gratitude (is) to God the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
And if God hurries/hastens the bad/evil/harm to the people (as) their hurrying/hastening with the good/wealth , their term/time would have been executed/accomplished to them, so We leave those who do not expect meeting Us in their tyranny/arrogance being confused/puzzled
And if the human (was) touched (by) the harm he called Us to his side or sitting or standing , so when We removed/uncovered from him his harm, he passed as if/though he did not call Us to harm (that) touched him,as/like that (it) was decorated/beautified to the spoilers/neglecters what they were making/doing
And We had destroyed the generations/peoples of eras from before you, when they caused injustice/oppression, and their messengers came to them with the evidences, and they were not to believe, as/like that We reward/reimburse the nation the criminals/sinners
Then We made/put you (as) caliphs/successors and replacers/leaders in the earth/Planet Earth from after them to see how you do
And if Our signs/verses evidences are read/recited on them, those who do not hope/expect meeting Us said: "Come/bring with a Koran other than that or exchange/replace it ." Say: "(It) is not to me that I exchange/replace it from my self/spontaneously/willingly that I follow except what is inspired/revealed to me, that I fear if I disobeyed my Lord (from) a great day`s torture
Say: " If God wanted/willed I would not (have) read/recited it on you, and He would not (have) informed you with (of) it, so I had stayed/remained in (between) you a life time from before it, so do you not reason/understand
So who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated on God lies/denials/falsifications or lied/falsified with His verses/evidences ? That He does not make the criminals/sinners succeed/win
And they worship from other than God what does not harm them and nor benefit them, and they say: "Those (are) our mediators at God." Say: "Do you inform God with what He does not know in the skies/space and nor in the earth/Planet Earth?" His praise/glory and high, mighty, exalted and dignified from what they share/make partners (with God)
And the people were not except one nation , so they differed/disagreed/disputed, and where it not for a word preceded from your Lord, (it) would have executed/ended (E) between them, in what they are in it differing/disagreeing
And they say: "If only an evidence/sign was descended on him from his Lord." So say: "But the absent/supernatural (is) to God so wait , that I am with you from the waiting
And if We made the people taste/experience mercy from after calamity/disastrous distress touched them, then for them (is) cheatery/deceit/schemes in Our verses/evidences . Say: "God (is) quicker/faster (in) cunning/scheming , that Our messengers write what you cheat/ deceive/scheme
He is who makes you walk/move/ride in the shore/land and the sea (large body of water) until when you were in the ships, and We flowed/ran with them with a good/enjoyable wind/breeze, and they became happy/rejoiced with it, (then) a stormy/violent wind came to it, and the waves/surges came to them from every place, and they thought/assumed that they are (being) surrounded/encircled with them, they called God faithful/loyal/devoted for Him (in) the religion: "If (E) you saved/rescued us from this, we will become (E) from the thankful/grateful
So when He saved/rescued them, then they oppress/transgress/corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth without the right , you, you the people but your oppression/transgression (is) on yourselves the life the present`s/worldly life`s long life/enjoyment, then to Us (is) your return, so We inform you with what you were making/doing
But the life the present`s/worldly life`s example (is) as/like water, We descended it from the sky, so the Earth`s/land`s plant mixed/mingled with it, from what the people eat and the camels/livestock, until the earth/land took its decoration/beauty and it became decorated/beautified, and its people thought/assumed that they are capable/overpowering on it, (then) Our order/matter came to/destroyed it at night or (at) daytime, so We made it uprooted as though it did not enrich/be inhabited by the yesterday/previous day, as/like that We detail/explain/clarify the verses/evidences to a nation thinking
And God, He calls to the safety`s/security`s/peace`s home/house, and He guides whom He wills/wants to a straight/direct way/road
To those who did good, the best/most beautiful/goodness and an increase (more), and no smoke/dust and nor humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses/oppresses their faces, those are the treed garden`s/paradise`s owners/company they are in it immortally/eternally
And (to) those who gathered/acquired the sins/crimes (a) reimbursement (of) a sin/crime with similar/equal to it and humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses/oppresses them, none from (a) protector/shelterer (is) for them from (other than) God, as though their faces (are) covered/darkened (with) parts/portions (of) the darkened night. Those are the fire`s owners/company , they are in it immortally/eternally
And a day We gather them all/all together , then We say to those who shared/made partners (with God): "Your place/position, you and your partners (with God)." So We separated/dispersed between them, and their partners (with God) said: "You were not us worshipping
So enough/sufficient with God (as) a witness/testifier between us and between you, if we were about your worshipping ignoring/neglecting (E)
At that place and time every self will find it is foolish what it advanced, and they were returned to God their owner/master the true , and what they were fabricating misguided/nullified from them
Say: "Who provides for you from the sky/space and the earth/Planet Earth? Or who owns/possesses the hearing/listening , and the eye sights/knowledge, and He brings out/emerges the live/alive from the dead, and He brings out/emerges the dead from the live/alive, and who plans/regulates the matter/affair?" So they will say: "God." so say: "So do you not fear and obey
So that one (is) God, your Lord the truth , so what after the truth (is there) except the misguidance, so how/where (do) you be sent away/diverted
As/like that your Lord`s word/expression became correct/true , on those who debauched , that they do not believe
Say: "Are there from your partners (with God) who starts/initiates the creation then he repeats it?" Say: "God starts/initiates the creation, then He repeats it. So how/where (do) you lie/turn away
Say: "Are there from your partners (with God) who guides to the truth ?" Say: "God guides to the truth .Is who guides to the truth more worthy/deserving that He be followed or who does not guide except that he be guided, so what (is it) for you how you judge/rule
And most of them do not follow except assumption/supposition , that the assumption/supposition does not suffice (replace) from the truth a thing, that God (is) knowledgeable with what they make/do
And this the Koran was/is not that it be fabricated from (by) other than God, and but confirmation (of) what (is) between his (Prophet Mohammad`s) hands, and detailing/explaining The Book , no doubt/suspicion in it, (it is) from the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
Or they say: "He fabricated it ." Say: "So come/bring with a chapter of the Koran similar/equal to it and call whom you were able from other than God, if you were truthful
But they lied/denied/falsified with what they did not comprehend with its knowledge, and its interpretation/explanation did not come to them, as/like those from before them lied/denied/falsified, so look/see how the unjusts`/oppressives` end/turn was
And from them who believed with it, and from them who does not believe with it, and your Lord (is) more knowledgeable with the corrupting
And if they lied/denied you , so say: "For me (is) my deed, and for you (is) your deed, you are innocent/renouncing from what I make/do , and I am innocent/renouncing from what you make/do
And from them who listen/hear to you, so do you make the deaf hear/listen and (even) if they were not reasoning/understanding
And from them who looks to you, so do you guide the blind/confused and (even) if they were not seeing/understanding
That God, does not cause injustice/oppression (to) the people a thing and but the people themselves cause injustice/oppression
And a day He gathers them as though they did not remain/wait except an hour from the daytime, getting to know each other, those who lied/denied with meeting God had lost, and they were not guided
And either We show you some/part (of) which/that We promise them, or We make you die, so to Us (is) their return, then God (is) witnessing on what they make/do
And to each/every nation/generation (is) a messenger, so if their messenger came, judgment was passed between them with the just/equitable, and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed
And they say: "When/at what time (is) that the promise if you were truthful
Say: "I do not own/possess to myself harm and nor benefit/usefulness except, what God willed/wanted, to every/each nation/generation (is) a term/time, if their term/time came, so they do not delay/lag behind an hour, and nor advance/precede
Say: "Did you see/understand if His torture came to you at night/suddenly at night/overnight or day time, what (do) the criminals/sinners hurry/rush/urge from Him
Is it then when (it) happened! (expression of wonderment) you believed with it/Him now, and you had been with it/Him hurrying/hastening
Then (it) was said to those who caused injustice/oppression: "Taste/experience the immortality`s/eternity`s torture,139are you being reimbursed except because (of) what you were gathering/acquiring
And they ask you to inform them: "Is it correct ?" Say: "Yes and (by) my Lord, that it truly is correct (E) , and you are not with disabling/frustrating
And if to every self (that) caused injustice/oppression what is in the earth/Planet Earth, it would have ransomed/compensated with it, and they kept the regret/sorrow/remorse secret when they saw/understood the torture, and was passed judgment/ordered between them with the just/equitable, and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed
Is not to God what is in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, is not God`s promise true , and but most of them do not know
He revives/makes alive and He makes die, and to Him you are being returned
You, you the people, a sermon/advice/warning had come to you from your Lord, and a cure/recovery to what (is) in the chests (innermosts), and guidance, and mercy to the believers
Say: "With God`s grace/favour and His mercy, so with that so they should be happy/rejoiced , He/it is better from what they gather/collect
Say: "Did you see/understand what God descended for you from provision so you made/created from it forbidden/prohibited and permitted/allowed?" Say: "Did God permit/allow for you, or on God you fabricate/cut and split
And what (is in the) thought/assumption (on) the Resurrection Day (of) those who fabricate on God the lie/falsehood ? That God (is owner) of (E) grace/favour/blessing on the people, and but most of them do not thank/be grateful
And you (do) not be in a matter/affair , and what you read/recite from it from Koran , and you do not make/do from deed(s) except (that) We were on you witnessing when you rush/hurry in it, and none from a weight (of) a smallest particle (smaller than an atom) in the earth/Planet Earth and nor in the sky/ space, and nor smaller/littler than that, and nor greater/magnified is far, hidden and distant from your Lord, except (it is) in an evident/clear Book
Is it not that God`s patrons/followers (that there is) no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving
Those who believed and were fearing and obeying
For them the good news in the life the present/the worldly life and in the end (other life), (there is) no exchange/replacement/substitution to God`s words/expressions, that it is the winning/triumph , the great
And (let) not their saying/word/opinion and belief to sadden you , that the glory/might (is) to God all/wholly , He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable
Is it not that to God who (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth? And those who call from other than God partners, (they) do not follow (anything) except the assumption/supposition, and that they (are) except lying/speculating
He is who made/created for you the night to be tranquil/quiet in it, and the daytime to see , that in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation hearing/listening
They said: "God took/received a child (son)." His praise/glory He is the rich, for Him what is in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, at you (is) no proof/evidence with that, are you saying on God what you do not know
Say: "That those who fabricate/cut and split on God the lies/falsehood do not succeed/win
Long life/enjoyment in the present world then to Us (is) their return, then We make them taste/experience the torture the strong (severe) because (of) what they were disbelieving
And read/recite on them Noah`s information/news, when he said to his nation: "You (my) nation, if my place/position and my reminding/mentioning with Gods` evidences/verses had become a burden on you, so on God I relied/depended , so gather/collect/unify your matter/affair and your partners (with God), then your matter/affair be not on you ambiguous/vague (covert) , then pass judgment/order to me, and do not give me time/delay me
So if you turned away, so I did not ask/demand (of) you from a reward/wage that my reward/wage (is) except on God, and I was ordered/commanded, that I be from the Moslems/submitters
So they denied him , so We saved/rescued him and who (was) with him in the ship , and We made/put them (as) caliphs/successors and replacers/leaders, and We drowned/sunk those who lied/denied/falsified with Our evidences/verses , so look/see how was the end/turn (result of) the warned/given notice
Then We sent from after him messengers to their nations, so they came to them with the evidences/verses , so they were not to believe with what they lied/denied/falsified with it from before, as/like that We stamp/cover/seal on the transgressors`/violators`/breakers` hearts/minds
Then (E) We sent from after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his nobles/groups/assembly with Our verses/evidences , so they became arrogant and they were a nation (of) criminals/sinners
So when the truth came to them from at Us, they said: "That truly (is) evident magic/sorcery (E)
Moses Said: "Do you say to the truth when it came to you, is that magic/sorcery?" and the magicians/sorcerers do not succeed/win
They said: "Did you come to us to turn us away (divert us) from what we found our fathers on it, and the arrogance/greatness be to you (B) in the earth/Planet Earth, and we are not to you (B) with believing
And Pharaoh said: "Bring to me with every knowledgeable magician/sorcerer
So when the magicians/sorcerers came, Moses Said: "Throw/throw away what you are throwing/throwing away
So when they threw/threw away Moses said: "What the magic/sorcery you came with it, that truly God will waste/annul/cancel it, that truly God does not correct/repair (the) deeds (of) the corrupting
And God corrects the truth with His words/expressions, and even if the criminals/sinners hated (it)
So did not believe in Moses except descendants from his nation on fear from Pharaoh and their nobles/groups/assembly that he (Pharaoh) tortures them , and that Pharaoh (is) high and mighty (E) in the earth/planet Earth, and that he (is) from (E) the spoilers/exceeders of the limit
And Moses said: "You (my) nation if you had believed by God, so on Him rely/depend if you were Moslems/submitters
So they said: "On God we relied/depended . Our Lord do not make/put us (as a) test to the nation the unjust/oppressors
And save/rescue us with Your mercy from the nation the disbelievers
And We inspired/transmitted to Moses and his brother that you (B) reside/establish houses/homes to your (B)`s nation by a city/border/region/Egypt, and make your houses/homes direction, and keep up the prayers, and announce good news (to) the believers
And Moses said: "Our Lord, that You, You gave/brought Pharaoh and his nobles/assembly decoration/beauty/ornament and properties/possessions/wealth in the present world/worldly life, our Lord, to misguide (E) from Your way/path , our Lord wipe out/destroy on their properties/possessions/wealths and stamp/hit on their hearts/minds so they do not believe until they see the torture the painful
He said: "Your (B)`s call/request/prayer had been answered/replied to, so be straight/direct, and do not follow (the) way/path (of) those who do not know
And We crossed/passed/passed through with Israel`s sons and daughters the sea , so Pharaoh and his soldiers/warriors followed them (with) transgression and violating/breaking until when the drowning/sinking caught up/overtook him , he said: "I believed that He is, no God except who Israel`s descendants believed with Him, and I am from the Moslems/submitters
Now, and you had disobeyed before, and you were from the corrupting
So the day/today We save/rescue you with your body/top set (of) armor to be to who (is) behind you an evidence/sign , and that many from the people (are) from Our evidences/verses/signs ignoring/disregarding (E)
And We had resided/settled to Israel`s sons and daughters truthful residence/settlement , and We provided for them from the goodnesses , so they did not differ/disagree/dispute until the knowledge came to them, that your Lord passes judgment (settles) between them (in) the Resurrection Day in what they were in it differing/disagreeing/disputing
So if you were in doubt/suspicion from what We descended to you, so ask/question those who read The Book from before you, the truth had come to you from your Lord, so do not be from the doubting/arguing
And do not be from those who lied/denied/falsified with God`s verses/evidences/signs, so you be from the losers
That those who God`s word/expression (was) deserved on them do not believe
And even if every/each verse/evidence/sign came to them, until they see/understand the torture the painful
So where it not for a village/urban city (that) believed, so its faith/belief benefited it, except Jonah`s/Yonis` nation, when they believed We removed/uncovered (relieved) from them the shameful/scandalous/disgraceful torture in the present world/worldly life, and We gave them long life/made they enjoy to a time
And if your Lord wanted/willed who is in the earth/Planet Earth all of them, all/all together would have believed (E), so do you compel/force the people until they be believers/believing
And (it) was not to a self that she/it believes except with God`s permission, and He makes/puts the142obscenity/filth on those who do not reason/understand/comprehend
Say: "Look/see , what is in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and the evidences/verses , and the warning/notices do not satisfy/suffice from a nation (that) do not believe
So do they wait/watch (for) except as/like days/times (of) those who past/expired from before them, Say: "So wait/watch , that I am with you from the waiting/watching
Then We save/rescue Our messengers and those who believed, as/like that truthfully on Us We save/rescue the believers
Say: "You, you the people, if you were in doubt/suspicion of/from my religion, so I do not worship those whom you worship from other than God, and but I worship God who makes you die, and I was ordered/commanded that I be from the believers
And that stand/keep up your face/front/direction to the religion (as) a submitter/Unifier of God , and do not be from the sharers/takers of partners (with God)
And do not call from other than God what does not benefit you and does not harm you, so if you made/did , so that you are then from the unjust/oppressors
And if God touches you with harm, so (there is) no remover/uncoverer (reliever) to it except Him, and if He wants/wills/intends you with goodness/generosity , so (there is) no returner for His grace/favour/blessing, He strikes/hits with it whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves, and He is the forgiving, the merciful
Say: "You, you the people, the truth had come to you from your Lord, so who was guided, so but he guides for his self, and who misguided , so but he misguides on it, and I am not on you with a guardian/protector
And follow what is inspired/transmitted to you, and be patient until God judges/rules , and He is best (of) the judges/rulers
A L R , a Book its verses/evidences were perfected/tightened , then were detailed/explained/clarified from at/by (a) wise/judicious, expert/experienced
That you not worship except God, that I am (E) to you from Him (a) warner/giver of notice, announcer of good news
And that ask for forgiveness (from) your Lord then repent to Him, He gives you long life/makes you enjoy good/beautiful long life/enjoyment to a named/identified (specified) term/time, and He gives/brings each (owner) of grace/favour/blessing His grace/favour/blessing, and if they turned away, so that I, I fear on you a big/great day`s torture
To God (is) your return, and He is on every thing capable/able
Is it not that they truly fold/bend/double/twist (hide) their chests (innermosts) to hide from Him? Is it not that when they cover/darken themselves (with) their clothes/garments/dresses, He knows what they keep secret and what they declare/publicize/announce? That He is knowledgeable of the chests (innermosts)
And (there is) none from a walker/creeper/crawler in the earth/Planet Earth except (that) on God (is) its provision, and He knows its settlement/establishment/affixation, and its depository/storage place , all (is) in (a) clear/explained Book
And He is who created the skies/space and the earth, in six days/times, and His throne was/is on the water, to test you which of you (is) best/better (in) deed(s), and if (E) you said: "That you are being resurrected/revived from after the death/lifelessness." Those who disbelieved will say (E): "That, this (is) except clear/evident magic/sorcery
And if We delayed the punishment from them to a counted/numbered generation they will say (E) what prevents/withholds it ? Is it not (on that) day (when it) comes to them (it is) not diverted/sent away from them? And surrounded/encircled with them what they were with it mocking/making fun of
And if (E) We made the human/mankind taste/experience from Us mercy, then We removed it from him, that he truly is (a) despairing/hopeless (E) (insistent) disbeliever/(insisting) disbelief
And if (E) We made him taste/experience blessing/goodness after calamity/disastrous distress touched him, he will say (E): "The sins/crimes went away (were) eliminated/(were) wiped out from me." That he is happy/rejoiced/delighted proud/arrogant
Except those who were patient, and made/did the correct/righteous deeds , those for them (is) a forgiveness and (a) big/great wage/reward
So maybe/perhaps you are leaving some/part (of) what is inspired/transmitted to you, and narrowing/tightening with it your chest (innermost), that they say: "If only a treasure was descended on him, or (an) angel came with him." But you are (a) warner/giver of notice, and God (is) on every thing (a) guardian/protector
Or they say: "He fabricated/cut and split it." Say: "So come or bring with ten chapters of the Koran similar/equal/alike to it fabricated , and call whom you were able from other than God if you were truthful
So if they do not answer/reply to you, so know that (the Koran) was/is descended with God`s knowledge , that (there is) no God except Him, so are you submitters/surrenderers/Moslems
Who was/is wanting the life the present/worldly life and its decoration/beauty/ornament, We fulfill/complete to them their deeds in it, and they in it are not being reduced/cheated/caused injustice to
Those are those not (nothing is) for them in the end (other life) except the fire , and what they made/did (was) wasted/invalidated in it, and is being wasted/annulled/canceled what they were making/doing
Is who was on an evidence from his Lord, and he reads/recites/follows it a witness/testifier from Him, and from before him/it Moses` Book a leader/clear road/an example and a mercy? Those believe with it, and who disbelieves from the groups/parties with Him/it, so the fire (is) his appointment/promise, so do not be in doubt from it, that it is the truth from your Lord, and but most of the people do not believe
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who fabricated/cut and split on God lies/denials/falsifications? Those, they are being displayed/exhibited/shown on (to) their Lord, and the witnesses/testifiers (the angels) say: "Those (are) those who lied/denied/falsified on their Lord." Is not God`s curse/torture on the unjust/oppressors
Those who object/prevent/obstruct from God`s way/path/sake , and they ask/wish/desire it (be) bent/crookedness/indirectness, and they, with the end (other life) they are disbelievers
Those, were not (to) be disabling/frustrating in the earth/Planet Earth and (there) were not for them from other than God from guardians/allies , the torture (will) be doubled/multiplied for them, and they were not able (of) the hearing (to hear)/listening (to listen) , and they were not seeing/looking/understanding
Those are those who lost themselves, and what they were fabricating/cutting and splitting (was) wasted/lost from them
Undoutably/certainly that they (are) in the end (other life), they are the most losers
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and they became humble/tranquil to their Lord, those are the Paradise`s owners/company/friends, they are in it immortally/eternally
The two groups`/parti es` example/proverb (is as) the blind, and the deaf, and the seeing , and the hearing , do they become (an) equal/alike example/proverb? So do you not mention/remember
And We had sent Noah to his nation: "That I am for you (an) evident/clear warner/giver of notice
That do not worship except God, that I, I fear on you a painful day`s torture
So the nobles/groups/assembly those who disbelieved from his nation said: "We do not see you except (as) a human similar/equal/alike to us, and we do not see you (that) followed you except those who are our lowest/most despised, the opinion/belief (is) apparent, and we do not see for you on us from grace/favour/blessing, but we suspect you (are) liars/deniers/falsifiers
He said: "You (my) nation, did you see/understand if I was on an evidence from my Lord, and He gave me mercy from at Him, so (it) was blinding/confusing on you, that do we oblige/compel it to you , and you are to it hating
And you my nation, I do not ask/demand/beg you on it (for) property/possession/wealth, that my reward/wage is except on (from) God, and I am not with expelling/driving out those who believed, that they are receiving/meeting/finding their Lord, and but I only, I see/understand you (as) a nation being lowly/ignorant
And you (my) nation, who gives me victory/aid from God, if I expelled/forced them out, so do you not mention/remember
And I do not say to you: `At me (are) God`s safes/storages (treasures), and I do not know the unseen/absent .`And I do not say: `That I am (an) angel .` And I do not say to those who your eyes/sights despise/belittle : `God will never/not give/bring them goodness .` God (is) more knowledgeable with what (is) in their selves, that I am then from (E) the unjust/oppressors
They said: "You Noah, you had argued/disputed with us, so you increased arguing/disputing with us, so bring to us with what you promise us, if you were from the truthful
He said: "But God brings with it to you, if He willed/wanted and you are not with disabling/frustrating
And my advise does not benefit you, if I wanted/intended that I advise for you, if God was wanting/willing that He misguides/lures you, He is your Lord, and to Him you are being returned
Or they say: "He fabricated/cut and split it." Say: "If I fabricated/cut and split it so on me (is) my criminality/committing (of) sins, and I am innocent/renouncing from what you commit a crime/sin
And (it) was inspired/transmitted to Noah, that (none) will never/not believe from your nation except who had believed, so do not be miserable/fallen in hardship because (of) what they were making/doing
And make/produce the ship/ships with Our eyes/sights, and Our inspiration/transmission , and do not address/converse with Me in those who caused injustice/oppression, that they are being drowned/sunken
And he makes/produces the ship/ships, and whenever a group/assembly/nobles from his nation passed on (by) him, they humiliated/mocked from him, he said: "If you humiliate/mock from us, so (that) we are humiliating/mocking from you as you humiliate/mock
So you will/shall know whom torture comes (to) him (that) shames/scandalizes him , and continuing torture (be) placed on him/deserved (to) him
Until when Our order/command came, and the hollow clay oven/furnace boiled over/gushed, We said: Carry/load/lift in it from every/each a pair/couple two, and your family/people/relation, except who the saying/words preceded on him, and who believed." And none believed with him except a little/few
And he said: "Ride/embark/board in it, by God`s name its channel/passage/course , and its anchor/landing , that my Lord (is) forgiving, merciful
And it flows/orbits with them in waves/surges as the mountains and Noah called/cried (to) his son, and (while his son) he was in a separation/isolation : "You my son, ride/embark/board with us, and do not be with the disbelievers
He said: "I will take shelter/refuge to a mountain (that) protects/shelters me from the water." He said: "(There is) no protector/shelterer today, from God`s order/command except who He had mercy upon." And148the waves/surges came in between/intervened between them (B), so he was from drowned/sunken
And (it) was said: "You earth/Planet Earth/land swallow your water, and you sky/space cease/stop/clear up ."And the water reduced/receded , and the matter/affair/order/command was accomplished/carried out, and it straightened/leveled on the Joody , and was said: "Curse to the nation the unjust/oppressive
And Noah called/cried (to) his Lord so he said: "My Lord, that my son (is) from my family , and that your promise (is) the truth , and you are most judicious (of) the judges/rulers
He said: "You Noah, that he is not from your family/relation/people. That he is (a) not correct/righteous deed, so do not question/ask Me, what is not with knowledge to you with it (you have no knowledge of), that I advise you that you be from the lowly/ignorant
He said: "My Lord that I seek protection with You, that I ask/beg You what is not with me knowledge with it (I know nothing about), and unless You forgive for me and have mercy upon me, I will be from the losers
(It) was said: "You Noah, descend/enter with safety/security/peace from Us and blessings on you, and on nations from what/who (are) with you, and nations We will give them long life/make them enjoy, then painful torture from Us touches them
Those are from the unseen information/news, We inspire/transmit it to you, you were not knowing it, you, and nor your nation from before, that, so be patient that the end (result is) to the fearing and obeying
And to Aad, their brother Hoodan/Hood, he said: "You (my) nation, worship God (there is) not for you from a God other than Him, that you are except fabricators/cutters and splitters
You (my) nation, I do not ask/beg you on it (from) a reward/wage/fee, that my reward/wage/fee (is) except on who created me , so do you not reason/understand
And you (my) nation, ask for forgiveness (from) your Lord then repent to Him, He sends the skies/space on you flowing/pouring abundantly, and He increases you strength/power to your strength/power , and do not turn away (as) criminals/sinners
They said: "You Hood, you did not come to us with an evidence, and we are not with leaving our Gods from/on your saying/opinion and belief and We are not to you with believing
That we say: `Except some of our Gods afflicted you with bad/evil/harm.` He said: "I make God a witness/testifier, and witness/testify, that I am innocent/renouncing from what you share/make partners (with God)
From other than Him, so plot/conspire against me all/all together, then you will not give me time/delay me
That I relied/depended on God, my Lord and your Lord, (there is) not from a walker/creeper except He is taking with its forehead/foreheads` hair, that my Lord (is) on (a) straight/direct/balanced road/way
So if they turned away, so I had communicated/informed you what I was sent with it to you, and my Lord makes a successor a nation other than you, and you do not harm Him a thing, that my Lord (is) on every thing (an) honest protector/observer
And when Our order/command came, We saved/rescued Hoodan/Hood and those who believed with him, with mercy from Us, and We saved/rescued them from a strong torture
And that is Aad, they disbelieved and denied with their Lord`s evidences/verses and they disobeyed His messengers, and they followed every stubborn`s/obstinant`s tyrant`s/rebels` order/command
And they were followed in this the present world (by) curse/torture and the Resurrection Day, is not that Aad disbelieved (in) their Lord, is not destruction/death/curse to Aad, Hood`s nation
And to Thamud their brother Saleh, He said: "You (my) nation worship God, (there is) not for you from a God other than Him, He created you in the Earth , and He made you inhabit/populate in it, so ask Him for forgiveness, then repent to Him, that my Lord (is) near/close answering/replying
They Said: "You Saleh, you had been between us promising/hoped for before this, do you forbid/prevent us that we worship what our fathers worship? And that we truly (are) in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from what you call us to it
He said: "You (my) nation did you see/understand if I was on an evidence from my Lord, and He gave me from Him mercy, so who gives me victory/aid if I disobeyed Him, so you do not increase me except loss
And you (my) nation this (is) God`s female camel for you (as) an evidence/sign . So leave it eat in God`s earth/ground/land and do not touch it with bad/evil/harm, so (then) near/close torture takes/punishes you
So they wounded it/slaughtered it/cut it/made it infertile, so he said: "Enjoy three days in your home/country , that (is) a promise not denied/falsified
So when Our promise came We saved/rescued Saleh and those who believed with him, with mercy from Us and from that days` shame/scandal/disgrace, that your Lord, He is the powerful/strong, the glorious/mighty
And the loud strong cry/torture/raid took/punished those who caused injustice/oppression, so they became/became in the morning in their homes/countries stuck to the ground (dead)

And Our messengers had come (to) Abraham with the good news. They said: "Greeting/security/peace ." He said: "Greeting/security/peace ." So he did not stay/wait/remain (before) that (E) he came with a toasted/well done (m) calf
So when he saw/understood their hands do not reach to it, he denied/did not recognize them , and he felt inner horror/fright fearfully/frightfully from them, they said: "Do not fear, that we, we were sent to Lot`s nation
And His woman (wife) standing , so she laughed/wondered, so We announced good news to her with Issac, and from behind Issac, Jacob
She said: "Oh my calamity/scandal/misfortune , do I give birth and I am old/weak and that (is) my husband old aged , that, that (is) an unusual/strange thing (E)
They said: "Are you wondering/astonished from God`s order/command/matter/affair, God`s mercy and His blessings on you people of the house/home, that He is praiseworthy/commendable, glorious/magnified
So when the fear/fright went away from Abraham, and the good news came to him, (he) argues/disputes with Us in150Lot`s nation
That Abraham (was) clement/patient (E) groaner/moaner returning to God/repenting
You Abraham, turn away from that, that it truly, your Lord`s order/command had come, and that they, (a) torture (which is) not being returned, is coming to them
And when Our messengers came (to) Lot, he felt bad/evil/harm because of them and he was impatient with them (became uptight) , and he said: "This (is a) very hot (difficult) day
And his nation came to him rushing disturbedly/hysterically/madly to him, and from before they were making/doing the sins/crimes, he said: "You (my) nation those are my daughters, they are (F) purer for you, so fear and obey God and do not shame/scandalize/disgrace me in (front of) my guests, is (there) not from you a correctly/rightly guided man

So when Our order/command came, We made its high/elevated, its lowest/bottom (up side down) and We rained on it stones of dry and hardened mud neatly piled over each other
Marked/identified at your Lord and it is not with far/distant from the unjust/oppressors
And to Madyan/Madya (We sent) their brother Shu`aib, he said: "You (my) nation, worship God (there is) not for you from a God other than Him, and do not reduce/decrease the measuring/weighing device , and the scale/weight , that I see/understand you with goodness , and that I, I fear on you a surrounding`s/encircling`s day`s torture
And you (my) nation fulfill/complete the measuring/weighing device and the scale/weight with the just/equitable, and do not reduce/cheat the people (of) their things, and do not corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth disordering/corrupting
God`s remainder/remnant/rest (is) best for you if you were believing, and I am not with a protector/observer on you

He said: "You (my) nation, did you see/understand if I were on an evidence from my Lord, and He provided for me from Him a good/beautiful provision , and I do not want that I differ/disagree with you to what I forbid/prevented you from it, that truly I want (nothing) except the correction/repair/reconciliation what I was able (to do), and my success/inspiration is except by God, on Him I relied/depended , and to Him I151repent/obey
And you (my) nation (let) not my defiance/animosity (to you) make you commit a crime/sin that strikes you (with) similar (to) what stuck Noah`s nation, or Hood`s nation, or Saleh`s nation, and Lot`s nation is not with far/distant from you
And ask for forgiveness from your Lord, then repent to Him, that my Lord (is) merciful, loving/affectionate
They said: "You Shu`aib, we do not understand/know much (from) what you say, and that we, we see/understand you (E) (are) in us weak, and where it not for your tribe/group, we would have stoned you, and you are not with a dear on us

And when Our order/command came, We saved/rescued Shu`aib and those who believed with him with mercy from Us, and the loud strong cry/torture raid took/punished those who caused injustice/oppression, so they became/became in the morning in their homes/countries struck to the ground (dead)
As though they did no inhabit/enrich in it, is not (a) destruction/death/curse to Madyan, as Thamud was destroyed/dead/cursed
And We had sent Moses with Our evidences/signs and (an) evident proof/evidence
To Pharaoh and his nobles/group/assembly, so they followed Pharaoh`s order/command, and Pharaoh`s order/command is not with (the) correct/right guidance
He precedes/goes before his nation (on) the Resurrection Day, so He made them approach/near the fire ,and how bad (is) the army/thirst , the targeted/neared
And they were followed in this (by) curse/torture and (on) the Resurrection Day, how bad (is) the giving/support , the given/(desired) support
That (is) from the villages`/urban cities` information/news, We narrate/relay it on (to) you, from it (there are villages) standing and harvested/uprooted
And We did not cause injustice/oppression to them, and but they caused injustice/oppression (to) themselves, so their gods which they call from other than God did not enrich/satisfy from a thing from them (their gods did not help them in any way or thing), when your Lord`s order/command came, and they did not increase them other than destruction/loss
And as/like that (is) your Lord`s punishing , if/when He took/punished the villages/urban cities, and (while) it is unjust/oppressive , that His punishing (is) strong (severe)
That in this (is) a sign/evidence (E) to who feared the end`s/other life`s torture, that (is) a day/time the people (are) being gathered/collected to Him/it, and that (is) a witnessed day
And We do not delay it, except a term/time counted/prepared
(When that) day comes, a self does not speak/talk except with His permission, so from them (are people) miserable/unhappy and happy/fortunate
So but those who were miserable/unhappy, so (they are) in the fire , for them in it (is) deep exhalation and loud inhalation
Immortally/eternally in it as long as the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth continued/lasted, except what your Lord willed/wanted, that your Lord (is a) maker/doer, to what He wills/wants

And We had given/brought Moses The Book , so it was differed/disputed in it, and were it not for a word/expression (that) preceded from your Lord, (it) would have ended/accomplished (settled) (E) between them, and that they are in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from it
And that your Lord then, will fulfill/complete for them (E) each/every (one`s) deeds, that He (is) with what they make/do an expert/experienced
So be straight/direct as you were ordered/commanded, and who repented with you, and do not tyrannize/exceed the limit, that He (is) with what you make/do seeing
And do not lean towards to those who caused injustice/oppression, so the fire touches you, and (there are) no guardians/allies for you from other than God, then you (will) not be given victory/aid
And keep up the prayers to (the) ends/edges (of) the daytime (to) parts from the night from the night; that the goodnesses wipe off/eliminate the sins/crimes, that (is) a remembrance/reminder to the praising/glorifying
And be patient, so then God does not waste/loose/destroy the good doers` reward/wage
So where it not for (owners) of a remainder/remnant , from the generations/centuries from before you, (who were) forbidding/preventing from the corruption in the earth/Planet Earth, except a few from whom We saved/rescued from them; and those who caused injustice/oppression followed what they were luxuriated ungrateful and arrogant in it, and they were criminals/sinners
And your Lord was not to destroy the villages/urban cities with injustice/oppression and its people (are) correcting/repairing
And if your Lord willed/wanted He would have made the people one nation, and they still/continue differing/disagreeing
Except who your Lord had mercy upon and for that He created them, and your Lord`s word/expression (is) completed: "I will fill (E) Hell from the Jinns and the people all together
And all (every thing) We narrate/inform on (to) you from the messengers` information/news, what We strengthen with it your heart , and in this came to you the truth and a sermon/advise/warning, and a153remembrance/reminder to the believers

And wait/expect/watch, We are waiting/expecting/watching
And to God (is) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s unseen/surpernatural , and to Him the matter/affair all of it is returned, so worship Him, and rely/depend on Him, and your Lord is not with ignoring/neglecting/disregarding from what you make/do

You, my son, do not relay/inform your dream on (to) your brothers, so they conspire/plot to you a plot/conspiracy , that the devil (is) to the human/mankind a clean/evident enemy
And as/like that your Lord chooses/purifies you and teaches/informs you from the information`s/speech`s interpretation/explanation, and He completes His blessing on you, and on Jacob`s family, as/like He completed it on your fathers (forefathers) before, Abraham, and Isaac, that your Lord (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious
In Joseph and his brothers (there) had been signs/evidences to the askers/questioners
When they said: "Joseph (E), and his brother, (are) more lovable/likable to our father than us, and we (are) a group/band/company, that truly our father (is) in (E) clear/evident misguidance
Kill/fight Joseph or throw him/cast him away (to) a land , your father`s face becomes free/alone for you, and you be from after it a correct/righteous nation
A speaker from them said: "Do not kill/fight Joseph, and (but) throw him/throw him away in the well`s/deep well`s low hidden area/grave, some (of) the caravan unintentionally finds and picks him up, if you were making/doing
They said: "You, our father, why for you (that) you do not trust/entrust us on Joseph, and that we (are) to him faithful/sincere (E)

And said who bought him from (the) city/border/region/Egypt to/for his woman (wife): "Be generous/kind (in) his home/residence , perhaps he benefits us, or we take him (as) a child (son)." And like that, We highly positioned/secured to Joseph in the earth/Planet Earth, and to teach/instruct him from interpreting/explaining the information/speeches , and God (is) defeater/conqueror on His order/command/matter/affair, and but most (of) the people do not know

He said: "My Lord, the prison/jail (is) more likable to me from what they call me to it, and unless you divert from me their conspiring I incline to (give up) to them (F), and I be from the lowly/ignorant
So his Lord answered/replied to him, so He diverted from him their (F) conspiring , that He truly is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable
Then it appeared to them from after what they saw/understood the evidences/signs they imprison him (E) until a time
And two youths/adolescents entered with him the prison/jail, one of them (B) said: "That I , I see myself, I press/squeeze an intoxicant ."

He said: "What (is) your matter/affair/concern when you (P/F) seduced/enticed Joseph from himself." They said: "Remoteness to God , we did not know from (of) bad/evil/harm on him."

And the ends` (other life`s) reward (E) (is) better to those who believed and were fearing and obeying
And Joseph`s brothers/brethren came, so they entered on him, so he knew them, and they are to him ignorant (not recognizing)
And when he outfitted them with their preparation/equipment (goods) , he said: "Come to me with a brother to you from your father, do you not see/understand, that I, I fulfill/complete the measuring/weighing device, and I am best of the senders of the descenders (hosts)
So if you did not come to me with him so (there is) no measurement/weight for you at me, and do not approach/near me
They said: "We will entice/solicit from him his father, and we are making/doing (E)
And he said to his youths/servants : "Put their goods/merchandise in their packsaddles, maybe/perhaps they know (recognize) it when they returned to their family/people , maybe/perhaps they return
So when they returned to their father, they said: "You our father, the measuring/weighing device (the goods) was prevented/prohibited from (for) us, so send with us our brother, we take (goods) by measure/weight, we are for him protectors/guards (E)
He said: "Do I, I entrust you on him, except as I entrusted you on his brother from before? So God (is the) best protector , and he (is) most merciful (of) the merciful

And he said: "You my sons, do not enter from one door/entrance, and enter from separate doors/entrances, and I do not suffice/enrich from you from God from a thing, that the judgment/rule (is) except to God, on Him (E) I relied/depended , and on Him so should rely/depend the reliant/dependent
And when they entered from where their father ordered/commanded them, and (it) was not to suffice/enrich from them from God from a thing, except a need/necessity in Jacob`s self he accomplished it, and that truly he is (an owner) of knowledge to what We taught/instructed him , and but most of the people do not know
And when they entered on Joseph, he gave shelter/refuge (hosted) his brother to him, he said: "That I, I am your brother, so do not be miserable because (of) what they were making/doing

So he began with their bags/containers , before his brother`s bag/container , then he brought it out from his brother`s bag/container, as/like that, We plotted/conspired to Joseph, he was not to take his brother in the king`s religion/domain , except that God wills/wants, We raise whom We will/want stages/degrees , and above each (owner) of knowledge (is more) knowledgeable
They said: "If he steals/robs, so a brother to him had stolen/robbed from before." So Joseph kept it secret in himself, and did not show it to them, he said: "You are a worse position , and God (is) more knowledgeable with what you describe/categorize
They said: "You, you Elaziz/Egyptian ruler, that to him (is) an old aged big father, so take/receive any of us (in) his place/position, that we, we see you from the good doers
He said: "I seek protection (of) God, that we take except whom we found our belongings/effects/goods at him then we are unjust/oppressive (E)
So when they despaired from him, they cleared secretly conversing, their oldest said: "Did you not know that your father, had taken on you a promise/covenant from God and from before what you abused/exceeded the limit in (on) Joseph, so I will never/not leave/depart the land until my father permits/allows for me, or God judges/rules for me, and he (is) best (of) the judges/rulers
Return to your father so say: `You, our father, that your son stole/robbed, and we did not witness/testify except with what we knew, and we were not to the unseen observing/guarding
And ask/question the village/urban city which we were in it, and the caravan which we came in it, and we are, truthful (E)
He (their father) said: "But your selves enticed/tolerated for you an order/command/matter/affair, so graceful patience, perhaps God that (He) brings them to me all together, that He (is) the knowledgeable, the wise/judicious
And he turned away from them, and he said: "Oh my sorrow, on Joseph," and his two eyes whitened, from the sadness/grief, and he is suppressed
They said: "By God you still remember/mention Joseph until you be sick and weak/diminished or you be from the perishing/dying
He said: "But I complain my grief/condition and my sadness/grief to God and I know from God what you do not know

To disbelieve with what We gave/brought them, so live long/enjoy, so you will/shall know

He hides/conceals from the nation from (the) bad/evil/harm (of) what he was announced good news to with it, does he hold/grasp/cling to it on disgrace/weakness , or he buries/hides/conceals it in the dust/earth? Is (it) not bad/evil what they judge/rule
To those who do not believe with the end (other life) the bads`/evil`s example/proverb, and to God the example/proverb the highest/mightiest , and He is the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious
And if God punishes the people because of their injustice/oppression, He would not (have) left on it from a walker/creeper/crawler , and but He delays them to a named/identified term/time, so if their term/time came, they do not delay/lag behind an hour, and they do not advance/precede (an hour)
And they make/create/put to God what they hate, and their tongues/speeches describes/categorizes the lies/falsehood , that to them (is) the best/most beautiful , undoutably/certainly that to them (is) the fire , and that they truly are neglected/wasted/hastened

And fulfill/complete with God`s promise/contract if you promised/pledged , and do not break/destroy the faith/belief after its confirmation/assurance , and you had made/put God on you (as) a sponsor/supporter , that God knows what you make/do
And do no be like who unbound/broke/destroyed her yarn/spun thread (into) unraveling/fraying/untwisted strands of yarn from after (its) strength , you take your rights/oaths (as) deceit/blemishes between you, that (E) a nation be more grown/increased than a nation, but/truly God tests you with it, and to clarify/show/explain for you (on) the Resurrection Day what you were in it differing/disagreeing/disputing
And if God wanted/willed He would have made/created you one nation/generation , and but God misguides whom He wills/wants, and He guides whom He wills/wants, and you will be asked/questioned (E) about what you were making/doing
And do not take your rights/oaths (as) deceit/blemishes between you, so (a) foot/foothold in goodness and knowledge slips/falls/sins after its steadfastness/stability/strength , and you taste/experience the bad/evil/harm because (of) what you prevented/obstructed from God`s way/path , and for you (is) a great torture

That He, (there) is not for him power/control on those who believed and on their Lord they rely/trust/surrender to
But his power/control (is) on those who follow him, and those whom (are) with him, (they are) sharing/taking partners (as gods)
And if We exchanged/replaced/substituted a verse in place (of) a verse , and God is more knowledgeable with what He descends, they said: "But you are a fabricator/cutter and splitter." Rather most of them do not know
Say: "The Holy/Sanctimonious Soul/Sprit descended it from your Lord with the truth to affirm/strengthen those who believed, and guidance, and a good news to the Moslems/submitters/surrenderers
And We have known that they say: "But/indeed a human teaches/instructs him, (the) tongue/language/speech (of) those who deviate, insult and defame to Him, non-Arabic/Persian (tongue/language/speech), and this (is) an Arabic clear/evident tongue/language/speech

But/indeed (who) fabricates/cuts and splits the lies/defiance/falsehood (are) those who do not believe with God`s verses/evidences , and those, they are liars/deniers/falsifiers
Who disbelieved with God after his faith/believing , except who was compelled/forced, and his heart/mind (is) assured/tranquillised/secured with the faith/belief, and but who delighted/expanded his chest (innermost) to the disbelief, so on them anger from God and for them (is) a great torture

And you see the sun when it rose/ascended/appeared, it bends and curves/visits on their cave that of the right, and when it departed/declined/set, it parallels/crosses/passes them that of the left, and they are in an opening from it; that (is) from God`s verses/signs/evidences; whom God guides so he is the guided, and whom He misguides/who misguides (others) so you will never/not find for him a guardian/ally a correct/right guide
And you think/suppose them (to be) awake/alert, and they are asleep/lying down, and We turn them/turn them around that of the right (side), and that of the left (side), and their dog (is) spreading/extending its two arms (paws) at the cave/doorstep/mountain , if you saw/looked on/over them you would have turned away from them escaping/fleeing/running away, and you would have been filled (by) terror/fright from them
And as/like that We sent/resurrected/revived them to ask/question each other between them, a speaker from them said: "How much (have) you stayed/remained ?" They said: "We stayed/remained a day or part of a day." They said: "Your Lord (is) more knowledgeable with what you stayed/remained , so send one of you with this your paper/money to the city/town so he looks/watches/waits (E) which/what (is a) more pure/correct food, so he comes to you with a provision/means of livelihood from it, and (he) should be courteous/polite , and do not make anyone feel/know/sense with (about) you
That they truly if they see and know of/overcome on you, they stone you, or they return you in (to) their religion/faith, and you will never/not win/succeed then ever (E)
And as/like that We made be stumbled upon on them (We made them be stumbled upon) to know that God`s promise (is) truth , and that (E) the Hour/Resurrection (there is) no doubt/suspicion in it, when they dispute/argue their matter/affair between them, so they said: "Build/construct on them a building/structure, their Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (of) them." Those who defeated/overcame on their matter/affair said: "We will take (E) on them a mosque/place of worshipping God
They will say: "Three, their fourth (is) their dog." And they say: "Five, their sixth (is) their dog." An unsubstantiated guess with the unseen/absent , and they say: "Seven and their eighth (is) their dog." Say: "My Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (of) their number, none knows them except few/little , so do not argue/discuss in (about) them, except apparent/visible argument/discussion, and do not take (an) opinion/a clarification (of)anyone from them in (about) them
And do not say (E) to a thing: "That I am making/doing that tomorrow/(in the) future
Except that (E) God wills/wants, and mention/remember your Lord if you forgot, and say: "Maybe/perhaps that (E) my Lord guides me to nearer/closer than that (a) correct/right guidance
And they stayed/remained in their cave three hundred years and they were increased (by) nine (years)
Say: "God (is) more knowledgeable with what they stayed/remained , for Him (are) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s unseen/invisible , see/look/understand with Him, and make (to) hear/listen, (there is) none for them from other than Him (as a) guardian/ally , and He does not share/make partners in His judgment/rule anyone
And read/recite what was inspired/transmitted to you from your Lord`s Book , (there is) no exchanger/replacer/substitutor to His words/expressions, and you will never/not find from other than Him a shelter/refuge

And say: "The truth (is) from your Lord, so who willed/wanted, so he should believe, and who willed/wanted, so he should disbelieve, that We have prepared/made ready to the unjust/oppressive a fire, its elevated surrounding ash/smoke encircled/enveloped with them, and if they seek/ask for help (rain) they be helped/aided/rained upon with water as the dead`s pus/refined oil , (it) roasts/grills the faces/fronts, how bad (is) the drink? And it was a bad/evil/harmful convenience/benefit
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, we (E)do not loose/waste (the) reward (of) whom did good deed(s)
Those are for them treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath/below them, they be bejeweled/decorated in it from bracelets from gold, and they dress/wear green clothes/garments from sarcenet (a certain type of silk or brocade), and brocade (silk and gold fabric), leaning/reclining/resting on the luxurious beds/couches in it, blessed/praised (is) the reward/compensation , and (it) became a good/beautiful companion/convenience
And give for them an example/proverb (of) two men, We made/created to one of them two treed gardens from grapes, and We surrounded/encircled them (B) with palm trees, and We made/put between them (B) plants/crops
Each of them (B) the two treed gardens gave/brought its food/fruits and (it) did not cause injustice from it a thing, and We caused to flow/burst in between and around it a river/waterway
And for him was fruit, so he said to his companion/friend and he, he is discussing/debating with him: "I am more than you (in) property/possession/wealth and more powerful (in) a group/family/tribe
And he entered his treed garden and he is unjust/oppressive to himself, he said: "I do not think/suppose that this be destroyed/perished ever (E)
And I do not think/suppose (that) the Hour/Resurrection (is) starting , and if (E) I returned to my Lord I will find (E) better than it a place of return
His companion/friend said to him and he is discussing/debating with him: "Did you disbelieve with Who created you from dust/earth then from a drop/male`s or females` secretion , then He straightened you (into) a man
But/however I, (to me) He is God my Lord, and I do not share/make partners with my Lord anyone
And if only when you entered your treed garden, you said: `What God willed/wanted! No strength/power except by God,` if you see me, I am less/fewer than you (in) property/possession/wealth and children
So maybe/perhaps my Lord that He gives/brings me better than your treed garden, and He sends on it thunder storms/small arrows from the sky/space, so it becomes/becomes in the morning slippery/slithery dust
Or its water becomes/becomes in the morning deep/deeply sunk/bottomed, so you will never/not be able for it seeking/wanting (be unable to retrieve water)
And (he) was surrounded/encircled with his fruit, so he became/became in the morning, he turns/turns around/turns over his two palms, on (about) what he spent in it, and it is fallen/destroyed/empty on its branches/grape vines and he says: "Oh I wish I would have not shared/made partners with my Lord anyone
And (there) was not for him a group they give him victory from other than God, and he was not a victorious
At that place and time the ownership/might (is) to God, the truth , He is (the) best (in) reward/replacement/compensation and best (in) an end
And give to them the life the present`s/worldly life`s example/proverb as water, We descended it from the sky , so the land`s/Earth`s plant mixed/mingled with it, so it became/became in the morning dried and broken plants/trees, the winds/breezes scatter/spread/winnow it (the water) and God was/is on every thing capable/able/powerful
The property/possession/wealth and the sons/sons and daughters (are) the life the present`s/worldly life`s decoration/beauty , and the remainders the correct/righteous deeds (are) better at your Lord (in) a reward/replacement , and better hope
And a day We move/manipulate the mountains and you see the earth/Planet Earth emerging/appearing, and We gathered them, so We did not leave out from them anyone
And they were displayed/exhibited on (to) your Lord (in) a row/line/arranged (and told): "You had come to Us as We created you (on the) first/beginning time , but you claimed/alleged that We not make for you an appointment
And The Book was put/laid/raised , so you see the criminals/sinners afraid/cautious from what (is) in it, and they say: "Oh our calamity/scandal , what to that The Book , (it) does not leave out small/little and nor big/great except it counted/computed it ?" And they found what they made/did present, and your Lord does not cause injustice/oppression (to) anyone
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam, so they prostrated except Satan/Iblis (he) was from the Jinns/an intelligent free willing creature created before man , so he debauched from his Lord`s order/command , do you take him and his descendants (as) guardians/allies from other than Me? And they are for you an enemy, and how bad to the unjust/oppressive an exchange/replacement/substitution
I did not make them witness/testify the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s creation, and nor creation (of) themselves, and I was not taking the misguiders (as) support/help/assistance
And a day , He says: "Call my partners those whom you claimed/alleged ." So they called them, so they did not answer/reply to them, and We made/put between them a barrier/shut off
And the criminals/sinners saw/understood the fire, so they thought/assumed that they (are)203falling/landing/expecting in it, and they did not find from it a diversion/return
And We had laid out/detailed linguistically in this the Koran to the people from every example/proverb, and the human/mankind was (the) most arguing/disputing thing
And what prevented/forbid the people that (E) they believe when the guidance came to them? And they ask for forgiveness (from) their Lord? Except that the first`s/beginner`s law/manner comes to them or the punishment comes to them in front/facing front
And We do not send the messengers except (as) announcers of good news and warners/givers of notice, and those who disbelieved argue/dispute with/by the falsehood to nullify with it the truth , and they took My verses/evidences and what they were warned/given notice (with it) mockingly/making fun
And who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who was reminded with his Lord`s evidences/signs/verses, so he objected/turned away from it, and he forgot what his two hands advanced/introduced/ undertook , We (E) had made/put covers/protections on their hearts/minds that they understand/know it , and in their ears deafness/weight , and if you call them to the guidance, so they will never/not be guided then ever (E)
And your Lord (is) the forgiving, (owner) of the mercy, if He punishes/takes them because (of)what they gained/gathered/acquired , He would have hurried/hastened for them the torture, but for them (is) an appointment, they will never/not find from other than it a shelter/refuge
And those are the villages/urban cities, We destroyed them when they caused injustice/oppression, and We made/put for their death/destruction an appointment
And when Moses said to his youth/servant , I will not leave/depart until I reach the two seas`/oceans`/rivers` place of meeting (point of joint), or I pass/complete a period of time
So when they (B) reached (a) place of meeting (point of joint) between them (B) (the two seas/oceans/rivers), they (B) forgot their (B)`s fish/large fish/whale, so it took/received its path in the sea/ocean/river sneaking away (it escaped into the body of water)
So when they (B) crossed/passed through he said to his youth/servant : "Give/bring us our breakfast/lunch, we had met/found hardship/fatigue from this our journey/voyage
He said: "Did you see/understand when we took refuge to the rock, so that I, I forgot the fish/large fish/whale and nothing made me forget it that I remember it except the devil, and it took/received its way path in the sea/ocean/river (in) astonishment/surprise/amazement
He said: "That (is) not (what) we were wishing/desiring ." So they (B) returned on their (B)`s tracks/marks following/tracking
So they (B) found a worshipper/slave from Our worshippers/slaves, We gave/brought him from at Us mercy, and We taught/instructed him from at Us knowledge
Moses said to him: "Do I follow you, on that you teach/instruct me from what you were taught/instructed correct/right guidance
He said: "That you will never/not be able (to have) patience with me
And how (do) you be patient on what you did not comprehend/encircle with it a knowledge/information
He Said: "You will find me if God wanted/willed patient, and I (will) not disobey for you an order/command
He Said: "So if you followed me, so do not ask/question me on (about) a thing, until I initiate/tell to you from it a reminder/remembrance
So they (B) left/set out until when they (B) rode/boarded in the ship/boat, he made a hole/opening (in) it, he (Moses) said: "Did you make a hole/opening (in) it to drown/sink its people ? You had come (with) a strange/denied thing

He said: "If I asked/questioned you , about a thing after it, so do not accompany/befriend me, you had reached an excuse from at me
So they (B) left/set out until when they (B) came (to) a village/urban city, they asked its people to be fed, so they refused/hated that they have them (B) as guests/help them , so they (B) found in it a wall wanting that to fall down/be wrecked, so he raised it, he (Moses) said: "If you wanted/willed you would have taken/received on (for) it a wage/fee
He said: "This (is) separation between me and between you, I will inform you with (an) explanation/interpretation on (of) what you were not able (to have) patience on it
As for the ship/boat, so it was to (owned by) poorest of poor/poor oppressed working in the sea/ocean/river , so I wanted that I defect it , and behind them was a king he takes/receives every ship/boat forcefully/unjustly/violently
And as for the boy/servant , so his parents were believing, so We feared that he burdens/oppresses them (with) tyranny/arrogance and disbelief
So We wanted/intended that their (B)`s Lord exchanges/substitutes (for) them (B) better than him and purification/correction and nearer/closer (in) mercy/relation
And as for the wall, so it was (belonging) to two boys , two orphans in the city/town, and under it was a treasure/buried treasure for them (B), and their (B)`s father was correct/righteous, so your Lord wanted/willed that they (B) reach their (B)`s maturity/strength, and they (B) bring out their (B)`s treasure/buried treasure, mercy from your Lord, and I did not make/do it from my matter/affair, that (is) explanation/interpretation (of) what you were not able (to have) patience on it
And they ask/question you about (owner) of the two horns/powers/glories , Say: "I will read/recite on (to) you from him a reminder/remembrance
We have highly positioned/strengthened for him in the earth/Planet Earth, and We gave/brought him from every thing a reason/motive/connection
So he followed a reason/motive/connection
Until when he reached the sun`s sunset/west , he found it departing/declining (setting) in (at a) water well/spring mixed with black (foul) mud, and he found at it a nation, We said: "You (owner) of the two horns/powers/glories, either that you torture, and either you take in them a goodness/beauty
He said: "As for who caused injustice/oppression, so we will/shall torture him, then he be returned to his Lord, so He tortures him an awful/obscene/severe torture
And as for who believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so to him the best`s/goodnesses` reward/reimbursement , and we will say to him from our order/matter ease/flexibility
Then he followed a reason/motive/connection
Until when he reached the sun`s place and time of appearance/ascent , he found it appears/ascends/rises on a nation We did not make/put from other than it a cover/protection/shelter
Like that, and We had comprehended/enveloped with what (is) at/near him (with) knowledge
Then he followed a reason/motive/connection
Until when he reached between the two barriers/obstacles/mountains , he found from other than them (B) a nation they are not about to/almost understand a saying/opinion and belief
They said: "You (owner) of the two horns/powers/glories, that Yagog and Magog (are) corrupting in the earth/Planet Earth, so do we make/put for you (a) royalty/retainer/expense/tribute on that you put/create between us and between them a barrier/obstacle
He said: "What my Lord highly positioned/strengthened/empowered me in it (is) best , so help/support me with power/strength , I make/create/put between you and between them a blockage/barrier
Give/bring me the huge pieces of iron. Until when he straightened/leveled/equalized between the two sides/directions/mountain sides , he said: "Blow." Until when he made it a fire, he said: "Give/bring me, I pour on it molten copper/brass/iron
So they did not rise/diffuse/spread over (it, nor) that they mount/ascend it , and they were not able (of) piercing/penetration for it
He said: "That (is) mercy from my Lord, so if my Lord`s promise came, he made it flattened/leveled off and my Lord`s promise was truthfully (truthful)
And We left some/part of them (on) that day (to) trouble/agitate (interlock) in some/part, and the horn/bugle/instrument was blown in, so We gathered/collected them all together
And We displayed/presented Hell (on) that day to the disbelievers a display/exhibition
Those who their eyes/sights were in a cover/concealment from My remembrance/reminder, and they were not being able (of) hearing/listening
Did those who disbelieved think/suppose that they take My worshippers/slaves (as) guardians/allies from other than Me? We have prepared/made ready for the disbelievers Hell (as) a place of descent
Say: "Do We inform you with the most losers (in their) deeds
Those whom their endeavors/striving (was) wasted/lost in the life the present/worldly life and they, they206think/suppose that they, they do good work/performance
Those are those who disbelieved with their Lord`s verses/evidences and meeting Him, so their deeds failed/wasted, so We do not take care of (evaluate) for them a weight/measure (on) the Resurrection Day
That (is) their reward/reimbursement , Hell because (of) what they disbelieved, and they took My verses/evidences and My messengers mockingly/making fun
That (E) those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, (the) treed garden/Paradise (of) the treed garden/Paradise/Elferdowse (one of the Paradises) was for them (as) a place of descent
Immortally/eternally in it, they do not wish/desire (away) from it (a) change/removal/movement
Say: "If the sea/ocean was ink/writing liquid for my Lord`s words/expressions, the sea/ocean would have been depleted/exhausted (E) before that my Lord`s words/expressions deplete/exhaust , and even if We came with equal/alike to it (to the sea/ocean) (for) ink/writing liquid (as) an extension/spread
Say: "Truly I am (a) human equal/alike to you, (it) is being inspired/transmitted to me that your God (is) one God, so who was hoping/expecting his Lord`s meeting, so he makes/does (E) correct/righteous deeds deed , and he does not share/make partners with worshipping his Lord anyone
K H Y EN S/C
Your Lord`s mercy mention (on) His worshipper/slave Zachary/Zacharias
When he called/cried (to) his Lord a hidden/secret call/cry
He said: "My Lord that I, the bones weakened/enfeebled from me, and the hair turned white or gray and my Lord I was not miserable/unhappy with calling you
And that I, I feared the followers/dependents from behind/beyond me, and my woman (wife) was infertile to grant/present for me from at you a follower/friend
(He) inherits me and (he) inherits from Jacob`s family, and my Lord make him accepted/approved/satisfied
You Zacharias/Zachary , that We, We announce good news to you with a boy , his name (is) John/Yahya , We did not make for him from before (an) equivalent/equivalent in height/position
He said: "My Lord that how (could there) be for me a boy and my woman (wife) was infertile and I had reached from the old age exceeding the limit
He said: "Like that." Your Lord said: "It is on Me easy/light , and I had created you from before, and you were not a thing
He said: "My Lord, make/put for me a sign/evidence." He said: "Your sign/evidence (is) that you do not converse/talk (to) the people three nights straight
So he emerged on (to) his nation, from the center of the assembly/the prayers` niche , so he inspired/transmitted/signaled to them that praise/glorify (at) daybreaks/early mornings and evenings/first darkness/dinnertime
You John/Yahya, take The Book with power/strength, and We gave/brought him the judgment/rule (as) a boy/child/infant
And compassion/kindness from at Us, and purification/correction and he was fearing and obeying
And righteous/obedient with his parents, and he was not a disobedient tyrant/rebel
And security/peace on him (on the) day he was born and (the) day he dies, and (the) day he be sent/resurrected/revived alive
And remember/mention in The Book Mary when she distantly isolated herself from her family/relation (to) an easterly/eastern place/position
So she took from other than them a divider/protection , so We sent to her Our Soul/Spirit , so he simulated/represented to her (as an) upright/average human
She said: "That I, I seek protection by the merciful from you, if you were fearing and obeying
He said: "Truly I am your Lord`s messenger to grant/present for you a pure/righteous boy
She said: "How/from where (there) be for me a boy and (a) human has not touched me, and I was not afornicatress/adulteress/prostitute
He said: "`Like that,` said your Lord, it is on Me easy/light , and to make/put him (as) a sign/evidence to the people, and mercy from Us, and (it was) a matter/command accomplished/ executed
So she was pregnant (with) him so she distantly isolated herself with him (to) a far/remote place/position
So the labour/childbirth came to her to (at) the palm tree`s trunk/stem, she said: "Oh I wish I would have died before this and I was forgotten (and long) forgotten
So he (Jesus) called her from below/beneath her: "That do not be sad/grieving, your Lord had put below/beneath you a stream/clearance of a burden/generosity
And shake/move to(wards) you with the palm tree`s trunk/stem, it causes freshly harvested/gathered ripe/moist (dates) to fall/drop repeatedly on you
So eat and drink and be delighted/satisfied eye(s) (delight your eyes), so when you see anyone from the human, so say: `That I made a duty/vow (on myself) to the merciful, a fast , so I will not converse/speak the day/today (to) a human
So she came with him (to) her nation carrying him , they said: "You Mary, you had come (with) a strange and confusing thing
You Aaron`s sister, your father was not (a) human/man of bad/evil , and your mother was not an fornicatress/adulteress/prostitute
So she pointed/indicated to him, they said: "How (do) we converse/speak (to) whom was in the crib/cradle a boy/child/infant
He said: "That I am God`s worshipper/slave, He gave/brought me The Book and He made me a prophet
And He made me blessed, wherever I was/am, and He directed/commanded me with the prayers and the charity/purification as long as I continued/lasted alive
And charitable/obedient with my mother, and He did not make me a miserable/unhappy tyrant/rebel
And the security/peace (was) on me (on the) day I was born, and (the) day I die, and (the) day I be sent/resurrected/revived alive
That (was) Jesus Mary`s son, the correct/real saying/opinion and belief which they (are) doubting/arguing in it
(It) was not to God that (He) take from a child/children (son), His praise/glory, if He ordered/executed amatter/command , so but He says to it: "Be, so it becomes
And that God (is) my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him, that (is) a straight/direct road/way
So the groups/parties differed/disagreed/disputed from between them, so grief/distress to those who disbelieved from an assembly of a great day
Make (to) hear/listen with them, and make to see/understand , a day they come to Us, but the unjust/oppressive today (are) in evident misguidance
And warn/give them notice (of) the Grief`s Day/Resurrection Day, when the matter/affair was accomplished/carried out , and they are in negligence/disregard, and they are not believing
That We, We inhabit the earth/Planet Earth, and who (is) on it, and to Us they return
And remember/mention in The Book Abraham, that he truly was an always very truthful prophet
When he said to his father: "You my father, for what (do) you worship what does not hear/listen, and nor see/understand , and nor enrich/suffice from you a thing
You my father, that I, (it) had come to me from the knowledge, what did not come to you, so follow me, I guide you a straight/level road/way
You my father, do not worship the devil, that the devil was/is to the merciful disobedient
You my father, that I fear that torture touches you from the merciful, so you be to the devil an ally/follower
He said: "Are you shunning/turning away from my gods, you Abraham? If (E) you do not end/terminate/stop, I will stone you, and leave/distance me a long/life time
He said: "Security/peace on you, I will ask for forgiveness for you (from) my Lord, that He truly (was) with me generous/blessing
And I separate/isolate myself from you and what you call from other than God, and I call my Lord, maybe/perhaps that I not be with my Lord`s call/prayer miserable/unhappy
So when he separated/isolated himself from them, and what they call from other than God, We granted for him Issac , and Jacob and each/all, We made a prophet
And We granted for them from Our mercy, and We made for them (a) truthful high and mighty/dignified tongue/language/speech
And remember/mention in The Book Moses, that he truly was faithful/loyal/devoted and (he) was a messenger, a prophet
And We called him from the mountain`s side/direction, the right (side), and We neared/approached him secretly conversing
And We granted for him from Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet
And remember/mention in The Book Ishmael , that he truly was truthful (in) the promise, and was a messenger, a prophet
And (he) was ordering/commanding his family/people with the prayers and the charity/purification, and (he) was at his Lord accepted/approved
And remember/mention in The Book Idris, that he truly was always very truthful, and a prophet
And We raised him a high and mighty/dignified place/position
Those are those who God blessed/praised on them from the prophets from Adam`s descendants; and from who We carried with Noah, , and from Abraham`s and Ishmael`s descendants, and from who We guided and We chose/purified, if the merciful`s verses/evidences are read/recited on them they fell down prostrating and weeping
So succeeded/followed from after them a succession , they lost/wasted/destroyed the prayers, and they212followed the lusts/desires/cravings, so they will/shall meet/find misguidance/failure
Except who repented and believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so those, they enter the Paradise, and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed a thing
Treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence which the merciful promises His worshippers/slaves with the unseen/hidden , that He truly, His promise was/is coming (E)
They do not hear/listen in it nonsense/senseless talk , except (a) greeting/safety/peace and for them, (is) their provision in it (at) daybreaks/early mornings and (at) evening/first darkness/dinnertime
That (is) the paradise which We make inherit (to) who was fearing and obeying from Our worshippers/slaves
And We do not descend except with your Lord`s order/command, for Him what (is) between Our hands, and what (is) behind Us, and what (is) between that, and your Lord was not frequently forgetting
The skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s and what (is) between them (B)`s Lord, so worship Him, and endure patience to His worshipping, do you know (an) equivalent to Him
And the human/mankind says: "Is (it that) if I died, I will/shall (E) be brought out alive! ."(expression of wonderment)
Or does not the human remember that We created him from before and (he) was not a thing
So by your Lord We will gather them (E), and the devils, then We will present/bring them (E) around Hell kneeling/standing on (their) toes
Then We will remove (E) from every group/party which of them (is) stronger arrogant/disobedience on (to) the merciful
Then We are (E) more knowledgeable with (about) those who, they are more worthy/deserving roasting/suffering/burning with (in) it (Hell)
And that from you (there is not) except (who is) nearing/approaching it , (that) was on (by) your Lord decidedly/positively ordered/executed
Then We save/rescue those who feared and obeyed, and We leave (disregard) the unjust/oppressors in it kneeling/standing on (their) toes
And when Our evidences/verses evidences are read/recited on (to) them, those who disbelieved said to those who believed: "Which (of) the two groups/parties/flocks is (in) better residence and best gathering/assembly/club
And how many We destroyed from before them from people of one era/generation/century? They are better home effects/money and appearance/pleasant appearance
Say: "Who was in the misguidance, so the merciful will extend/spread (E) for him extension/spreading until when they saw/understood what they are being promised, either the torture, and either the Hour/Resurrection , so they will know who he is worst (in) a place/position, and weaker soldiers/warriors
And God increases those who were guided (in) guidance, and the remainders the correct/righteous deeds (are) better at your Lord a replacement/compensation and better (in) a return
So did you see/understand who disbelieved with Our evidences/verses, and said: "I will be given213property/possession/wealth and children
Has he seen/been informed (of) the unseen/absent , or he took/received at the merciful a promise/contract
No but, We will write/dictate what he says, and We extend/spread to him from the torture extension/spreading
And We make him inherit what he says, and he comes to Us singly/alone
And they took/received from other than God gods, to be for them glory/might/honour
No but they will disbelieve with their worshipping, and they (are) on them adversaries/opponents
Do you not see/understand that We sent the devils on (to) the disbelievers, they penetrate their minds/influence them penetration of their minds/influence
So do not hurry/hasten/rush on them, but We count for them counting
A day We gather the fearing and obeying to the merciful (as) a delegation of dignitaries
And We drive (herd) the criminals/sinners to Hell successively in groups
They do not own/possess the mediation, except who took/received at the merciful a promise/contract
And they said: "The merciful took/received a child (son)
You had come (with) a blasphemous/disastrous thing
The skies/space are about to/almost split/crack/cleave from it, and the earth/Planet Earth splits/cracks open ,and the mountains fall down (in) demolition and breaking down into pieces violently with noise
That (E) they called to the merciful a child (son)
And (it) would not (be) to the merciful that He takes a child (son)
That every/each whom (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth except is coming (E) (to) the merciful (as) a worshipper/slave
He had counted/completed them and He counted them counting
And all of them are coming to Him (in) the Resurrection Day singly/alone/one
That those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, the merciful will make/create for them love/affection
So but We eased it with your tongue/language, to announce good news with it (to) the fearing and obeying, and warn/give notice with it (to) a nation (in) harsh/violent dispute
And how many before them We destroyed from people of one era/generation/century, do you sense/feel from them from anyone, or hear for them (a) low voice/whisper/faint sound
T H
We did not descend the Koran on you to (to) be miserable/unhappy
Except (as) a reminder to who fears
Descent from who created the earth/Planet Earth and the skies/space, the high/elevated
The merciful on the throne He aimed to/sat on/straightened
For Him what (is) in the skies/space, and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and what (is) between them (B), and what (is) below/beneath the moist dust/earth
And if you publicize/declare with the saying/word/opinion and belief , so that He truly knows the secret and (what is) more hidden
God, no god except Him, for Him (are) the names the best/most beautiful
And did Moses`, information/speech come to you
When he saw a fire, so he said to his family: "Wait/remain/stay, that I , I perceived/saw a fire, maybe/perhaps I come to you from it with a fire`s flame/torch, or I find on (at) the fire guidance
So when he came to it, (it) was called: "You Moses
That I, I am your Lord, so take off your two shoes , that you are at the Valley the Holy/Hallowed/Sanctified/Blessed Tuwan/wrapped within (itself)
And I, I chose you, so hear/listen to what is inspired/transmitted
That I , I am God, no god except Me, so worship Me, and keep up/start the prayers for mentioning/remembering Me (E)
That (E) the Hour/Resurrection is coming, I am about to/almost, I hide it, (so) each self (is) to be rewarded/reimbursed because (of) what it strives/endeavors
So who does not believe with it and he followed his self attraction for desire does not object/prevent/obstruct you from it, so you fall/be destroyed
And what (is) that at your right (hand) you, Moses
He said: "It is my stick/cane, I lean on/support myself on it, and I hit/move/shake with it on my sheep and goats, and for me in it others needs/purposes
He said: "Throw it away, you Moses
So he threw it away, so then it is (a) quick moving snake/alive
He said: "Take it and do not fear, We will return it (to) its form , the first/beginning
And gather/join (fold) your hand to your wing/side, it appears/emerges white with no evil/harm , another evidence/sign
To show you/make you understand (E) from Our evidences/signs the greatest/biggest
Go to Pharaoh, that he truly tyrannized
He said: "My Lord expand/delight for me, my chest (innermost)
And ease/make flexible for me my matter/affair
And untie/undo (the) difficulty/knot from my tongue/speech
They understand/know my speech
And make/put for me a minister/supporter from my family/relation
Aaron, my brother
Strengthen/support with him my power
And share him/make him a partner in my matter/affair
So that/in order that we praise/glorify you much
And we mention/remember you much
That you were/are with us seeing/knowing
He said: "You had been given your request/question, you Moses
And We had blessed on you another time
When We inspired/transmitted to your mother what is being inspired/transmitted
That throw/hurl him in the box/chest so throw/hurl him in the body of water (sea/river/lake), so the body of water (sea/river/lake) will throw him by the shore/(river) bank/coast. An enemy for Me, and an enemy for him takes/receives him; and I threw on you love/affection from Me, and to be made on My sight/watchfulness/protection
And when your sister walks, so she says: Do I guide/lead you on (to) who maintains him ?" So We returned you to your mother, in order that her eye/sight delight/satisfy , and nor she be saddened/grieved, and you killed a self so We saved/rescued you from the grief/sadness/depression, and We tested you , testfully , so you stayed/remained years in Madya`s people , then you came on a predestiny you Moses
And I made you for My self
Go, you and your brother with My evidences/signs/verses, and do not weaken/relax in mentioning/remembering Me
You (B) go to Pharaoh, that he truly, he tyrannized
So you (B) say to him a lenient/flexible saying/opinion and belief, maybe/perhaps he mentions/remembers, or fears
They (B) said: "Our Lord, that we truly fear that he hastens/abuses on us or that he tyrannizes
He said: "Do not fear (B), that I am (E) with you (B), I hear/listen, and I see/understand
So you (B) come to him, so you (B) say: We (E) are your Lord`s two messengers, so send with us Israel`s sons and daughters, and do not torture them, We had come to you with a sign/evidence from your Lord, and the greeting/safety/security on who followed the guidance
We (E) had been inspired/transmitted to us that the torture (is) on who lied/denied/falsified and turned away
He said: "So who (is) your (B)`s Lord, you Moses
He said: "Our Lord (is) who gave/granted every thing its creation then He guided
He said: "So what (about the) affair/condition (of) the first/beginning generations/centuries
He said: "Its knowledge (is) at my Lord in a Book , my Lord does not misguide and nor forgets
Who made/put for you the earth/Planet Earth spread , and He threaded/passed for you in it roads/means , and He descended from the sky water, so We brought out with it pairs/spouses from different/various plants
Eat and graze/pasture your camels/livestock, that truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to (owners) of the minds/reasoning/powers
From it We created you, in it We return/repeat you, and from it We bring you out another once/again
And We had shown him/made him understand from Our verses/evidences/signs all of it, so he denied/falsified and refused/hated
He said: "Did you come to us to bring us out from our land/Earth with your magic/sorcery, you Moses
So we will come to you, with magic/sorcery equal/alike to it, so make/put between us and between you an appointment we do not break it, we and nor you, a place/position equally distanced/just
He said: "Your appointment (is) day (of) the decoration/beauty/ornament, and that the people be gathered at sunrise/daybreak
So Pharaoh turned away, so he gathered/collected his plot/deceit then he came
Moses said to them: "Your calamity/scandal/grief , do not fabricate/cut and split on (about) God lies/falsifications , so He destroys/uproots you with a torture, and who fabricated/cut and split had failed/despaired
So they disputed/quarreled their matter/affair between them, and they kept the secret conversation secret
They said: "That those two (are) two magicians/sorcerers (E), they (B) want/intend that they (B) bring you out from your land/Earth with their (B)`s magic/sorcery, and they (B) go/eliminate with your way/religious approach/habit the best example
So gather/collect your plot/deceit then come/bring (it in) a row/line , and had succeeded/won today who (is) defeated/overcame, and became dignified
They said: "You Moses either that you throw , or that we be first who threw
He said: "Rather you throw ." So then their ropes/ties and their sticks/canes is imagined/believed to him from their magic/sorcery that it hastens/moves quickly
So he felt inner horror/fear in himself hiddenly/secretly Moses
We said: "Do not fear, that you, you are the highest/mightiest
And throw/throw away what (is) in your right (hand), it snatches/swallows quickly what they made/performed , truly they made/performed a magician`s/sorcerer`s plot/deceit/manipulation , and the magician/sorcerer does not succeed/win where/when he came/destroyed
So the magicians/sorcerers were thrown/thrown away prostrating, they said: "We believed with (in) Aaron`s and Moses` Lord
He said: "You believed to him before that I permit for you, that he truly (is) your biggest/greatest (E) who taught/instructed you the magic/sorcery, so I will cut off/sever (E) your hands and your feet from opposites (sides), and I will crucify you (E) in the palm trees` trunks/stems, and you will know (E) which of us (is) stronger (in) torture and more lasting
They said: "We will never/not prefer/choose you over what came to us from the evidences, and who created/brought us into being , so order/execute what you are ordering/executing but you (only) destroy/end this the life the present/worldly life
We (E) believed with our Lord, to forgive for us our sins/mistakes and what you compelled/forced us on it from the magic/sorcery, and God (is) best and more remaining (everlasting)
That truly he, who comes (to) his Lord a criminal/sinner, so that to him (is) Hell he does not die in it and nor lives
And who comes to Him believing, he had made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so those, for them the stages/degrees the high/elevated
Treed gardens (as) eternal residence, the rivers/waterways flow/pass from beneath/below it, immortally/eternally in it, and that (is) who purified`s/corrected`s reward/reimbursement
And We had inspired/transmitted to Moses that walk/move with My worshippers/slaves so strike/move adry a path/way in the sea/ocean , do not fear over taking/pursuit , and nor you (should) fear
So Pharaoh followed them with his soldiers/warriors, so from the body of water covered/afflicted them what covered/afflicted them (so they drowned in the water)
And Pharaoh misguided his nation, and he did not guide
You Israel`s sons and daughters, We had saved/rescued you from your enemy and We promised you the mountain`s right side/direction, and We descended on you the manna/sap , and the quail/amusement
Eat from tasty/goodnesses what We provided for you, and do not tyrannize/exceed the limit in it, so My anger takes place/descends on you, and whom My anger descends on him, so he had fallen/dropped
And that I am forgiving often/a forgiver (E) to who repented and believed and made/did correct/righteous deeds then was guided
And what made you hurry/hasten on from your nation, you Moses
He said: "They are, those on my track/trail, and I hurried/hastened to you, my lord, to approve/please (you)
He said: "So We had tested your nation from after you, and Elsamerey misguided them
So Moses returned to his nation, angry sorrowfully/angrily. He said: "My nation, did not your Lord promise you a good/beautiful promise, did the promise/contract become long/last long on you, or you wanted/intended that anger (be) placed on you from your Lord, so you broke my appointment
They said: "We did not break your appointment with our free will, and but we were burdened/made to carry 219weights/burdens from the nation`s decoration/beauty so we threw/hurled it, so as/like that Elsamerey/Samerey threw/threw away
So he brought out for them a body (of) a (M) calf, for him (is a) moo/bellow , so they said: "This (is) your god, and Moses` god." So he forgot
So do they not see/understand that it (does) not return to them a saying/words , and nor own/possess for them harm, and nor benefit/usefulness
And Aaron had said to them from before: "You my nation, truly you were tested with it, and that (E) your Lord (is) the merciful, so follow me, and obey my order/command
They said: We will never/not leave/depart on it, devoting/dedicating until Moses returns to us
He said: "You Aaron what prevented/forbid you when you saw/understood them misguided
That you not follow me, did you disobey my order/command
He said: "You son of my mother, do not take/receive by my beard , and nor with my head, that I, I feared, that you say: `You separated between Israel`s sons and daughters, and you did not observe/guard my saying/word
He said: "So what (is) your concern/matter you Samerey/Elsamerey
He said: "I saw with what they did not see/know with it, so I grasped/clutched a handful/grasp from the messenger`s trace/mark , so I discarded/rejected it, , and as/like that my self enticed/tempted for me
He said: "So go/go away , so then for you in the life that you say: `No touch/desperate need .`And that for you (is) an appointment you will never/not break it, and look/see to your God whom you continue/remain on him devoting/dedicating , we will burn him (E), then we will uproot and disperse/destroy him (E) in the body of water uprooting and dispersing/destruction
Truly your God (is) God who (there is) no god except Him, He widened over every thing (with) knowledge
As/like that We narrator/inform on (to) you from information/news what had preceded , and We had brought to you from at Us a reminder/remembrance
Who objected/opposed/turned away from it, so that he truly carries/bears (on) the Resurrection Day a weight/burden
Immortally/eternally in it, and it became (an) evil/harmful weight/burden for them (on) the Resurrection Day
A day the horn/bugle is being blown in and We gather the criminals/sinners (on) that day blind/blue
They converse quietly between them, that you stayed/remained except ten
We are more knowledgeable with what they say, when their best example (in a) method/path says: "That (E) you stayed/remained except a day
And they ask/question you about the mountains , so say: "My Lord explodes/destroys it explosion/destruction
So He leaves it a plain and safe land even/level
You do not see in it crookedness/indirectness and nor difference in elevation/fault
(On) that day they follow the caller/requester, no crookedness/indirectness for it, and the voices/sounds silenced/humbled to the merciful, so you do not hear except whispering/quiet or subdued voices
(On) that day the mediation does not benefit/become useful, except whom the merciful permitted/allowed for him, and accepted/approved for him a saying/word
He knows what (is) between their hands and what (is) behind them, and they do not comprehend/envelope with (about) Him knowledge
And the faces/fronts submitted/humbled to the live/alive , the of no beginning and self sufficient , and who had carried/bore injustice/oppression had failed/despaired
And who makes/does from the correct/righteous deeds and he is believing, so he does not fear injustice/oppression, and nor anger/humiliation
And as/like that We descended it (as) an Arabic Koran, and We laid out/detailed linguistically in it from the threat, maybe/perhaps they fear and obey, or it initiates/originates/informs for them a reminder/remembrance
So high, mighty, exalted and dignified (is) God the owner/possessor/king, the truth , and do not hurry/hasten with the Koran from before that its transmission/revelation be carried out/executed to you, and say: "My Lord increase me knowledge
And We had promised/recommended to Adam from before so he forgot, and We did not find decisiveness/determination for him
And when We said to the angels: "Prostrate to Adam." So they prostrated except Satan/Iblis refused/hated
So We said: "You Adam, that (E) that (is) an enemy for you and to your wife/spouse, so let him not bring you (B) out from the Paradise, so you (will) be miserable/unhappy
That (E) for you, that you do not starve/be hungry in it, and nor naked/obscenely harmed
And that you do not be thirsty in it, and nor sun stricken/uncovered
So the devil inspired and talked to him, he said: "You Adam, do I guide you on (to) the immortality`s/eternity`s tree, and possession and free will/kingdom (that) does not wear out
So they ate from it, so their (B)`s shameful genital private parts to be covered appeared to them (B), and they (B) started and continued (to) stick (B) on them (B) from the Paradise`s leaves , and Adam disobeyed his Lord, so he was misguided/failed
Then His Lord chose/purified him, so He forgave on him, and guided
He said: "You (B) descend/drop from it all together , some of you to some (you are to each other) an enemy, so when guidance from Me comes to you, so who followed My guidance, so he does not become misguided and nor become miserable/unhappy
And who objected/turned away from My remembrance/reminder, so then for him (is a) narrow tight/weak life/livelihood , and We gather him (on) the Resurrection Day blind/confused
He said: "My Lord why (have) you gathered me blind/confused and I had been seeing/understanding
He said: "Like that, Our verses/evidences/signs came to you so you forgot it, and like that today you be forgotten
And like that We reimburse who extravagated/exceeded the limit, and did not believe with his Lord`s verses/evidences , and the end`s (other life`s) torture (E) (is) stronger (severer) and more lasting (everlasting)
Did He not guide to them how many from the generations/peoples of eras before them We made die/destroyed , they walk in their residences, that (E) in that (are) verses/evidences/signs (E) to (owners) of the minds/reasoning powers
And was it not for a word/sermon preceded from your Lord, (it) would have been necessity/obligation and (a) named/identified term/time
So you be patient on what they say, and praise/glorify with your Lord`s praise/gratitude/thanks, before the sun`s ascent/rising, and before its decline/setting , and from the night`s hours so praise/glorify, and the daytime`s ends/edges, maybe/perhaps you accept/approve
And do not extend/spread your two eyes to what We gave long life/made enjoy with it (to) spouses/couples from them, the life the present`s/worldly life`s flower/splendor , to test them in it, and your Lord`s provision (is) better and more lasting
And order/command your family/people with the prayers and endure patience on it, We do not ask/question you (for) a provision/means of livelihood , We provide for you, and the end (result is) to the fear and obedience (of God)
And they said: "If only, he comes/brings to us with a verse/evidence/sign from his Lord." Did not an evidence (of) what is in the written leaves/sheets/pages (books/scriptures) the first/beginning come to them
And if that (E) We destroyed/made them die with torture from before it, they would have said: "Our Lord, if only you sent to us a messenger, so we follow your signs/verses/evidences, from before that we humiliate/disgrace, and we shame/scandalize (ourselves)
Say: "Each/all (is) waiting/remaining , so wait/remain , so you will know who (are) the road`s/way`s the straight/just owners/company , and who was guided
Their account/calculation neared/approached to the people, and they are in negligence/disregard objecting/opposing
None from a remembrance/reminder initiated/originated from their Lord, comes to them except they heard/listened (to) it and (while) they are playing/amusing
Their hearts/minds are being distracted and they kept the confidential talk secret, those who caused injustice/oppression, is that except (a) human similar/equal to you? Do you do the magic/sorcery and you are seeing/understanding
He said: "My Lord knows the saying/opinion and belief in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable
But they said: "A confused mixture of dreams with no basis, rather he fabricated/cut and split it, rather he is a poet, so he should come/bring us with a verse/evidence/sign, as/like the first/beginners were sent
None from a village/urban city before them believed, (that) We made it die/destroyed it , so are they believing
And We did not send before you except men, We inspire/transmit to them, so ask/question the reminder`s/remembrance`s people if you were not knowing
And We did not make/create them a body, they do not eat the food, and they were not immortal/eternal
Then We were truthful to them (in) the promise, so We saved/rescued them and whom We will/want, and We destroyed the wasters/extravagators
We had descended to you a Book in it (is) your memory/mention , so do you not reason/understand
And how many from a village/urban city We destroyed/broke , (it) was unjust/oppressive, and We created/formed after it a nation (of) others
So when they felt with one of their physical senses Our might/power , then they are from it running (fleeing)
Do not run, and return to what you were luxuriated/ungrateful and arrogant in it and your residences, maybe/perhaps you be asked/questioned
They said: "Oh our calam ity that we, we were unjust/oppressive
So it was still/continuing that it (was) their call/prayer until We made them uprooted (and) silent/dead
And We did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) playing/amusing
If We wanted that We take a plaything/an amusement , We would have taken it from at Us, if We were making/doing
Rather We throw/hurl with the truth on the falsehood, so it nullifies/eliminates it (the falsehood), so then it(the falsehood) is vanishing/being destroyed , and for you (is) the grief/misfortune from what you describe/categorize
And for Him whom (is) between the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and whom (are) at Him do not be arrogant from worshipping Him, and they do not grieve/sadden
They praise/glorify (during) the night and the daytime, they do not subside/abate
Or they took/received gods from the earth/Planet Earth, they are reviving/resurrecting
If (there) was in them (B) (the skies and the Earth) gods, except God, they (B) would have been corrupted ,so praise/glory (to) God, Lord (of) the throne about what they describe/categorize
(He is) not to be asked/questioned about what He makes/does, and they are being asked/questioned
Or they took/received from other than Him gods, say: "Bring/give your proof/evidence that (is a) reminder/mention what (is) with me, and (a) reminder/mention what (is) before me, but most of them do not know the truth , so they are objecting/opposing
And We did not send from before you from a messenger, except (that) We inspire/transmit to him: "That He is no God except Me, so worship Me
And they said: "The merciful took/received a child (son) His praise/glory but honoured worshippers/slaves
They do not precede/race Him with the saying/opinion and belief, and they are with His order/command doing/working
He knows what (is) between their hands and what (is) behind them, and they do not mediate except to who He accepted/approved, and they are from His fear are guarding/cautious
And who says from them: "That I am a god from other than Him." So that/this, We reimburse him Hell, that is how We reimburse the unjust/oppressive
Did those who disbelieved not see that the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, they (B) were joined , so We split/ruptured them (B) , and We made/created from the water every thing alive/living, so do they not believe
And We made/created in the earth/Planet Earth anchors/mountains , that (E) it sways and leans/moves and unsettles with them, and We made/created in it wide mountain paths (as) roads/paths ,maybe/perhaps they be guided
And We made/created the sky/space a protected/guarded roof/ceiling, and they are from its verses/evidences/signs objecting/opposing
And He is who created the night and the daytime, and the sun and the moon, every/all in (an) orbit/circuit floating
And We did not make/create to a human from before you the immortality , so if you died so they are the immortals
Every self (is) tasting/experiencing the death/lifelessness, and We test you with the bad/harm and the good/generosity (as) a test , and to Us you are being returned
And if those who disbelieved saw you, that they take you except mockingly/making fun, is that who mentions/remembers your gods? And they are with mentioning/remembering the merciful they are225disbelieving
The human/mankind was created from hurry/haste/speed, I will show you My verses/evidences , so do not hurry/hasten
And they say: "When (is) that the promise if you were truthful
If those who disbelieved know when they do not prevent/stop the fire from their faces/fronts, and nor from their backs, and nor they, they be given victory/aid
But it comes to them suddenly/unexpectedly, so it amazes/surprises them, so they are not able (of) its return/returning it, and nor they be given time
And had been mocked/made fun of with messengers from before you, so surrounded with those who mocked from them, what they were with it mocking (so those who mocked were surrounded by their deeds)
Say: "Who guards/protects you by the night and the daytime from the merciful? But they are from mentioning/remembering their Lord objecting/opposing
Or (are) for them gods preventing/protecting them from other than/besides Us, (or are there Gods that protect them from Us), they are not able (of) victory/aid (to) themselves, and nor they are from Us being accompanied/befriended
But We gave long life/made those enjoy, and their fathers, until the lifetime became long/lasted long on them, so do they not see/understand that We come/bring (to) the earth/Planet Earth, We reduce/decrease/lessen it from its ends/edges, so are they the defeaters/conquerors
Say: "Truly I warn/give you notice with the inspiration/transmission , and the deaf does not hear the call/prayer if they are being warned/given notice
And if a blow/breath from your Lord`s torture touched them, they will say (E): "Oh our calamity , we (E) were unjust/oppressive
And We put the scales/measures the just/equitable to the Resurrection Day, so a self does not be caused injustice to/oppressed a thing, and (even) if (it) was a seed`s/grain`s weight of mustard/an herb, We brought it and enough/sufficient with Us counting/calculating
And We had given/brought (to) Moses and Aaron the Separator of Right and Wrong/Proof , and light/illumination , and a reminder/remembrance to the fearing and obeying
Those who fear their Lord with the unseen and they are from the Hour/Resurrection they are afraid/guarding
And that (is) a blessed reminder, We descended it, so are you to it denying/objecting
And We had given Abraham his correct/right guidance from before, and We were with (about) him knowing
When he said to his father and to his nation: "What (are) these the statues which you are to it devoting/dedicating
They said: "We found our fathers to it worshipping
He said: "You had been, you and your fathers in clear/evident misguidance
They said: "Did you come to us with the truth , or you are from the playing amusing
He said: "But your Lord (is) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s Lord, who created them (B) ,and I am on that from the witnessing/testifying
And by God, I will manipulate/fight/(destroy) (E) your idols/statues , after that you turn giving (your) backs

They said: "Who made/did that with our Gods? That he is from (E) the unjust/oppressive
They said: "We heard a youth/adolescent mentioning them, is said to him, Abraham
They said: "So come/bring with him on the people`s eyes/sights, maybe/perhaps they witness/testify
They said: "Did you make/do this with our Gods, you Abraham
He said: "But/rather their oldest/biggest , that, made/did it, so ask/question them, if they were speaking

Then they were turned upside down on their heads/tops, "You had known those do not speak
He said: "Do you worship from other than God what does not benefit you a thing, and nor harm you
Ugh to you, and to what you worship from other than God, so do you not reason/comprehend
They said: "Burn him, and give victory/aid (to) your gods, if you were making/doing (that)

And to God (is) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s ownership/kingdom , and to God (is) the end/destination
Do you not see/understand that God drives/eases gently clouds, then He unites/joins between it, then He makes it piled/accumulated , so you see the rain emerges from in between and around it, and He descends from the sky from mountains in it from hail , so He strikes with it whom He wills/wants , and He diverts it from whom He wills/wants, its lightning`s shine/flash almost eliminates with the eye sights/knowledge

God promised those who believed from you, and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, He makes them successors in the earth/Planet Earth, as He made successors those from before them, and to highly position/strengthen (E) for them their religion which He accepted/approved for them, He will exchange/replace them (E) safety/security from after their fear/fright, they worship Me, they do not share/made partners with Me a thing, and who disbelieved after that, so those are the debauchers

Do not make calling the messenger between you as calling some of you (to) some, God had been know(ing) those who sneak/slip away taking refuge/dodging from you, so those who differ/disagree from His order/command should be warned/cautious that misguidance/seduction or a painful torture strikes them

And what she was worshipping from other than God obstructed/prevented her , that she truly was from a disbelieving nation
(It) was said to her: "Enter the palace/tower ." So when she saw it, she thought/supposed it (was) a wide body of water , and she removed/uncovered from her two shins/legs, he said: "That it truly is a palace/tower smoothened and spread from clear glass/mirrors ." She said: "My Lord , that I caused injustice/oppression (to) myself, and I submitted/surrendered with Soliman, to God, the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord

So his nation`s answer/reply was not except that they said: "Bring/drive out Lot`s family from your village/urban city, that they are people purifying
So We saved/rescued him and his family/people, except his woman (wife), We predestined her from the remaining behind

And say: "The praise/gratitude/thanks (is) to God, He will show you/make you understand His verses/evidences , so you know it, and your Lord is not with ignoring/neglecting about/from what you make/do
T S M
Those are the Book`s verses/evidences, the clear/evident
We read/recite on you from Moses` information/news, and Pharaoh, with the truth to a nation believing
That Pharaoh became high, mighty and dignified in the earth/Planet Earth, and he made its people (into) groups/parties , he weakens a group of people from them, he slaughters their sons, and he shames/keeps alive their women, that he truly was from the corrupting/disordering
And We want/intend that We bless on those who were weakened in the earth/Planet Earth, and We make them leaders/examples, and We make them the heirs/inheritants
And We highly position/empower for them in the earth/Planet Earth, and We show Pharaoh and Haman and their (B)`s soldiers from them what they were warning/cautioning
And We inspired/transmitted to Moses` mother: "That breast feed him, so if you feared on (for) him, so throw him in the body of water and do not fear, and do not be sad/grieving, that We are returning him to you, and making him from the messengers
So Pharaoh`s family unintentionally found and picked him up, to be for them an enemy and sadness/grief, that truly Pharaoh and Haman and their (B)`s soldiers were erroneous/sinners
And Pharaoh`s woman (wife) said: "An eye`s delight/pleasure for me and for you, do not kill him, maybe/perhaps that he benefits us, or we take/receive him (as) a child (son): "And they do not feel/know/sense
And Moses` mother`s heart became/became in the morning empty, that truly she was about to/almost to show/uncover with him, where it not for that We strengthened/braced on her heart/mind , to be from the believers
And she said to his sister, track/follow him, so she saw/watched with him, from (a) distance and (while) they do not feel/know/sense
And We forbade/prohibited on him the wet nurses/breast feeders from before, so she said: "Do I guide/lead you on a house`s/home`s people they sponsor/maintain him for you, and they are for him faithful/sincere
So We returned him to his mother in order that her eye delights/satisfies and she not be saddened/grieved, and to know that God`s promise (is) truth , and but most of them do not know
And when he reached his maturity/strength and straightened/leveled (matured) , We gave/brought him judgment/rule and knowledge, and like that We reward/reimburse the good doers
And He entered the city/town at a time of negligence/disregard (unnoticed) from its people , so he found in it two men (B) fighting/killing each other, that from his group/party , and that from his enemy, so who (was) from his group/party seeked/asked him for help, on (against) who (was) from his enemy, so he struck himwith his fist so he killed on him, Moses, he said that (is) from the devils` work/deed , that he truly is an enemy, misguiding, clear/evident
He said: "My Lord, that I caused injustice (to) myself, so forgive for me." So He forgave for Him, that He truly is, He is the forgiving, the merciful
He said: "My Lord, with what you blessed on me, so I will never/not be a supporter/helper to the criminals/sinners
So he became in the city/town afraid/frightened, observing/guarding , so then who seeked victory/aid from him at the yesterday/past, he cries out/screams for his help, Moses said to him: "That you are a misguider/lurer (E) clear/evident
So when that he wanted/intended that he attacks violently with who he is an enemy to them (B) he said: "You Moses, do you intend/want that you kill me, as you killed a self at the yesterday/past, that you want/intend except that you be a tyrant/oppressor in the earth/Planet Earth, and you do not want that you be from the correcting/reconciliating
And a man came form the farthest of the city/town walking quickly/hastening he said: "You Moses, that the nobles/assembly , they conspire/plot with each other with (about) you, to kill you, so get out , that I am for you from the advisors/counselors
So he got out from it afraid/frightened, observing/guarding , he said: "My Lord save/rescue me, from the nation, the unjust/oppressive
And when he aimed/turned towards Madya , he said: "Maybe/perhaps my Lord that He guides me the road`s/path`s straightness
And when he neared/approached Madya`s water he found at it a nation/generation from the people, they water/irrigate and he found from other than them two women, (B) pushing/defending , he said: "What (is) your matter/concern ." They (B) said: "We do not water/irrigate until the shepherds/protectors return from the water/proceed , and our father (is) an old aged old
So he watered/gave drink for them (B), then he turned away to the shade/water shaded by trees , so he said: "My Lord, that I am to what you descended to me from goodness/wealth poor/deprived
So one of them (B) came to him, she walks on (with) shame/shyness, she said: "That my father calls you to reimburse you a wage/fee (for) what you watered/gave drink for us." So when he came to him, and he narrated/related on (to) him the narration/information (true stories) he said: "Do not fear, you were saved/rescued from the nation, the unjust/oppressive
One of them (B) said: "You my father, hire him, that best (of) who you hired, (is) the powerful/strong, the faithful/loyal
He said: "That I, I want , that I marry you to one (of) my two daughters, those two, on that you hire to me (yourself for) eight pilgrimages (years), so if you completed ten, so (it) is from at you, and I do not want that I make hardship/difficulty on you, you will find me, if God willed/wanted from the correct/righteous
He said: "That (is) between me and between you, whichever (of) the two terms/times I accomplished/carried out, so no transgression/aggression (be) on me, and God (is) on what we say a guardian
So when Moses accomplished the term/time, and he walked/moved/rode with his family , he perceived/ saw from the mountain`s side/direction a fire, he said to his family : "Wait/remain that I perceived/saw a fire, maybe/perhaps I come to you from it with news/information/knowledge, or a fire brand/burning ember from the fire, maybe/perhaps you warm (yourselves)
So when he came to it, (it) was called/cried, from the valley`s the right side/shore/bank, in the spot/place the blessed from the tree, that: "You Moses that I am God, Lord (of) the creations all together/(universes)
And that (E) throw/throw away your stick/cane. So when he saw it it shakes/moves as though it (is) a Jinn , he turned away giving his back, and he did not follow/track . "You Moses approach/come, and do not fear, that you are from the safe/secure
Enter/pass your hand in your collar/pocket , it emerges white from without evil/harm , and gather/join (fold) to you your wing/side from the terror/fright, so those two are two proofs/evidences from your Lord to Pharaoh, and his nobles/assembly , that they were a nation (of) debauchers
He said: "My Lord, that I, I killed a self from them so I fear that they kill me
And my brother Aaron, he is more pronouncing/eloquent (in) tongue/speech than me, so send him with me (as) support/help he confirms me , that I , I fear that they deny me
(He said): "We will strengthen/support your upper arm/assistance (give you confidence) with your brother, and We will make/put for you (B) power/control , so they do not reach to you (B), with Our verses/evidences/signs, you (B) and who followed you (B) (are) the defeators/conquerors
So when Moses came to them with Our evidences/signs evidences, they said: "What (is) that except magic/sorcery fabricated/cut and split, and We did not hear with that in our fathers/forefathers, the first/beginning
And Moses said: "My Lord (is) more knowledgeable with (about) who came with the guidance from at Him, and who the house`s/home`s end/turn (result) be for him; that He does not make the unjust/oppressive succeed/win
And Pharaoh said: "You, you the nobles/assembly, I did not know for you from a god other than me, so ignite/light/kindle for me you Haman on the mud/clay , so make/put for me a tall palace/tower maybe I look/see to Moses` God, and I, I think/suspect (E) him (he is) from the liars/falsifiers
And he became arrogant, he and his soldiers/warriors in the earth/Planet Earth without the right/truth ,and they thought/assumed that they are to Us not being returned
So We punished/took him and his soldiers/warriors , so We discarded them/threw them away in the body of water , so look/see/wonder about how was the unjust`s/oppressive`s end/turn (result)
And We made them leaders/examples calling to the fire , and (on) the Resurrection Day they not be given victory/aid
And We made them be followed in this the present world (by a) curse/torture, and (on) the Resurrection Day they are from the turned ugly/obscene
And We had given/brought to Moses The Book from after what We destroyed the generations the first/beginning, evidences/clear sightedness/instincts for the people and guidance and mercy, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember
And you were not at the western`s side/direction when We completed/informed to Moses the matter/affair/order/command, and you were not from the present
And but We created/originated generations/peoples of eras , so the lifetime lengthened on (to) them, and you were not residing/dwelling in Madya`s people, you read/recite on (to) them Our verses/evidences/signs, and but We, We were sending
And you were not at the mountain`s side/direction, when We called, and but mercy from your Lord, to warn/give notice (to) a nation, a warner/giver of notice did not come to them from before you, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember
Had it not been for that a disaster strikes them because (of) what their hands presented/undertook , so they said: "Our Lord, if only you sent on (to) us a messenger, so we follow your verses/evidences/signs, and we be from the believers
So when the truth came to them from at Us, they said: "If only (he) was given/brought to equal/similar (to) what was given/brought (to) Moses." Did they not disbelieve with what was given/brought (to) Moses from before? They said: "Two magicians/sorcerers, they (B) cooperated (with)/backed each other." And they said: "That we are with all/each disbelieving
Say: "So come with a Book from at God, He/it is more guided/guiding than them (B), I follow it if you were truthful
So if they did not answer/reply to you, so know that they follow their self attractions for desires , and who (is) more misguided than who followed his self attractions for desires without guidance from God? That (E) God does not guide the nation, the unjust/oppressive
And We had reached/connected for them the words/opinion and belief maybe/perhaps they remember/mention
Those who We gave/brought them The Book from before it/Him, they are with it/Him believing
And if (it) is read/recited on (to) them, they said: "We believed with it, that it truly is the truth from our Lord, that we were from before it Moslems/submitters
Those, they, they are given their reward twice because (of) what they were patient, and they drive away/repel the sins/crimes with the good/goodness, and from what We provided for them they spend
And if they heard/listened (to) the nonsense/senseless talk , they turned away from it, and they said: "For us (are) our deeds, and for you, your deeds, a greeting/peace on (to) you, we do not wish/desire the lowly/ignorant
That you do not guide whom you loved/liked, and but God guides whom He wills/wants, and He is more knowledgeable with (about) the guided
And they said: "If (E) we follow the guidance with you we be snatched from our land ." Did We not strengthen/secure for them forbidden/sacred safe/secure fruits (of) every thing is being gathered to it, provision from at Us, and but most of them do not know
And how many We perished/destroyed from a village/urban city its life/livelihood/sustenance became unappreciated/undeserved (they were ungrateful for their livelihood), so those are their residences, did not get inhabited from after them, except a few/little , and We were, We, the heirs/inheritants
And your Lord was not perishing/destroying the villages/urban cities, until He sends in its origin a messenger, he reads/recites on (to) them Our verses/evidences/signs, and We were not destroying the villages/urban cities, except and (while) its people (are) unjust/oppressive
And you were not given from a thing so enjoyment (of) the life the present/worldly life, and its decoration/beauty/ornament, and what (is) at God (is) best and more lasting/continuing (everlasting), so do you not reason/comprehend
Is who We promised him a good/beautiful promise, so he is receiving/finding it (E) , as who We made him enjoy the life the present`s/worldly life`s enjoyment then he is (on) the Resurrection Day from present/attending
And a day/time He calls them, so He says: "Where (are) My partners those whom you were claiming/alleging
Those who the saying/opinion and belief became deserved on (to) them said: "Our Lord, those (are) those who we misguided , we misguided them as/like we were misguided we declared innocence to You, they were not (to) us worshipping
And (it) was said: "Call your partners." so they called them, so they did not answer/reply to them, and they saw/understood the torture. If only that they were being guided
And a day/time He calls them, so He says: "What (did) you reply/answer the messengers
So the information/news was blinding/confusing on (to) them (on) that day, so they do not ask/question each other
So but who repented, and believed, and made/did correct/righteous deeds, so maybe/perhaps that (he) be from the successful/winners
And your Lord creates what He wills/wants, and He chooses; the best choice/best is/was not for them, God`s praise/glory and high, mighty, exalted and dignified from/about what they share/make partners (with Him)
And your Lord knows what their chests (innermosts) conceal/cover , and what they declare/publicize
And He is God, (there is) no God except Him, for Him (is) the praise/gratitude in the first/beginning and the end (other life), and for Him (is) the judgment/rule, and to Him, you are being returned
Say: "Did you see/understand if God made/put on you the night continuous to the Resurrection Day? Which god other than God, brings you with a light/illumination , so do you not hear/listen
Say: "Did you see/understand if God made/put on you the daytime continuous to the Resurrection Day? Which god other than God, brings you with night to be tranquil/settling in it, so do you not see/look/understand
And from His mercy, He made/put for you the night and the daytime, to be tranquil/settled in it, and to wish/desire from His grace/favour/blessing, and maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful
And a day/time He calls them, so he says: "Where (are) my partners (with Me) those whom you were claiming/alleging
And We removed/pulled away from every nation/generation/century, a witness/testifier , so We said: "Bring/give your proof/evidence." So they knew that the truth (is) to God, and what they were making/fabricating , (was) wasted/lost from them
That (E) Qaroon/Korah was from Moses` nation, so he oppressed/transgressed on them, and We gave/brought him from the treasures what that (E) its keys (is a) burdensome weight (E) with (for) the group/band/company of strength/power , when his nation said to him: "Do not rejoice/delight , that (E) God does not love/like the rejoiced/delighted
And wish/desire in what God gave you, the home/house (of) the end (other life), and do not forget your share/fortune in the present world, and do good deeds (give charity) as/like God did good to you, and do not wish/desire the corruption in the land/Planet Earth, that (E) God does not love/like the corrupting/disordering
He said: "But/truly I got it on knowledge at me." Did he not know that God had perished/destroyed from before him from the generations/peoples of eras who he is stronger than him power/strength and more gathering/assembling? And the criminals/sinners do not be asked/questioned about their crimes
So he got out/emerged on (to) his nation in his decoration/beauty/ornament, those who want the life the present/worldly life said: "Oh, if only for us similar/equal (to) what Qaroon/Korah was given/brought to, that he truly is of great luck/fortune
And those who were given the knowledge said: "Your calamity , God`s reward/compensation (is) best to who believed, and made/did correct/righteous deeds, and none receives/meets/finds it except the patient
So We sunk down the Earth/land with him and with his home/house. So (there) was not for him from a group (to) give him victory/aid from other than God, and (he) was not from the victorious
And those who wished/desired his place/position at the yesterday/past became/became in the morning saying: "Woe as if/as though God spreads/extends the provision to whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves , and He is capable/able , if only that God blessed on us He would have sunk down (the land) with us, woe, as if he/as though He does not make the disbelievers succeed/win
That is the house/home of the end (other life), We make/create it to those who do not want height, might and dignity in the earth/Planet Earth, and nor a corruption , and the end (result) is to the fearing and obeying
Who came with the good/goodness, so to him better than it, and who came with the sin/crime, so those who made/did the sins/crimes will not be reimbursed except (for) what they were making/doing
That (E) who specified/imposed/stipulated on you the Koran, (is) returning you (E) to a return/paradise/final place , say: "My Lord (is) more knowledgeable (of) who came with the guidance, and who he is in (a) clear/evident misguidance
And you were not hoping/expecting that (E) The Book be thrown to you, except mercy from your Lord, so do not be (E) supporting/helping to the disbelievers
And let (them) not obstruct/prevent you from God`s verses/evidences after when (it) was descended to you, and call to your Lord, and do not be from the sharers/takers of partners (with God)
And do not call with God another god, (there is) no god except Him, every thing (is) perishing/destroying ,except His face/front , for Him (is) the judgment/rule, and to Him you are being returned
A L M
Did the people think/suppose that they be left that they say: "We believed." And they are not being tested
And We had tested those who (were) from before them, so God knows (E) those who were truthful, and He knows (E) the liars/deniers/falsifiers
Or those who make/do the sins/crimes thought/supposed that they precede/surpass Us , it became bad/evil/harmful what they judge/rule
Who was/is hoping/expecting God`s meeting, so that God`s term/time is coming (E), and He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable
And who struggled/exerted , so but he struggles/exerts for his self, that God (is) rich (E) from (not in need to) the creations all together/(universes)

And We directed/recommended the human (with) a goodness/beauty with (to) his parents, and if they (B) did their utmost against you to share/make partners with Me, for what is not for you knowledge with it, so do not obey them (B), to Me (is) your return, so I inform you with what you were making/doing
And those who believed, and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, We will enter them (E) in (with) the correct/righteous
And from the people who says: "We believed by God." So if he was harmed mildly in God, he made/put the people`s test/torture as/like God`s torture, and if victory/aid came from your Lord, they will say (E): "That we were with you." Or is not God with more knowledgeable with what (is in) the creation`s all together`s/(universes) chests (innermosts)
And God knows (E) those who believed, and He knows (E) the hypocrites
And those who disbelieved said to those who believed: "Follow our way/method , and we bear/carry (E) your sins/mistakes ." And they are not with carrying from their sins/mistakes from a thing, that they truly are lying/denying/falsifying (E)

And Abraham when he said to his nation: "Worship God, and fear and obey Him, that (is) best for you, if you were knowing
But/truly you worship from other than God (except) idolized statues/idols, and you create lies/falsehood, that those who you worship from other than God do not own/possess for you a provision , so wish/desire at God the provision , and worship Him, and thank/be grateful to Him, to Him you are being returned
And if you lie/deny/falsify, so nations from before you had lied/denied/falsified, and nothing (is) on the messenger except the information/communication, the clear/evident
Did they not see/understand how God begins/initiates the creation then He returns/repeats it? That (E) that (is) on God easy/little
Say: "Walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth, so see/wonder about how He began/initiated the creation, then God creates/originates the creation/origination the end/last, that (E) God (is) on every thing capable/able
He tortures whom He wills/wants, and He has mercy (upon) whom He wills/wants, and to Him you are being turned/returned

And those who disbelieved with God`s verses/evidences/signs, and meeting Him, those, they despaired/became hopeless from My mercy, and those for them (is) a painful torture
So his nation`s answer/reply was not except that they said: "Kill him, or burn him." so God saved/rescued him from the fire, that in that (are) evidences/signs/verses (E), to a nation believing
And he said: "But/truly you took/received from other than God idols/idolized statues, love/affection/friendship between you in the life the present/worldly life, then (on) the Resurrection Day some of you disbelieves with some, and some of you curses/humiliates some, and your shelter/refuge (is) the fire, and (there are) none from victoriors/saviors for you

So his nation`s answer/reply was not except that they said: "Come/bring to us with God`s torture, if you were from the truthful
He said: "My Lord give me victory/aid over the nation the corrupting
And when Our messengers, came (to) Abraham with the good news, they said: "We are (E), we are perishing/destroying , this the village`s/urban cities` people , that (E) its people were unjust/oppressive
He said: "That (E) in it (is) Lot." They said: "We are more knowledgeable with who (is) in it, we will save/rescue him (E) and his family/people except his woman (wife) was from the remaining behind
And when that Our messengers came (to) Lot he felt bad/evil/harm with them, and he was impatient with them/unable to do or accomplish what ought to be done (became troubled), and they said: "Do not fear, and nor be sad/grievous, that we are saving/rescuing you and your family/people except your woman (wife) was from the remaining behind
We (E), we are descending on, this the village`s/urban cities` people , filth/torture from the sky/space because (of) what they were debauching
And We had left from it an evident sign/evidence to a nation reasoning/understanding
And to Madya their brother Shu`aib , so he said: "My nation worship God, and hope/expect the Day the Last/Resurrection Day, and do not corrupt in the earth/Planet Earth corrupting
So they denied him so the tremble and shake/quake/agitation punished/took them, so they became/became in the morning in their home/country/tribe stuck to the ground dead
And Aad , and Thamud , and had been clarified/shown/explained to you from their residences, and the devil decorated/beautified for them their deeds , so he prevented/obstructed them from the road/path and they were seeing/knowing/understanding
And Qaroon/Korah , and Pharaoh and Haman , and had come to them Moses with the evidences, so they became arrogant in the earth/Planet Earth, and they were not racing/surpassing/preceding
So each/all We took/punished with his crime so from them, whom We sent on (to) him a violent wind carrying pebbles and hail/hail laden clouds, and from them whom the loud strong cry/torture raid punished/took him, and from them whom We sunk down/caved in with him the earth/Planet Earth, and from them whom We drowned/sunk, and God was not to cause injustice/oppress them, and but they were themselves causing injustice/oppression
(The) example proverb (of) those who took from other than God guardians/allies , (is) as the example/proverb (of) the spider, it took/received (F) a house/home, and that (the) weakest/most feeble (of) the houses/homes, (is the) house/home (E) (of) the spider, if they were knowing

God created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth , that in that (is) a sign/evidence (E) to the believers
Read/recite/follow what was inspired/transmitted to you from The Book , and start/keep up the prayers, that (E) the prayers forbid/prevent from the enormous/atrocious deeds and the defiance of God and His orders/obscenity , and God`s remembrance/reminder (E) (is) greater , and God knows what you perform/produce
And do not argue/dispute with The Book`s people except with which it is best , except those who were unjust/oppressive from them, and say: "We believed with what was descended on (to) us, and was descended to you, and our God, and your God (is) one, and we are to Him Moslems/submitters
And like that, We descended to you The Book , so those who We gave/brought them The Book , they believe by (in) it, and from those who believes by (in) it, and none disbelieves and denies with Our verses/evidences except the disbelievers
And We were not reading/reciting from before it from a Book , and nor you write it with your right (hand), then the wasters/falsifiers would have doubted/become suspicious
But it is verses/evidences evidences in those who were given/brought the knowledge`s chests (innermosts), and none disbelieves and denies with Our verses/evidences except the unjust/oppressive
And they said: "If only verses/evidences/signs were descended on (to) him from his Lord." Say: "But/truly the verses/evidence/signs (are) at God, and but/truly I am a clear/evident warner/giver of notice
Was (it) not enough/sufficient for them that We descended on (to) you The Book (it) is being read/recited on (to) them, that in that (is) mercy (E) and a remembrance/reminder to a nation believing
Say: "Enough/sufficient by God between me and between you (as) a witness/testifier , He knows what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and those who believed by (in) the falsehood, and disbelieved by (in) God, those, they are the losers
And they hasten/urge you with the torture, and where it not for a named/identified (specified) term/time, the torture would have come to them, and it will come to them (E) suddenly/unexpectedly, and (while) they do not feel/sense/know
They hasten/urge you with the torture, and that truly Hell is surrounding/enveloping (E) with the disbelievers
A day/time the torture covers/afflicts them from above them, and from below/beneath their feet, and He/it says: "Taste/experience what you were making/doing
You, My worshippers/slaves those who believed, that truly My ground/land/Earth (is) spread/spacious , so (only) Me, so worship Me
Each/every self (is) tasting/experiencing the death, then to Us you are being returned
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, We (will) reside/assign them (E) from the Paradise/treed garden chambers/elevated (stages/places), the rivers/waterways run/flow from below/beneath it, immorally/eternally in it, blessed/praised (is) the makers`/doers` reward/fee
Those who were patient, and on their Lord they rely/trust in
And how many from a walker/creeper/crawler (that) does not bear/carry its provision? God provides for it and you. And He is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable

He is who made/put you (as) caliphs/successors and replacers in the earth/Planet Earth, so who disbelieved so on him (is) his disbelief, and the disbeliever`s disbelief does not increase (them) at their Lord except abhorrence/hatred , the disbeliever`s disbelief does not increase (them) except loss/misguidance and perishment
Say: "Did you see/understand your partners (with God) those whom you call from other than God? Show me/make me understand what they created from the earth/Planet Earth, or for them (is) a share/partnership in the skies/space, or We gave/brought them a Book so they are on an evidence from it? But that truly the unjust/oppressive promise some of them (to) some (each other) except deceit/temptation
That truly God holds/grasps/seizes the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth that (E) they (B) vanish/cease to exist , and if (E) they (B) vanished/ceased to exist , that truly/if (some one) grasped/seized them (B) from anyone from after Him, that He truly was/is clement , forgiving (God is the only one that holds the skies and earth in place, and when they do vanish at the resurrection, no one will hold them in place)
And they swore/made oath by God their rights`/oath`s utmost if (E) a warner/giver of notice came to them they will be/become more guided than any (of) the nations , so when a warner/giver of notice came to them, did not (nothing) increased them except hastening away with aversion
Arrogance in the earth/Planet Earth, and the bad`s/evil`s/harm`s deceit/scheme , does not surround/ afflict except with its people , so do they wait (for) the first`s/beginner`s manner/law ? So you will never/not find for God`s law/manner (an) exchange/replacement , and you will never/not find for God`s law/manner a change/movement
Do they not walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth so they see/think about how was (the) end/turn (result of) those from before them? And they were stronger than them (in) strength/power , and nothing from a thing was to disable/frustrate Him, God, in the skies/space and nor in the earth/Planet Earth, that He truly was/is knowledgeable, capable/able
And if God punishes/takes the people because (of) what they earned/acquired/won , He would not have left on its back/surface/top from a walker/creeper/crawler , and but He delays them to a named/identified term/time, so if their term/time came, so then God was/is with His worshippers/slaves seeing/knowing/understanding
Y S
And the Koran , the wise/judicious
That you are from (E) the messengers
On a straight/direct/balanced road/way
Descent (from) the glorious/mighty, the merciful
To warn/give notice (E) (to) a nation, their fathers were not warned/given notice, so they are ignoring/neglecting/disregarding
The saying/word had been (E) true/deserved on most of them, so they do not believe
We (E) put/made in their necks leather/iron collars or handcuffs, so it is to the chins/beards, so they are being forced to raise their heads while lowering their eyes from humility
And We put/made from between their hands a barrier , and from behind them a barrier , so We covered/afflicted them , so they do not see/look/understand
And (it is) equal/alike on (to) them had you warned/given them notice, or you did not warn/give them notice, they do not believe
But/truly you warn/give notice (to) whom followed the reminder/remembrance and feared the merciful with the unseen/hidden , so announce good news to him with forgiveness, and (an) honored/generous reward
We (E), We, We revive/make alive the deads and We write/dictate what they advanced/introduced , and their tracks/marks/signs, and every thing We counted/controlled/calculated it in a clear/evident example (model/guide)
And give for them an example/proverb (of) the village`s/urban city`s owners/company , when the messengers came to them
When We sent to them two, so they denied/falsified them (B) , so We strengthened/ supported with a third, so they said: "We (E) (are) sent/being sent to you
They said: "You are not except humans equal/alike to us , and the merciful did not descend from a thing, that truly you are except lying/denying/falsifying
They said: "Our Lord knows, that we are to you sent/messengers (E)
And nothing (is) on us except the information/communication, the clear/evident
They said: "That we, we had a bad omen with you (you are a bad omen to us) if (E) you did not end/terminate/stop we will stone you (E), and a painful torture from us will touch you (E)
They said: "Your omen (fate/future is) with you, (even if you) are, you were reminded, but you are a nation (of) wasters/extravagators
And from (the) farthest of the city/town came a man walking quickly he said: "You my nation, follow the messengers
Follow who does not ask/question you (for) a reward/wage/fee, and they are guided
And why for me (that) I not worship who created me/brought me into being , and to him you are being returned
Do I take from other than Him gods, if the merciful wants/intends me with harm, (so) their mediation does not enrich/suffice me from me a thing, and they do not rescue/save me
That I am then in (E) clear/evident misguidance
That I believed with (in) your Lord, so hear/listen to me
(It) was/is said: "Enter the Paradise." He said: "Oh if only my nation know
With what my Lord forgave for me, and He made/put me from the honoured
And We did not descend on his nation from after him from soldiers/warriors from the sky/space, and We were not sent descending
That (E) (it) was except one loud strong cry/torture raid so then they are still/silent/dead
Oh grief/sorrow on the slaves/servants , none from a messenger comes to them, except (that) they were with him mocking/making fun
Do they not see/understand how many We destroyed before them from the generations/peoples of eras/centuries, that they, to them they do not return
And that (E) each/all (E) all/all together (are) at/by Us, they are made to be present/made to attend
And an evidence/sign for them (is) the land/Earth the dead, We revived it, and We brought out from it seeds/grains, so from it they eat
And We made/put in it treed gardens from palm trees and grapes, and We caused to flow/burst in it from the water springs/water wells
To eat from its fruit, and what their hands made/did/worked it, so do they not thank/be grateful
Praise/glory (to) who created the pairs/kinds all of it, from what the land/Earth prouts/grows, and from themselves and from what they do not know
And an evidence/sign for them (is) the night, We skin off/uncover from it the daytime, so then they are darkened/in darkness
And the sun passes/orbits to an establishment/affixation to it, that (is) the glorious`/mighty`s predestination/evaluation
And the moon We predestined/evaluated it (in) sequences/descents until it returned as/like the palm tree`s branch/date bunch, the old
The sun should not (be) to it that it catches up/overtakes/reaches the moon, and nor the night (is) surpassing/preceding the daytime, and each (is) in (an) orbit/circuit floating
And an evidence/sign for them (is) that We, We carried/loaded their descendants in the ship/ships, the full/loaded
And We created for them from similar/equal/alike to it, what they ride/board
And if We will/want We drown/sink them, so (there be) no cries for help/aiders for them, and nor they be rescued/saved
Except mercy from Us, and a long life/enjoyment to a time
And if (it) was said to them: "Fear and obey what (is) between your hands and what (is) behind you, maybe/perhaps you attain mercy
And none from an evidence/sign/verse from their Lord`s evidences/signs/verses comes to them except they were from it objecting/opposing/turning away
And if (it) was said to them: "Spend from what God provided for you." Those who disbelieved said to those who believed: "Do we feed whom if God wanted/willed He fed him? That truly you are in except clear/evident misguidance
And they say: "When (is) that the promise, if you were truthful
They do not wait except (for) one loud strong cry/torture raid (that) punishes/punishes them, and (while) they are disputing/controverting with each other
So they are not being able (of) direction/influence , and nor to their families they return
And (it) was blown in the horn/bugle so then they are from the graves to their Lord they drop/rush down
They said: "Oh our calamity/scandal who sent/woke us up from our place of sleep? That (is) what the merciful promised and the messengers were truthful
That truly (it) was except one loud strong cry/torture raid, so then they are all/all together at Us, they are made to be present/made to attend
So the day/today no self be caused injustice to/be oppressed a thing, and you are not being reimbursed except (for) what you were making/doing
That the Paradises` friends/company the day/today (are) in work/occupation/function enjoying/joyful/humorous
They and their spouses (are) in shades on the luxurious beds/couches leaning on/reclining on
For them in it (are) fruits, and for them what they call/wish/desire
A greeting/safety/security , a word/saying from a merciful Lord
And be distinguished/separated the day/today, oh you, the criminals/sinners
Did I not entrust/make a contract to you, Adam`s sons and daughters, that do not worship the devil ,that he truly is for you a clear/evident enemy
And that (E) worship Me, that (is) a straight/direct road/way
And he (the devil) had (E) misguided many nations/creations from you, were you not being understanding/comprehending
This (is) Hell which you were being promised
The day/today roast/suffer/burn (from) it because (of) what you were disbelieving
The day/today We seal off/stamp on their mouths, and their hands converse/speak to Us , and their feet witness/testify with what they were earning/acquiring
And if We will/want We would have wiped out/destroyed on their eyes/sights, so they raced/surpassed/preceded the road/way, so how (do) they see/understand
And if We will/want We would have transformed them to worse shape/metamorphosed them on their capacity/place/position, so they were not able (of) passing/preceding/completing , and nor they return
And whom We grant him long life We reverse him (make him senile) in the creation, do they not reason/understand
And We did not teach/instruct him the poetry, and (it) should not (be) for him that it is except (a) reminder and (a) clear/evident Koran
To warn/give notice to who was/is alive and the opinion and belief/saying/word becomes deserved/truth on the disbelievers
Did they not see/understand that We created for them from what Our hands made/did camels/livestock, so they are for it owning/possessing
And We manipulated/eased it for them, so from it (is) their riding , and from it they eat
And for them in it (are) benefits/uses and drinking places, so do they not thank/be grateful
And they took from other than God, gods, maybe/perhaps they be given victory/aid
They are not being able (of) giving them victory/aiding them, and they are for them soldiers/warriors being made to be present/attend
So let not their word/opinion and belief to sadden/make you grievous, that We know what they keep secret and what they declare/publicize
Does not the human/mankind see/understand that We created him from a drop/male`s or female`s secretion , so then he is a clear/evident disputer/adversary/arguer
And he gave to us an example/proverb, and he forgot his creation, he said: "Who revives/makes alive the bones and (while) it is decayed/decomposed
Say: "Revives/makes it alive (God) who created/originated it (the) first/beginning time, and He is with every/each creation knowledgeable
Who created/made/put for you from the trees the green a fire, so then you are from it igniting/kindling
Or is not who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, with capable on that He creates equal/alike to them . Yes/certainly and He is the creator, the knowledgeable
But/truly His order/command if He wanted/willed a thing, (is) that He says to it: "Be." so it becomes
So praise/glory (to) who with His hands (are) every thing`s ownership/might and power , and to Him you are being returned
And the expanded and motionless wings in a row, arranged
So the preventing/deterring , preventing/deterring/ousting
So the reading/reciting/following, mentioning/remembering
That truly your Lord (is) one (E)
Lord (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B), and Lord (of) the sun rises/easts
That We decorated/beautified the sky/space (of) the present world with the stars`/planets` decoration/beauty
And a protection/guarding from every/each rebellious/mutinous devil
They do not hear/listen (E) to the nobles/assembly the highest/mightiest/most dignified, and they be thrown/hurled from every/each side/direction
Expelled/driven away , and for them (is) a permanent/continuous/lasting torture
Except who snatched the one snatch, so a light from a fire source/a star lit/ignited/penetrating followed him
So ask/take their opinion , are they a stronger creation, or who We created? That We created them from very sticky mud/clay
But you wondered/were astonished/were surprised, and they humiliate/mock/undermine/ridicule
And if they were reminded, they do not mention/remember
And if they saw/understood an evidence/sign/verse, they humiliate/mock/ridicule/undermine
And they said: "That truly this (is) except clear/evident magic/sorcery
Is (it that) if we died and we were dust and bones, are we being resurrected/revived (E)
Or our fathers the first/beginners
Say: "Yes, and you are degraded/lowly
So but it is a one cry to drive out , so then they are looking/seeing
And they said: "Oh our calamity/scandal that, it is the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day
That (is) the Judgment Day/Separation Day/Resurrection Day which you were with it lying/denying/falsifying
Gather those who were unjust/oppressive and their spouses , and what they were worshipping
From other than God, so guide them to the Hell`s road/way
And stop/suspend them , that they are questioned
And what (is it) for you, you do not give victory/aid
But they are the day/today submitting/surrendering
And some of them approached/came on (to) some, they ask/question each other
They said: "That you were coming to us from the right (side)
They said: "But you were not being believing
And (there) was not from power/control for us over you, but you were a tyrannizing/arrogant nation
So became deserved on us our Lord`s word/saying , that we (are) tasting/experiencing
So we misguided/lured you , that we were misguiding
So then they are (on) that day in the torture sharing
We, like that, We make/do with the criminals/sinners
That they truly were if (it) was said to them: "No God except god" they be arrogant
And they say: "Are we to leave our gods to a mad/insane poet
But He came with the truth and he confirmed the messengers
That you are tasting/experiencing the torture, the painful
And you are not being reimbursed except (for) what you were making/doing/working
Except God`s worshippers/slaves , the faithful/loyal
Those, for them (is) a known provision
Fruits, and they are honoured
In the blessed/comfort and ease treed gardens/paradises
On beds/sofas facing each other
Being circled/walked around on them with a cup/container to drink from/wine from goodness
White (a) delight/pleasure to the drinking
Destruction/intoxication (is) not in it, nor they be drunk/made to loose their minds/drained/exhausted from it
And at them the eye`s/eyelid`s confining/limiting/restricting big beautiful eyes
As though they are (F) protected/covered whites/eggs
So some of them approached/came on (to) some, they ask/question each other
A speaker from them said: "That I, (there) was for me (a) companion
He says: "You are (E) from the confirming/charity givers
Is (it that) if we died, and we were dust and bones are we indebted (E)
He said: "Are you knowing/seeing/looking
So he looked/saw, so he saw him in the Hell`s middle
He said: "By God if you were about to to make me fall/ruin (E)
And where it not for my Lord`s blessing/goodness I would have been from the made present/attending
So are we not with dying
Except our death/lifelessness the first/beginning, and we are not with being tortured
That this it is (E) the winning/success the great
Similar/equal/alike to this, so the makers/doers/workers, should make/do/work
Is that a better place of descent or the deadly food`s tree
That We made/put it (as) a test/charm to the unjust/oppressive
That it is a tree it emerges in the Hell`s source/root
Its first fruit of the season as though it (is) the devils` heads/tops
So then they are eating exaggerated/gluttons from it, so they are filling from it the bellies/insides
Then for them on it (is) a mixture/heat (E) from hot/cold water/red hot coal
Then that their return (is) to (E) the Hell
That they truly found their fathers misguided
So they are on their tracks/marks/signs rushing disturbedly
And most of the first/beginners had been (E) misguided before them
And We had (E) sent in (between) them warners/givers of notice
So look/see/wonder about how was the warned`s/given notice`s end/turn (result)
Except God`s worshippers/slaves , the faithful/loyal/devoted
And Noah had called/cried (to) Us, so blessed/praised (E) (are) the answerers/repliers
And We saved/rescued him and his family/relation from the grief, hardship and suffering the great
And We made/put his descendants, they are the remaining
And We left on him in the lasts
Peace/security on Noah in the creations are together/(universes)
We (E) like that, We reimburse the good doers
That he truly is from Our worshippers/slaves , the believers
Then We drowned/sunk the others/lasts
And that truly from his group/party/follower (was) Abraham (E)
When he came (to) his Lord with a sound/safe heart/mind
When he said to his father and nation: "What (do) you worship
Are falsified gods from other than God (what) you want/intend
So what (is) your thought/assumption with (about) the creations all together`s/ (universes`) Lord
So he looked/saw a glance/consideration in the stars/planets
So he said: "That I am sick/ill
So they turned away from him giving their backs
So he conned his way to their gods, so he said: "Do you not eat
Why for you, you do not speak
So he conned his way on them moving/striking with the right (hand)
So they (his nation) approached/came to him hurrying/hastening
He said: "Do you worship what you carve out/cut
And God created you and what you make/do
They said: "Build/construct for him a building/structure, so throw him away in the place of intense heat/roaring fire
So they intended/wanted a conspiracy/harm with (for) him, so We made/put them the lowest/meanest
And he said: "That I am going/going away to my Lord, he will guide me
My Lord grant/present (for) me from the correct/righteous
So We announced good news to him with a clement boy
So when he reached the struggle/endeavor with him, he said you my son: "That I, I see/understand in the sleep/dream that I, I slaughter you/cut your throat, so look/wonder about/consider what you see/understand." He said: "You my father, make/do what you are being ordered/commanded, so you will find me, if God wills/wants from the patient
So when they (B) submitted/surrounded and he pulled/pushed/followed him to the foreheads
And We called him: "That you Abraham
You had confirmed the dream, We (E), like that We reimburse the good doers
That truly that it is (E) the test, the clear/evident
And We substituted him with a great slaughtered (animal)
And We left on him in the others/lasts
Safety/security/greeting on Abraham
As/like that We reimburse the good doers
That he truly is from Our worshippers/slaves the believers
And We announced good news to him (of) Isaac a prophet from the correct/righteous
And We blessed on him and on Isaac, and from their (B)`s descendants, (are) good doers, and (a) clear/evident unjust/oppressive to himself
And We had blessed on Moses and Aaron
And We saved/rescued them (B) and their (B)`s nation from the grief/hardship and suffering, the great
And We gave them victory, so they were, they, the defeators/conquerors
And We gave/brought them (B) The Book , the clear/evident
And We guided them (B) the road/way, the straight/direct
And We left on them (B) in the others/lasts
Safety/security/greeting on Moses and Aaron
We (E), like that We reimburse the good doers
That they truly are from Our worshippers/slaves the believers
And that Elias (is) from (E) the messengers
When he said to his nation: "Do you not fear and obey
Do you call an idol statue/master , and you leave the creator`s best
God (is) your Lord, and your fathers`/forefathers` lord the first/beginners
So they lied/denied/falsified him, so they truly are being made to be present/attend (E)
Except God`s worshippers/slaves , the faithful/loyal/devoted
And We left on him in the others/lasts
Safety/security/greeting on Elias
We, like that We reimburse the good doers
That he truly (is) from Our worshippers/slaves the believers
And that truly Lot (was) from (E) the messengers
When We saved/rescued him and his family/people all/all together
Except old/weak (his wife was) in the remaining behind

And at the night, so do you not reason/understand/comprehend

When he escaped/took shelter to the ship/ships, the full/loaded
So he drew lots with (gambled) , so he was from the annulled/slipped

So had it not been for that he (was) from the praising/glorifying
He would have stayed/remained in its belly/inside to a day/time they be sent/resurrected/revived
So We casted him off/discarded him at the open space and (while) he is sick/ill
And We sprouted/grew on him a tree from a plant without a stem/squashes and cucumbers
And We sent him to one hundred thousand or they increase/exceed
So they believed, so We gave them long life/made them enjoy to a time/period of time
So ask/take their opinion is to your Lord the daughters, and for them (are) the sons
Or We created the angels (as) females and they are witnessing/testifying
Is (it) not that they truly are from their lies/falsehood, they say (E)
God gave birth . And that they truly are lying/denying/falsifying (E)
He chose/purified the daughters on/over the sons
What (is) for you how you judge/rule
Do you not mention/remember
Or for you (is) a clear/evident proof/evidence
So come/bring with your Book if you were truthful
And they made/put between Him and between the Jinns (a) relationship/kinship and the Jinns had (E) known that they truly are being made to be present/attend (E)
God`s praise/glory from/about what they describe/categorize
Except God`s worshippers/slaves, the faithful/loyal/devoted
So you truly are, and what you worship
You are not on Him/it with charming/misguiding
Except whom he is entering into fire/roasting the Hell
(The angels say): "And none for Us except for him (is) a known place and time/position/status
And that We, We are (E) the liners/arrangers
And that We, We are (E) the praising/glorifying
And if they (the disbelievers) were saying (E)
If that (E) at us (is) a reminder/remembrance from the first/beginners
We would have been God`s worshippers/slaves , the faithful/loyal/devoted
So they disbelieved with (in) Him, so they will know
And Our words/expressions/speech had (E) preceded to Our worshippers/slaves the messengers
That they truly, they are (E) the victorious
And that (E) Our soldiers/warriors , they are (E) the defeators/conquerors
So turn away from them until a time/period of time
And make them see/understand, so they will/shall see/look/understand
Are they with Our torture urging/hastening
So if it (the torture) descended at their court/yard, so it became (a) bad/evil/harmful morning/day break (of) the warned/given notice
And turn away from them until a time/period of time
And see/understand , so they will see/understand

And a safety/security/greeting on the messengers
And the praise/gratitude (is) to God, the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
S/C/SAD and the Koran (owner) of the reminder/remembrance
But those who disbelieved (are) in glory/might/power and defiance/animosity
How many from (a) people of one era/generation We destroyed from before them? So they called: "And it is not the time, time for escape (expression)
And they were wondering/astonished/surprised that (a) warner/giver of notice came to them from them, and the disbelievers said: "That (is a) liar/denier/falsifier, (a) magician/sorcerer
Did he make the gods one god? That (E) that (is an) astounding/surprising thing (E)
And the assembly/nobles set out that: "Walk and be patient on your gods, that (E) (is) a thing (E) is being wanted/intended
We did not hear/listen with that in the religion/faith the last, that (E) that is except creations/inventions
Is the reminder/remembrance descended on (to) him from between us? But they are in doubt/suspicion from My remembrance/reminder, but till now they did not taste/experience My torture
Or at them (is) your Lord`s safes/storages (of) mercy, the glorious/mighty the grantor/presenter
Or for them (is) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s and what (is) between them (B)`s ownership/kingdom ? So they should ascend/climb in the reasons/connections
Soldiers/warriors from the groups/parties at that place and time (are) defeated
Noah`s, and Aad`s, and Pharaoh`s nation, (owner) of the stakes/pegs/nails denied/falsified before them
And Thamud and Lot`s nation, and owners/company (of) the thicket/dense tangled trees, those are the groups/parties
That (E) each/all except they did (without exception) lied/denied/falsified the messengers, so (they) deserved My punishment
And those do not look/see/watch except (for) one loud strong cry/torture raid, (there is) nothing from (a) recovery/awakening for it
And they said: "Our Lord hurry/hasten/speed for us our share/prize voucher/accounting book before the Account Day/Resurrection Day
Be patient on what they say, and mention/remember Our worshipper/slave David, (owner) of the power/strength/force, that he truly is repentant/returning
That We, We manipulated/subjugated the mountains with him, they praise/glorify at the evening/first darkness and the sun rise
And the birds gathered, each/all for him (are) returning
And We strengthened/supported his ownership/kingdom, and We gave/brought him the wisdom and judgment/decision (of) the speech/address/conversation
Did information/news (of) the disputers/adversaries/arguers come to you, when they climbed/scaled the center of the house/center of the assembly
When they entered on (to) David, so He was frightened/terrified from them, they said: "Do not fear (we are) two disputers/adversaries/arguers, some of us oppressed/transgressed on some (over each other), so judge/rule between us with the truth/just , and do not be unjust , and guide us to the road`s/way`s middle/straightness
That, this (is) my brother for him (are) nine and ninety ewes/female sheep, and for me (is) one ewe/female sheep. So he said: `Let me sponsor/maintain it.` And he overwhelmed me in the speech/conversation
He (David) said: "He had (E) caused injustice to you/oppressed you with requesting your ewe/female sheep to his ewes/female sheep, and that many from the associates/company some of them oppress/transgress (E) on some (each other) except those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and little/few what they are." And David doubted/suspected that We tested him so he asked for forgiveness (from) his Lord, and he fell down bowing, and He repented/obeyed
So We forgave for him that, and that for him at Us (is) an advancement/rank/degree (E) and (a) good/beautiful return
You David, that We made/put you (as) a caliph/leader in the land/Earth , so judge/rule between the people with the truth/just , and do not follow the self attraction for desire , so it misguides you from God`s way/path , that those who misguide from God`s way/path, for them (is) a strong (severe) torture because (of) what they forgot the Account Day/Resurrection Day
And We did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) wastefully/falsely , that is those who disbelieved`s doubt/suspicion, so calamity/scandal to those who disbelieved from the fire
Or We make/put those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds as/like the corrupting in the earth/Planet Earth, or We make/put the fearing and obeying as/like the debauchers/corrupters
A Book We descended it to you blessed, (so) they consider (E) its verses/ evidences and (to the owner`s) of the pure minds/hearts to mention/ remember

He said: "My Lord forgive for me, and grant/present for me an ownership/kingdom (that) should not be to anyone from after me, that You, You are the grantor/presenter
So We manipulated/subjugated for him the wind/breeze it flows/passes with his order/command, soft/gentle where/when it struck/marked
And the devils all/each (is a) builder/constructor and diver
And others tied to each other in the shackles/chairs
That (is) Our granting , so bless (do kind acts) and hold/seize without counting
And that (E) for him at Us (is) an approachment/degree/rank (E) and a good/beautiful return
And remember/mention Our worshipper/slave Job, when he called/cried (to) his Lord: "That I, the devil touched me with hardship/fatigue/disease and torture

Leaning/reclining in it, they call in it with much/many fruits, and a drink
And at them (are) the eyes`/eye lids` confining/limiting/restricting, same age/not aging
That (is) what you are being promised to the Account Day/Resurrection Day
That (E) this (is) Our provision (E), (there is) nothing from (a) depletion from it
This, and that truly to the tyrannizing/arrogant (is a) bad/evil (E) return
Hell they roast/suffer (from) it, so how bad (are) the beds (destination)
This, so they will taste/experience it hot/cold water , and cold/decayed/rotten
And other/another from its likeness/similarity spouses
This (is a) group/crowd bursting/plunging with you, (there is) no welcome with (for) them, that they are, they are entering/suffering the fire
They said: "But you are (there is) no welcome with (for) you, you advanced/introduced it for us." So how bad (is) the settlement/decision
They said: "Our Lord who advanced/introduced this for us, so increase him (with) a double torture in the fire
And they said: "Why (is it) for us, we do not see men, we were, we count them from the bad/evil/harmful
We took them (by) mocking/ridiculing or the eyesights/knowledge deviated/turned away from them
That truly that (is) true/fact (E) , the fire`s people dispute/ controvert/argue (among them selves)
Say: "Truly I am (a) warner/giver of notice, and (there is) none from a God, except God the one, the defeator/conqueror
The skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s Lord, and what (is) between them (B), the glorious/mighty ,the forgiving often/forgiver
Say: "Is it (a) great news/information
You are from it objecting/opposing
(There) was not from knowledge to me with the group/assembly/nobles, the highest/mightiest when they dispute/controvert/argue
That (it) is (only) inspired/transmitted to me except that I am a clear/evident warner/giver of notice
When your Lord said to the angels: "That I am creating a human from mud/clay
So if I straightened him, and I blew in him from My Soul/Spirit , so fall/come to him prostrating
So the angels prostrated all of them, all/all together
Except Satan he became arrogant, and was/is from the disbelievers
He said: "You Satan , what prevented/prohibited you that you prostrate to what I created with My hands, did you become arrogant, or you were from the high and mighty
He said: "I am better than him, You created me from fire and You created him from mud/clay
He said: "So get out/emerge from it, so that you are cursed/expelled

The Book`s descent from God, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious
That We, We descended to you The Book with the truth so worship God faithful, loyal/devoted to him (in) the religion
Is not to God the religion the clear/pure? And those who took from other than Him guardians/allies (they say): We do not worship them except to near/approach us to God, (an) approachment/ degree ." That truly God judges/rules between them in what they are in it differing/disputing , that truly God does not guide who he is lying/denying/falsifying , (an insistent) disbeliever
If God wanted/intended that (E) He takes a child (son), He would have chosen/purified from who He created, what He wills/wants, His praise/glory, He is God, the one the defeator/conqueror (E)
He created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, with the truth . He rotates/rolls the night on (to) the daytime, and He rotates/rolls the daytime on (to) the night, and He manipulated/subjugated the sun and the moon, each/all flows/orbits to a term/time, named/identified (specified), is He not the glorious/mighty , the forgiving/often forgiver
He created you from one self , then He made/created from it, its spouse , and He descended for you from the camels/livestock eight pairs/kinds (refer to 6:143 and 6:144), He creates you, in your mothers` bellies/insides, a creation from after a creation, in 3 darknesses (trimesters), that one, (is) God, your Lord, for Him (is) the kingdom/ownership (there is) no god except Him, so how/where (do) you be diverted/misguided
If you disbelieve, so then God (is) rich from (without) you, and He does not accept/approve the disbelief to His worshippers/slaves , and if you thank/be grateful He accepts/approves it for you, and no sinner/loader/burdener carries/bears another`s sins/load/burden , then to your Lord (is) your return, so He informs you with what you were making/doing , that He truly (is) knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts)
And if harm touched the human, he called his Lord repenting/obeying to Him, then if he made him own a blessing/goodness from Him, he forgot what he was calling to Him from before, and he made/put to God equals (idols) to misguide from His way/path , say: "Live long/enjoy with your disbelief little , that you are from the fire`s owners/company
Or who he is obeying humbly/prolonging the prayer (during) the nights` hours, prostrating and standing/keeping up he fears the end (other life) and hopes/expects his lord`s mercy, say: "Do (they) become equal/alike, those who know and those who do not know?" But (owners) of the pure minds/hearts mention/remember
Say: "You my worshippers/slaves those who believed, fear and obey your Lord, to those who did good in this the present world (is) a goodness/beauty, and God`s earth/Planet Earth/land (is) spread/abundant , truly the patient are fulfilled/completed their reward without (an) account/calculation
Say: "That I, I was ordered/commanded that (E) I worship God, faithful/loyal/devoted (in) the religion
And I was ordered/commanded to that (E) I be first (of) the Moslems/submitters/ surrenderers
Say: "That I, I fear if I disobeyed my Lord (from) a great day`s/time`s torture
Say: "God, I worship faithful/loyal/devoted to Him (in) my religion
So worship what you wanted from other that Him, say: "That (E) the losers , those who lost their selves and their families/peoples (on) the Day of the Resurrection , is that not it is the loss , the clear/evident
For them from above them shades from the fire , and from below/beneath them shades, that God He frightens with it His worshippers/slaves , you My worshipper/slaves , so fear and obey Me
And those who avoided/distanced the idols/every thing worshipped other than God that (E) they worship it, and they repented/obeyed to God, for them (is) the good news, so announce good news (to) My worshippers/slaves
Those who hear/listen (to) the word/opinion and belief so they follow its best , those are, those whom God guided them, and those, they are (owners) of the pure minds/hearts
Is who the torture`s words became true/deserved on him, so do you save/rescue who is in the fire
But those who feared and obeyed their Lord, for them (are) chambers from above it chambers built/constructed, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, God`s promise, God does not break the appointment (promise)
Do you not see/understand, that (E) God descended from the sky water, so He made it flow/pass (into) water springs/wells in the Earth/land , then He brings out with it plants/crops its colours (are) different, then (it) dries and yellows so you see it yellow/yellowish, then He makes it broken/debris/crumbs ,that (E) in that (is) a remembrance/reminder (E) to (owners) of the pure minds/hearts
Is who God delighted/expanded his chest (innermost) to the Islam/submission/ surrender (to God) so he is on light from his Lord; so calamity/scandal to (whom of ) the cruel/hard/merciless (are) their hearts/minds from God`s remembrance/reminder, those (are) in clear/evident misguidance
God descended the information`s/speech`s best , a Book looking alike/resembling/ similar doubles of twos Koranic verses , (the) skins (of) those who fear their Lord tremble/shiver from it, then their skins and their hearts/minds soften to God`s remembrance/reminder, that (is) God`s guidance, He guides with it whom He wills/wants, and who God misguides so (there is) none from a guide for him
Is who fears with his face/front the torture`s bad/evil/harm (on) the Resurrection Day, and was said to the unjust/oppressive taste/experience what you were gaining/acquiring
Those from before them lied/denied/falsified, so the torture came to them from where/when they do not feel/know/sense
So God made them taste/experience the shame/disgrace/scandal in the life the present/worldly life, and the end`s (other life`s) torture (E) (is) greater if they were knowing
And We had given to the people in this the Koran from every/each example/proverb, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember
An Arabic a Koran , without/other than of bent/crookedness/indirectness, maybe/perhaps they fear and obey
God gave an example/proverb (of) a man, adversaries/ill-mannered/quarrelsome partners (subject of controversy is) in him, (and) a man peaceful/secure/without blemish , to a man, do they (B) become equal/alike (in) an example/proverb? The praise/gratitude (is) to God, but most of them do not know
You truly are dying, and that they truly are dying
Then you truly are (on) the Resurrection Day at your Lord you dispute/controvert/argue
So who (is) more unjust/oppressive than who lied/denied/falsified on (about) God and lied/denied/falsified with the truth when it came to him, is not in Hell (a) home/residence to the disbelievers
And who came with the truth, and he confirmed with it, those, they are the fearing and obeying
For them what they want at their Lord, that (is) the good doers` reimbursement
(It is for) God to cover/substitute from them (the) worst deeds which they made/did , and He rewards/reimburses their reimbursement with best (of) which they were making/doing
Is not God with sufficing/protecting His worshipper/slave ? And they frighten you with those who (are) from other than Him, and whom God misguides, so (there is) none from a guide for him
And whom God guides, so (there is) none from a misguider for him, is not God with glorious/mighty (owner) of revenge/punishment
And if (E) you asked/questioned them: "Who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth?" They will say (E): "God." Say: "Did you see/understand what you call from other than God, if God wanted/intended me with harm, are they (F) removers/uncoverers (relievers) (of) His harm? Or He wanted/intended me with mercy, are they (F) withholders/seizers (of) His mercy?" Say: "Enough for me God, on Him rely/depend the reliant/dependent
Say: "You my nation, make/do on your capacity/position , that I am making/doing so you will/shall know
Who comes to him (gets a) torture (that) shames/disgraces him and places/resides on him (a) continuous torture
We (E) descended on (to) you The Book for the people with the truth , so who guided, so to himself, and who misguided so but he misguides on it, and you are not then with a guardian/protector/trustee
God makes the selves die (at the) time of its death/lifelessness, and which did not die in its sleep , so He holds/seizes which He ordered the death/lifelessness on it, and He sends the other (others) to a named/identified (specified) term/time, that (E) truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation thinking
Or they took from other than God mediators, say: "Even if they were not owning/possessing a thing, and nor reasoning/comprehending
Say: "To God (is) the mediation all/all together, for Him (is) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s ownership/kingdom, then to Him you are being returned
And if God was mentioned/remembered alone (the) hearts/minds (of) those who do not believe with the end (other life) became uptight/repulsed , and if those from other than Him were mentioned/remembered then they are announcing good news/rejoicing
Say: "Oh, You God, creator/bringer to being (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, knower (of) the unseen/hidden and the testimony/presence , You judge/rule between Your worshippers/slaves in what they were in it differing/disputing
And if that (E) to those who were unjust/oppressive what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all/all together, and equal to it with it, they would have ransomed/compensated with it from the torture`s evil/harm (on) the Resurrection Day, and it appeared to them from God what they were not thinking/supposing
And it appeared to them (the) sins/crimes (of) what they earned/acquired ; and what they were with it mocking surrounded/encircled with them
So if harm touched the human/mankind he called Us, then if We gave him generously/granted him a blessing/goodness from Us, he said: "But/truly I got it on knowledge." But it is a test/allurement , and but most of them do not know
Those from before them had said it, so what they were gaining/acquiring did not enrich/suffice from them
so struck/marked them sins/crimes (of) what they gained/acquired , and those who caused injustice/oppression from those, sins/crimes (of) what they gained/acquired will mark/strike them ,and they are not with disabling/frustrating
Do they not see/understand that God spreads/extends the provision to whom He wills/wants, and He is capable/able ? That truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation believing
Say: "You my worshippers/slaves those who neglected/ignored on themselves, do not despair from God`s mercy, that truly God forgives the crimes all/all together, that truly He is the forgiving, the merciful
And repent/obey to your Lord, and submit/surrender to Him, from before that the torture comes to you, then you do not be given victory/aid
And follow best (of) what was descended to you from your Lord from before that the torture comes to you suddenly/unexpectedly, and (while) you do not know/feel/sense
That (E) a self says: "Oh my grief/sadness on what I neglected/abused/wasted in God`s side/direction/right, and that truly I was from (E) the humiliators/mockers
Or it says: "If that (E) God guided me, I would have been (E) from the fearing and obeying
Or it says when it sees the torture: "If that (E) for me (is) a return/repeat/second time , so I be from the good doers
Yes/certainly, My evidences/verses came to you, so you lied/denied/falsified with it, and you became arrogant, and you were from the disbelievers
And (on) the Resurrection Day, you see/understand those who lied/denied/falsified on (about) God, their face/fronts (are) blackened, is not in Hell (a) home/residence/dwelling to the arrogant
And God saves/rescues those who feared and obeyed with their winning/success/triumph , the bad/evil/harm does not touch them, and nor they be sad/grieving
God (is) creator (of) every thing and He is on every thing a blessor/fulfiller/guardian
For Him (are) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s keys/safes (management and control), and those who disbelieved with God`s evidences/signs/verses, those, they are the losers
Say: "So is other than God you order/command me (that) I worship, you the lowly/ignorant
And (it) had been (E) inspired/transmitted to you and to those from before you, if (E) you shared/made partners (with God), your deed will be wasted/invalidated (E) , and you will be (E) from the losers
But/rather God, so worship, and be from the thankful/grateful
And they did not evaluate/estimate God, His correct/true evaluation/estimation, and the earth/Planet Earth all/all together (on) the Resurrection Day (is in) His hand hold/grasp , and the skies/space (are) folded/rolled at/by His right , His praise/glory about what they share/make partners (with Him)
And (it) was blown in the horn/bugle/instrument so who (was) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth fainted from thunderous noise/died , except whom God willed/wanted, then (it) was blown in it another (time), so then they are getting up/standing looking
And the earth/Planet Earth brightened/shined with/from its Lord`s light, and The Book/judgment/record was put/laid , and came with the prophets and the witnesses/testifiers/those killed in God`s sake (martyrs), and was passed judgment between them with the truth , and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed
And every self was fulfilled/completed what it made/did , and He is more knowledgeable about what they make/do
And those who disbelieved are driven to Hell (in) groups/gangs until when they came to it, (then) its doors/entrances were opened, and its safe keepers said to them: "Did not messengers from you come to you, they read/recite on (to) you your Lord`s evidences/verses , and they warn/give you notice (of) this your day/time, this meeting (today`s meeting)?" They said: "Yes/certainly." And but the torture`s words/expression became deserved/a fact on the disbelievers
(It) is said: "Enter Hell`s doors/entrances, immortally/eternally in it, so how bad (is) the arrogants` residence/dwelling
And those who feared and obeyed their Lord are driven to the Paradise (in) groups/companies until if they came to it, and its doors opened and its safe keepers said to them: "Peace/security/greeting on (to) you, you became good/beautiful/pure, so enter it immortally/eternally
And they said: "The praise/glory (is) to God who was truthful to us (in) His promise, and made us inherit the earth/Planet Earth, we reside/settle from the Paradise where/when we will/want, so is blessed/ praised (is) the maker`s/doer`s reward
And you see the angels gazing and surrounding/circling from around the throne , they praise/glorify with their Lord`s praise/glory, and was judged between them with the truth and was said: "The praise/gratitude (is) to God, the creations all together`s/(universes) Lord

The Book`s descent from God, the glorious/mighty , the knowledgeable
The crime`s forgiver, and the repentances` acceptor, strong (severe in) the punishment, (owner) of the wealth/might , (there is) no God except Him, to Him (is) the end/destination
None argue/dispute in God`s evidences/verses except those who disbelieved, so let not their turning/returning in the countries/lands deceive/tempt you
Noah`s nation lied/denied/falsified before them, and the groups/parties from after them, and every/each nation intended/began with their messenger to take/punish him , and they argued/disputed with the falsehood to nullify with it the truth , so I punished/took them so how was My punishment
And like that, your Lord`s word/expression became correct/true on those who disbelieved, that they are the fire`s owners/company
Those who carry/lift the throne and who (is) around/surrounding it, they praise/glorify with their Lord`s praise/gratitude/thanks, and they believe with (in) Him, and they ask for forgiveness to (for) those who believed; (say): "Our Lord, you extended/contained/ widened over every thing (with) mercy and knowledge, so forgive to those who repented and they followed Your way/path , and protect them (from) the Hell`s torture
Our Lord, and enter them (into) treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence, which You promised them, and who was correct/repaired from their fathers/forefathers, and their spouses , and their descendants, that You are, You are the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious
And protect them (from) the sins/crimes; and whom You protect/preserve from the sins/crimes (on) that day, so You had mercy upon him, and that it is the winning/success , the great
That truly those who disbelieved they are being called: "God`s hatred/abhorrence (E) (is) greater than your hatred/abhorrence (to) yourselves if/when you are being called to the faith/belief so you disbelieve
They said: "Our Lord You made us die two (twice), and You revived us/gave us life two (twice), so we confessed/acknowledged with our crimes, so is (there) from a way/path to getting out/(an) exit
This is with that it is if God was called alone, you disbelieved, and if He be shared with/be made a partner with Him, you believe (with that), so the judgment/rule (is) to God, the high/elevated, the great
He (is) who shows you/makes you understand His verses/evidences , and He descends for you from the sky provision , and none mentions/remembers except who repents/obeys
So call God faithful/loyal/devoted to him (in) the religion, and even if the disbelievers hated (it)
Raiser/honourer (of) the steps/stages/degrees, (owner) of the throne , He throws the Soul/Spirit from His order/command on (to) whom He wills/wants from His worshippers/slaves to warn/give notice (of) the Meeting Day/Resurrection Day
A day/time they are emerging/appearing, not a thing from them hides on (from) God; to whom (is) the kingdom/ownership the day/today? To God the one, the defeator/conqueror
The day/today every/each self is being reimbursed with what it gathered/acquired , no injustice/oppression the day/today, that truly God (is) quick/speedy (in) the account/calculation
And warn/give notice (of) the Resurrection Day when the hearts/minds (are) at/by the larynxes/voice boxes (throats), holding/suppressing (themselves), (there is) no concerned (relative/friend), and nor a mediator (to) be obeyed to the unjust/oppressive
He knows the eyes`/sights` betrayal/unfaithfulness (E), and what the chests (innermosts) hide
And God passes judgment/orders with the truth , and those whom they call from other than Him, they do not pass judgment/order/accomplish with a thing, that truly God, He is the hearing/listening, the seeing/knowing
Do they not walk/move/ride in the land/Planet Earth , so they see/wonder about how was those who were from before them`s end/turn (result)? They, they were, stronger than them (in) strength/power, and tracks/historical remains in the earth/Planet Earth, so God punished/took them because (of) their crimes, and (there) was not for them from a protector/preserver from God
That (is) because they (E), their messengers were coming to them with the evidences, so they disbelieved, so God punished/took them , that He truly is strong, strong (severe in) the punishment
And We had (E) sent Moses with Our verses/evidences/signs, and a clear/evident proof/power
To Pharaoh, and Haman , and Qaroon/Korah , so they said: "A liar/falsifier , magician/sorcerer
So when He came to them with the truth from at Us, they said: "Kill/fight (the) sons of those who believed with him, and shame/keep alive their women, and the disbelievers` plot/conspiracy (is) not except in misguidance
And Pharaoh said: "Leave me (to) kill Moses, and he should call his Lord, that I, I fear that (E) he exchanges/replaces your religion, and that (E) he makes the corruption in the earth/Planet Earth apparent/visible
And Moses said: "That I seeked protection with (from) my Lord, and your Lord, from every arrogant (that) does not believe, with (in) the Account Day/Resurrection Day
And a man believing from Pharaoh`s family, he hides/conceals his faith/belief said: "Do you kill a man that (E) he says, my Lord is God? And he had come to you with the evidences from your Lord, and if he be a liar/falsifier so on him his lies/defiance/falsification, and if he be truthful, some of which he promises you strikes you ,that truly God does not guide who he is (a) waster/extravagator , liar/denier/falsifier
You my nation, for you (is) the kingdom/ownership the day/today, conquering/defeating in the earth/Planet Earth, so who gives us victory/aid from God`s courage/might/power, if (it) came to us? Pharaoh said: "I do not show you/make you understand except what I see/understand, and I do not guide you except the corrects/right guidance`s way/path
And who believed said: "You my nation, that I, I fear on (for) you, equal/alike to day (of) the groups/parties
Equal/alike (to) Noah`s, and Aad`s, and Thamud`s habit/affair, and those from after them, and God does not want injustice/oppression to the worshippers/slaves
And you my nation, that I, I fear on (for) you the Calling Day/Resurrection Day
A day/time you turn away giving your backs, no protector/shelterer (is) for you from God, and whom God misguides, so (there is) no guide for him
And Joseph had come to you from before with the evidences, so you are still continuing in doubt/suspicion from what he came to you with it, until when he perished/died, you said: `God will never/not send from after him a messenger.` as/like that God misguides whom He is (a) waster/extravagator , doubtful/suspicious
Those who argue/dispute in God`s evidences/verses/signs without a proof/evidence (that) came to them, abhorrence/hatred became big at God, and at those who believed, as/like that God stamps/seals on every/each arrogant tyrant/merciless heart/mind
And Pharaoh said: "You Haman , build/construct a palace/towering building for me, maybe/perhaps I reach the reasons/motives
The skies`/space`s reasons/connections so I look/see to Moses` God, and that I think/suppose (E) him (to be) a liar/denier/falsifier. And as/like that (it) was decorated/beautified to Pharaoh, his deed`s bad/evil ,and he was prevention/obstruction from the way/path , and Pharaoh`s plot/conspiracy is not except in destruction/loss
And who believed said: "You my nation, follow me, I guide you the correct/right guidance`s way/path
You my nation, truly this the life the present/worldly life (is) enjoyment , and that truly the end (other life) it is the settlement`s house/home
Who made/did a sin/crime so (he) will not be reimbursed except equal/alike to it, and who made/did correct/righteous deeds from a male or a female, and he is believing, so those they enter the Paradise, (they are) being provided for in it, without account/calculation
And you my nation, why (is it) for me (that) I call you to the salvation/rescue , and you call me (E) to the fire
You call me (E) to disbelieve with God, and I share/make partners with Him, what is not for me with it knowledge, and I call you to the glorious/mighty , the forgiving often/forgiver
Undoutably/certainly that what you call me (E) to it, a call/request/prayer is not for him/it in the present world and nor in the end (other life), and that (E) our return (is) to God, and that (E) the wasters/extravagators , they are the fire`s friends/company
So you will remember what I say to you, and I authorize/entrust/empower my matter/affair to God, that truly God (is) seeing/knowing/understanding with the worshippers/slaves
So God protected/preserved him (from) what they plotted/conspired (in) sins/crimes, and was surrounded/encircled with Pharaoh`s family, the torture`s bad/evil/harm
The fire they are being displayed/exhibited on (to) it, (at) early morning and (at) evening/first darkness , and a day/time the Hour/Resurrection starts Pharaoh`s family enter (in) the torture`s strongest
And when they argue/quarrel in the fire , so the weak say to those who became arrogant: "That we, we were for you following, so are you enriching/sufficing from us a share from the fire
Those who became arrogant said: "We (E) all/each (are) in it, that truly God had judged/ruled between the worshippers/slaves
And those in the fire said to Hell`s safe keepers: "Call your Lord, (to) reduce/lighten from us a day from the torture
They said: "Were your messengers not being coming to you with the evidences?" They said: "Yes/certainly." They said: "So call, and the disbelievers` call/prayer (is) not except in misguidance
We (E), We give victory/aid (to) Our messengers and those who believed in the life the present/worldly life, and a day/time the witnesses/testifiers stand/get up
A day/time, the unjust/oppressive, their apologies/excuses do not benefit (them), and for them (is) the curse/torture, and for them the house`s/home`s bad/evil/harm
And We had (E) given Moses the guidance, and We made Israel`s sons and daughters inherit The Book
Guidance and a remembrance/reminder to (owners) of the pure hearts/minds
So be patient that truly God`s promise (is) true , and ask for forgiveness for your crime, and praise/glorify with your Lord`s praise/gratitude at the evening/first darkness and the day breaks/early morning
That truly those who argue/dispute in God`s evidences/verses/signs without a proof/evidence/authority (that) came to them, that (E) in the chests (innermosts is) except arrogance/great sin/disbelief and sharing , they are not with reaching it, so seek protection by God, that He truly is the hearing/listening, the seeing/knowing
Creation (E) (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth (is) greater than the people`s creation, and but most of the people do not know
And the blind, and the seeing do not become equal, and those who believed, and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and nor the sinner/criminal, little (is) what you mention/remember
That truly the Hour/Resurrection is coming (E) no doubt/suspicion in it, and but most of the people do not believe
And your Lord said: "Call Me, I answer/reply to you, that truly those who are being arrogant from worshipping Me they will enter Hell degraded/lowly
God (is) who made/created for you the night to be tranquil/settled in it, and the daytime to see (clearly lit) , that truly God (is owner) of grace/favour/blessing on the people, and but most of the people do not thank/be grateful
That (is) God, your Lord creator (of) every thing, (there is) no God except Him, so how/when (are) you being turned away
As/like that those who were with God`s verses/evidences/signs disbelieving and denying are being turned away
God is who made/created for you, the earth/Planet Earth (as) a settlement , and the sky/space (a) structure , and He pictured/shaped you , so He did good (perfected in) your pictures/shapes/forms, and He provided you from the goodnesses , that (is) God, your Lord, so blessed (is) God the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
He is the live/alive, (there is) no god except Him, so call Him faithful/loyal/devoted to him (in) the religion/faith, the praise/gratitude (is) to God the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
Say: "That I, I was forbidden/prohibited that (E) I worship those whom you worship from other than God when the evidences came to me from my lord, and I was ordered/commanded that (E) I surrender/submit/become Moslem to the creations altogether`s/(universes`) Lord
He is who created you from dust/earth, then from a drop/male`s or female`s secretion , then from a blood clot/sperm/semen , then He brings you out (as) a child/children, then to reach your maturity/strength, then to be (E) old aged , and from you whom (is) made to die from before, and to reach a named/identified (specified) term/time, and maybe/perhaps you reason/comprehend
He is who revives/makes alive, and makes die, so if He passed judgment (in) a matter/affair/order/ command, so but He says to it: "Be." So it becomes
Do you not see/understand to those who argue/dispute in God`s verses/evidences/signs, where/how (do) they be diverted/misguided
Those who lied/denied/falsified with The Book and with what We sent Our messengers with it, so they will know
When the leather or iron collars or handcuffs (are) in their necks, and (with) the chains they be dragged on the ground
In the hot/cold water , then in the fire they overflow/burn and refuel
Then (it) was said to them: "Where (are) what you were sharing/making partners
From other than God? They said: "They were misguided from us, but we were not calling from before a thing." As/like that God misguides the disbelievers
That (is) because (of) what you were being happy/rejoiceful/delighted in the earth/Planet Earth without the right/truth , and because (of) what you were being lively and joyful
Enter Hell`s doors/entrances, immortally/eternally in it, so how bad (is) the arrogant`s home/residence/dwelling
So be patient, that truly God`s promise (is) true/truth , so either We show you/make you understand some of which We promise them, or We make you die, so to Us they be returned
And We had (E) sent messengers from before you, from them whom We relayed/informed on (to) you, and from them whom We did not relay/inform on (to) you; and (it) was not to a messenger that (E) He comes345with an evidence/verse/sign except with God`s permission , so if God`s order/command came, judgment was passed/ordered with the truth , and at that place and time the wasters/falsifiers lost
God (is) who made/created for you the camels/livestock to ride from it, and from it you eat
And for you in it (are) benefits/uses, and to reach on it a need/necessity in your chests (innermosts), and on it and on the ship/ships you be carried/loaded
And He shows/makes you understand His verses/signs/evidences, so which (of) God`s verses/signs/evidences (do) you deny
Do they not walk/move in the earth/Planet Earth, so they see/wonder about how was those from before them`s end/turn (result)? They were more than them, and stronger (in) strength/power and tracks/historical remains in the earth/Planet Earth, so what they were gaining/acquiring did not enrich/suffice from them (in a thing)
So when their messengers came to them with the evidences, they became happy/rejoiced/delighted with what (is) at them from the knowledge; and what they were with it mocking/making fun surrounded/afflicted with them
So when they saw/understood Our might/power they said: "We believed with (in) God alone, and we disbelieved with what we were with Him sharing/making partners
So their belief did not be beneficial (to) them when they saw/understood Our might/power , God`s law/manner which had past in His worshippers/slaves , and the disbelievers lost at that place and time

Descent from the merciful, the most merciful
A Book its verses were detailed/explained/clarified, an Arabic Koran to a nation reasoning/comprehending/knowing
An announcer of good news and a warner/giver of notice , so most of them objected/opposed , so they do not hear/listen
And they said: "Our hearts/minds (are) in covers/protections from what you call us to it, and in our ears (is a) weight/deafness , and from between us and between you (is) a divider/partition , so make/do , that we truly are making/doing
Say: "But/truly I am a human equal/alike to you (it) is being transmitted/revealed to me that your Lord (is) one God, so be straight/direct to Him, and ask Him for forgiveness, and calamity/Hell to the sharers/takers of partners (with God)
Those who do not give/bring the charity/purification , and they are with the end (other life), they are disbelieving
That truly those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, for them (is) a reward/wage not interrupted/weakened (continuous)
Say: "Do you disbelieve (E) with who created the earth/Planet Earth in two days, and you make/put for Him equals (idols), that (is) the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
And He made/put in it anchors/fixtures/mountains from above it, and He blessed in it, and He predestined/evaluated in it its provision in four days, straight/equal to the askers/questioners
Then He aimed/tended to the sky/space and it is smoke/fumes, so He said to it and to the earth/Planet Earth: "You (B) come voluntarily or forcefully/involuntarily ." They (B) said: "We came obedient
So He ordered/accomplished them (as) seven skies/space(s) in two days, and He inspired/transmitted in every/each sky/space its matter/affair/order/command, and We decorated/beautified the present world`s sky/space with lights/stars and a protection/ observation , that (is) the glorious`/mighty`s , the knowledgeable`s predestination/ evaluation
So if they objected/opposed , so say: "I warned/gave you notice (of) a fire falling from the sky accompanied by thunderous noise/destructive torture equal/alike to Aad and Thamud`s fire falling from the sky accompanied by thunderous noise/destructive torture
When the messengers came to them from between their hands and from behind them: "That do not worship except God." They said: "If our Lord wanted/willed, He would have descended angels, so we are with what you were sent with it disbelieving
So but Aad they became arrogant in the earth/Planet Earth without the right/truth , and they said: "Who (is) stronger than us (in) strength/power?" Do they not see/understand that (E) God (is) who created them, He is stronger than them (in) strength/power, and they were with Our evidences/verses/signs disbelieving and deny ing
So We sent on (to) them a severely cold/roaring wind/breeze in unlucky/miserable days/times, to make them taste/experience the shame`s/scandal`s/disgrace`s torture in the life the present/worldly life, and the end`s (other life`s) torture (E) (is) more shameful/scandalous/disgraceful, and they are not being given victory/aid
And but Thamud, so We guided them so they loved/liked the blindness/misguidance more, over the guidance, so the torture the humiliating/disgraceful cry of torture/destructive torture punished/took them because of what they were gaining/acquiring
And We saved/rescued those who believed and were fearing and obeying
And a day/time God`s enemies be gathered to the fire , so they are being restrained/held back
Until when they came to it! Their hearing/listening , and their eye sights/understanding, and their skins testified/witnessed on them because (of) what they were making/doing
And they said to their skins: "Why (did) you witness/testify on us?" They said: "God who made every thing speak, made us speak, and He created you (the) first/beginning time , and to Him you are being returned
And you were not covering/hiding yourselves that (E) your hearing/listening , and nor your eye sights/understanding, and nor your skins witnesses/testifies on (against) you, and but you thought/assumed that (E) God does not know much from what you made/do
And that (is) your thought/assumption which you thought/assumed with your Lord, He made you fall/ruin so you became from the losers
So if they be patient so the fire (is a) residence/dwelling for them, and if they offer reconciliation , so they are not from the permitted to offer reconciliation
And We predestined/assigned for them companions , so they decorated/beautified for them what (is) between their hands, and what (is) behind them, and the saying/words became true/truth on them in nations (that) had passed from before them from the Jinns, and the human/mankind, that they truly were losers
And those who disbelieved said: "Do not hear/listen to that the Koran , and cancel/abolish/nullify in it, maybe/perhaps you defeat/conquer
So We will make those who disbelieved taste/experience (E) a strong (severe) torture, and We will reimburse them (the) worst deeds (of) what they were making/doing
That (is) God`s enemies` reimbursement , the fire, for them in it (is) the immortality`s/eternity`s house/home (permanent residence), reimbursement because (of) what they were with Our verses/evidences/signs disbelieving and denying
And those who disbelieved said: "Our Lord, show us those (B) who misguided us from the Jinns and the human/mankind, we make/put them (B) below/under our feet, to be (B) from the lowest/meanest
That truly those who said: "Our Lord (is) God." Then they became straight/direct, the angels descend on them (and say): "That you do not fear and nor be saddened/grieved, and be announced good news to with (about) the Paradise which you were being promised
We are your guardians/allies in the life the present/worldly life and in the end (other life), and for you in it what yourselves desire/crave , and for you in it what you call/wish/desire
Descent from a forgiver, merciful
And who (is) better (in) a word/opinion and belief than who called to God and made/did correct/righteous deeds, and he said: "That I am (E) from the Moslems/submitters/surrenderers
And the good/goodness does not become equal/alike and nor the sin/crime, pay/push/repel with which it is best , so then who (is) between you and between him animosity as though/as if he (is a) concerned guardian/ally
And none receives/finds it except those who were patient, and none receives/finds it except (owners) of great luck/fortune
And if from the devil an urge to spoil/do evil urges you to spoil/do evil (E), so seek protection by God, that He truly, He is the hearing/listening , the knowledgeable
And from His verses/evidences/signs (are) the night and the daytime and the sun and the moon, do not prostrate to the sun and nor to the moon, and prostrate to God who created them (B), if you were/are (only) Him worshipping
So if they became arrogant, so those who (are) at your Lord they praise/glorify to Him by the night and the daytime, and they do not get bored/tired
And from His verses/evidences/signs, that you see the earth/Planet Earth humble/submissive , so if/when We descended on it the water, it shook/moved and it grew/increased, that truly who revived it (is) reviving (E) the deads, that He truly (is) on every thing capable/able
That truly those who deviate, insult and defame God in Our verses/evidences/signs, they are not hidden on (from) Us. Is who is being thrown in the fire better or who comes safe/secure (on) the Resurrection Day? Make/do what you willed/wanted, that He truly is with what you make/do seeing/knowing
That truly those who disbelieved with the reminder/remembrance when (it) came to them, and that it truly is a glorious/mighty Book (E)
The falsehood does not come to it from between its hand and nor from behind it, descent from (the) wise/judicious, praiseworthy/commendable
(It) is not said to you except what had been said to the messengers from before you, that truly your Lord (is owner) of (E) a forgiveness and (owner) of a painful punishment
And if We made it a non-Arabic/Persian Koran , they would have said: "If only its verses were detailed/explained . Is (it) a non-Arabic/Persian (Koran) and an Arab (messenger)?" Say: "It is to those who believed guidance and a cure/recovery/healing; and those who do not believe, in their ears (is a) weight/heaviness and it is on them blindness/confusion , those, they are being called, from a far/distant place/position
And We had given/brought Moses The Book , so it was disputed in it, and where it not for a word (that) proceeded from your Lord, (it) would have been executed between them, and that they truly are in doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from it
Who made/did correct/righteous deeds, so for himself, and who did bad/evil/harm so on (for) it, and your Lord (is) not with an unjust/oppressor to the worshippers
To Him the Hour`s/Resurrection`s knowledge be returned, and none emerges from fruits from its buds/covers from which they emerge, and none from a female conceives/(is) pregnant with/carries , and nor gives birth/drops except with His knowledge, and a day/time He calls them: "Where (are) my p artners?" They said: "We took your leave, we informed you , none from an honest witness/testifier is from us
And what they were calling from before misguided/lost from them, and they thought/assumed nothing from (an) escape/diversion (is) for them (there is no escape for them)
The human/mankind does not get bored/tired from the goodness` call/request/prayer , and if the bad/evil/harm touched him, so he is despairing/hopeless despaired
And if (E) We made him taste/experience mercy from Us, from after calamity/disastrous distress touched him, he will say (E): "That (is) for me, and I do not think/assume the Hour/Resurrection (is) starting , and if (E) I was returned to my Lord, that truly for me at Him (is) the best/most beautiful/goodness (E)." So We will inform those who disbelieved with what they made/did , and We will make them taste/experience (E) from a strong/rough torture
And if We blessed/comforted and eased on the human/mankind he objected/opposed and he went far with his side/direction, and if the bad/evil/harm touched him, so (he is owner) of (a) wide/broad call/request/prayer
Say: "Did you see/understand if (it) was from at God, then you disbelieved with (in) it, who (is) more misguided than who he is in far/distant defiance/animosity
We will show them/make them understand Our verses/signs/evidences in the horizons/directions and in their selves, until (it) becomes clear/explained for them that it (is) the truth . Is (it) not enough/sufficient with your Lord, that He truly is on every thing witnessing/testifying
Is (it) not that they truly are in doubt from meeting their Lord? Is (it) not that He truly is with every thing surrounding/encircling
H M
En S/K
As/like that God inspires/transmits to you, and to those from before you, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious
For Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, and He is the high and mighty/dignified, the great
The skies/space are about to/almost split/crack/cleave from above them, and the angels praise/glorify with their Lord`s praise/gratitude/thanks, and they ask for forgiveness to whom (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, is (it) not that truly God, He is the forgiving, the merciful
And those who took from other than Him guardians/allies , God (is an) observer on them, and you are not on them with a guardian/protector
And as/like that We inspired/transmitted to you an Arabic Koran to warn/give notice to the mother/origin (of) the villages/urban cities and who (is) around/surrounding it, and warn/give notice (of) the Gathering Day/Resurrection Day, (there is) no doubt/suspicion in it, a group/party/flock (are) in the Paradise, and a group/party/flock (are) in the blazing/inflamed (inferno)
And if God wanted/willed He would have made them one nation, and but He enters in His mercy whom He wills/wants, and the unjust/oppressive (there is) none for them from a guardian/ally and nor (a) victorior/savior
Or they took from other than Him guardians/allies , so God, He is the guardian/ally , and He revives/makes alive the deads, and He is on every thing capable/able
And what you differed/disagreed/disputed in it from a thing, so its judgment/rule (is) to God, that one (is) God, my Lord, on Him I relied/depended , and to Him I return/repent/obey
Creator/bringer to being (of) the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, He made/created for you from yourselves spouses/pairs/kinds , and from the camels/livestock spouses/pairs/kinds , He creates/seeds you in it, (there) is not like Him/similar to Him a thing, and He is the hearing/listening, the seeing
For Him (are) the skies`/space`s keys/safes (management and control), He spreads/extends the provision to whom He wills/wants, and He is capable/able , that He truly (is) with every thing knowledgeable
He explained/showed for you from the religion what He directed/commanded with it Noah, and what We inspired/transmitted to you, and what We directed/commanded with it Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus, that (E) keep up/call for the religion, and do not separate in it, (it) became big/a burden on the sharers/takers of partners with God, what you call them to it, God chooses/purifies to Him whom He wills/wants, and He guides to Him who returns/repents/obeys
And they did not separate except from after the knowledge came to them, oppression/transgression between them, and where it not (for) a word/expression preceded from your Lord to a named/identified (specified) term/time, (it) would have been executed/ended (E) between them, and that truly those who were made to inherit The Book from after them (are) in (E) doubtful/suspicious doubt/suspicion from it
So to/for that so call, and be straight/direct, as/like you were ordered/commanded, and do not follow their self attractions for desires , and say: "I believed with what God descended from a Book , and I was ordered/commanded to be just/equitable between you, God (is) our Lord and your Lord, for us (are) our deeds, and for you (are) your deeds, no argument between us and between you, God gathers/collects between us, and to Him (is) the end/destination
And those who argue/dispute/quarrel in (about) God from after what was answered/replied to Him, their argument (is) annulled at their Lord, and on them (is) anger, and for them (is) a painful torture
God (is) who descended The Book with the truth , and the scale/measuring instrument , and what makes you know/informs you, maybe/perhaps the Hour/Resurrection (is) near/close
Those who do not believe with (in) it hasten/urge with it, and those who believed (are) afraid/cautious from it, and they know that it (E) (is) the truth , is (it) not that truly those who argue/discuss in the Hour/Resurrection (are) in (E) far/distant misguidance
God (is) kind/courteous/soothing with His worshippers/slaves , He provides for whom He wills/wants, and He is the powerful/strong, the glorious/mig hty
Who was wanting/intending the end`s (other life`s) cultivation/plantation (enjoyment), We increase for him his cultivation/plantation (enjoyment), and who was wanting/intending the present world`s cultivation/plantation (enjoyment), We give/bring him from it, and (there is) no share/ luck/fortune for him in the end (other life)
Or for them (are) partners (with God who) explained/showed to them from the religion what God did not permit/allow with it? Where it not for the judgment`s/decision`s word/expression , (it) would have been judged/executed between them, and that truly the unjust/oppressive, for them (is) a painful torture
You see the unjust/oppressive afraid/cautions from what they gathered/acquired , and it is falling/landing with (on) them, and those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds (are) in the Paradise`s gardens/meadows , for them what they want at their Lord, that it is the grace/favour/blessing, the great
That (is) what God announced good news (to) His worshippers/slaves , those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, say: "I do not ask/question/demand you on (for) it a reward/wage except the love/affection in the relations/near." And who perpetrates/does a good/goodness, We increase goodness/beauty for him in it, that truly God (is) forgiving, thanked/thankful/grateful
Or they say: "He fabricated on (about) God lies/falsifications ." So if God wants, He seals/stamps on your heart/mind , and God eliminates/erases the falsehood, and God corrects/makes true the truth with His words/expressions, that He truly is knowledgeable with of the chests (innermosts)
And He is who accepts/receives the repentance from His worshippers/slaves , and He forgives/pardons of the sins/crimes, and He knows what you make/do
And He answers/replies to those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and He increases them from His grace/favour/blessing; and the disbelievers, for them (is) a strong (severe) torture
And if God spread/extended the provision to His worshippers/slaves, they would have oppressed/transgressed in the earth/Planet Earth, and but He descends with a measure/predestiny what He wills/wants, that He truly is with His worshippers/slaves expert/experienced, seeing/knowing
And He is who descends the rain from after what they despaired, and He spreads/extends His mercy, and He is the guardian/ally , the praiseworthy/commendable
And from His verses/evidences/signs (are) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s creation, and what He scattered/distributed in them (B) from a walker/creeper/crawler , and He is on gathering/collecting them if He wills/wants capable/able
What struck/hit you from a disaster so (it is) because (of) what your hands gathered/acquired ,and He forgives/pardons on much
And you are not with disabling/frustrating in the earth/Planet Earth, and (there is) nothing for you from other than God from a guardian/ally, and nor (a) victorior/savior
And from His signs/evidences (are) the ships in the sea/ocean like the signs/banners
If He wills/wants He stops/quietens the wind/breeze, so they continue/remain still/fixed in place on its back/surface , that truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to every/each patient/endurer, thankful/grateful
Or He destroys/perishes them because (of) what they gathered/acquired , and He forgives/pardons on much
And those who argue/dispute in Our verses/evidences know (there is) none from (an) escape/diversion for them
So what you were given from a thing so (it is) long life/enjoyment (of) the life the present/worldly life, and what (is) at God (is) better and more lasting (everlasting) to those who believed and on their Lord, they rely/depend
And those who avoid/distance themselves (from) the great/magnified sins`/crimes` biggest/greatest , and the enormous/atrocious deeds , and when they became angry, they forgive
And those who answered/replied to their Lord and they kept up the prayers, and their matter/affair (is by) consultation/advice between them, and from what We provided for them, they spend
And those who when/if the oppression/transgression struck/marked them , they become victorious
And a sin`s/crime`s reimbursement (is) a sin/crime equal to it , so who forgave/pardoned and corrected/repaired , so his reward (is) on God, that He truly does not love/like the unjust/oppressors
And who (E) became victorious after injustice/oppression to him, so those no way/path (blame) is on them
But the way/path (blame is) on those who cause injustice/oppression (to) the people, and they oppress/transgress in the earth/Planet Earth without the right/truth , those for them (is) a painful torture
And who (E) became patient and forgave, that truly that (is) from the matter`s/affair`s decisiveness/determination
And whom God misguided, so (there is) none from a guardian/ally for him from after Him, and you see the unjust/oppressors when they saw the torture, they say: "Is (there) from a way/path to return
And you see them they are being displayed/exhibited on it, humble/submissive from the humiliation/disgrace , they look/watch from a hidden end/edge/eyelid , and those who believed said: "That truly the losers (are) those who lost themselves and their families/relations (on) the Resurrection Day; are not the unjust/oppressors in a continuous torture
And (there) were none from guardians/allies from other than God for them, they give them victory/aid from other than God, and whom God misguides, so (there is) no way/path for him (no escape for him)
Answer/reply to your Lord from before that (E) a day/time comes (there be) no return (protection) to (from) it from God, none from a refuge/shelter (is) for you (on) that day, and none from defiance/ignorance (is) for you
So if they objected/opposed , so We did not send you on (to) them (as) a protector/guard , that truly on you (is nothing) except the information/communication, and We (E) if We made the human/mankind taste/experience mercy from Us, he became happy/rejoiced with it, and if a sin/crime strikes/marks them with because (of) what their hands advanced , so then the human/mankind (is an insistent) disbeliever
To God (is) the sky`s/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s ownership/kingdom, He creates what He wills/wants, He grants/presents to whom He wills/wants females, and He grants/presents to whom He wills/wants the males
Or He gets them married/couples males and females, and He makes/creates whom He wills/wants infertile, that He truly is knowledgeable, capable/able
And (it) was not to a human that (E) God converses/speaks to him , except (by) inspiration/transmission or from behind (a) divider/partition , or He sends a messenger so he (the messenger) inspires/transmits what He wills/wants with His permission , that He truly is high/elevated, wise/judicious
And like that We inspired/transmitted to you, a Soul/Spirit , from Our order/command/matter/affair, you were not knowing what (is) The Book , and nor the faith/belief, and but We made it a light, We guide with it whom We will/want from Our worshippers/slaves , and that you guide (E) to a straight/direct road/way
God`s road/way, who for Him what (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth, is (it) not to God the order`s/command`s/matter`s/affair`s end/destiny
H M
And The Book , the clear/evident
We (E) made it an Arabic Koran , maybe/perhaps you reason/comprehend
And that it truly is in The Books` mother/origin at Us (The Book`s origin is at Us), height and mighty (E) ,wise/judicious (full of wisdom)
Do We disregard/move from you the reminder/remembrance forgiveness/ condonation ? That (E) you were a nation (of) spoilers/neglecters
And how many We sent from a prophet in the first/beginners
And a prophet does not come to them except they were with him mocking/making fun
So We destroyed , (those who were) stronger than them violent destruction/attack, and the first`s/beginner`s proverb/example passed/expired
And if (E) you asked/questioned them: "Who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth?" They will say (E): "The glorious/mighty , the knowledgeable created them (B)
Who made/created for you the earth/Planet Earth spread/prepared , and He made/put for you in it roads/means , maybe/perhaps you be guided
And who descended from the sky/space water with a measure/predestiny , so We revived/resurrected with it a dead/lifeless land , as/like that you are being brought out
And who created the pairs/kinds all of them, and He created for you from the ship/ships and the camels/livestock what you ride/board
To sit on on its backs/surfaces , then you remember/mention your Lord`s blessing/goodness when you sat on it, and you say: "Praise/glory (to) who humiliated/subjugated for us this, and we were not to it overpowering/connecting (without God)
And that We are to our Lord returning (E)
And they made/put for Him from His worshippers/slaves a part/portion (partner), that truly the human/mankind (is a) a clear/evident (insisting) disbeliever (E)
Or He took/received from what He creates daughters, and he chose (specialized) you with sons
And if any of them was announced good news to with what He gave to the merciful (as) an example (the daughters), his face became/continued blackened, and he is holding (his) breath/suppressed
Is who (is) being brought up/originated in the ornament/decoration (luxuriated i.e.: girls and those effeminate and unmanly) and he is in the dispute/controversy/argument not evident/shown
And they made the angels those who they are the merciful`s worshippers/slaves (as) females, did they witness their creation? Their testimony/certification will be written , and they (will) be asked/questioned
And they said: "If the merciful willed/wanted we would not have worshipped them, none from knowledge with that (is) for them, that truly they are except lying/speculating
Or We gave them a Book from before it, so they are with it holding/seizing/ grasping
But they said: "We (E), we found our fathers on a constitution (set example) , and We (E) on their tracks are guided
And as/like that We did not send from before you in a village/urban city from a warner/giver of notice except its luxuriated ungrateful and arrogant said: "We (E), we found our fathers on a constitution (set example) , and we (E), on their tracks , we are following/imitating (their) example
He (the messenger) said : "Even if I came to you with more guiding than what you found on it your fathers?" They said: "We (E) (are) with what you were sent with it (are) disbelievers
So We revenged from them, so see/wonder about how was the liars`/deniers` end/turn (result)
And when Abraham said to his father and his nation: "That I am innocent from what you worship
Except who created me/brought me into being , so that He truly will guide me
And he made it a word/expression , remaining/lasting in his sons/descendants , maybe/perhaps they return
But I gave those a long life/made those enjoy, and their fathers, until the truth and a clear/evident messenger came to them
And when the truth came to them, they said: "That (is) magic/sorcery, and we are with it disbelieving
And they said: "If only this the Koran was descended on a great man from the two villages/urban cities
Are they apportioning/dividing/making fate (of) your Lord`s mercy, We (E) apportioned/divided/fated between them their livelihood in the life the present/worldly life, and We raised some of them over/above some steps/stages/degrees, for some to take some of them making fun/ridiculing , and your Lord`s mercy (is) better than what they gather/collect
Were it not for that the people be one nation We would have made to who disbelieves with the merciful, for their houses/homes roofs/ceilings from silver and stairs/lifts on it they mount/ascend
And for their houses doors/entrances and beds/sofas, on it they lean/recline on
And ornament/decoration , and that (E) all (of) that (is) accumulatively/collectively the life the present`s/worldly life`s long life/enjoyment, and the end (other life) at your Lord (is) to the fearing and obeying
And who ignores about the merciful`s reminder, We predestine/lead/assign for him a devil, so he is for him a companion/friend
And that they truly, they prevent/obstruct them (E) from the way/path , and they think/suppose that they are guided
Until if he came to Us, he said: "Oh if only between me and between you (are) the two sun rises`/easts` far distances, so how bad (is) the companion
(It) will never/not benefit you today/the day if you caused injustice/oppressed, that you are in the torture sharing
So do you make the deaf hear/listen, or guide the blind/confused , and who was in a clear/evident misguidance
So when We go away with you (We make you die), so We are from them revenging/punishing
Or We show you/make you understand what We promised them, so We are on them, We are capable/over powering
So hold fast/grasp with what was inspired/transmitted to you, that you are on a straight/direct road/way
And that it truly is a remembrance/reminder to you and to your nation, and you will/shall be asked/questioned
And ask/question whom We sent from before you from Our messengers, did We make/create from other than the merciful gods (that) they are being worshipped
And We had sent Moses with Our signs/evidences to Pharaoh and his nobles/group/assembly, so he (Moses) said: "That I am messenger (of) the creations all together`s/ (universes`) Lord
So when he came to them with Our evidences/signs , then they are from it laughing
And We do not show them/make them understand from a verse/evidence/sign except (that) it is greater than its sister, and We took/punished them with the torture, maybe/perhaps they return
And they said: "You, you the magician/sorcerer, call for us your Lord with what He promised at you, that we truly are guided (E)
So when We removed/uncovered from them the torture, then they are breaking/breaching/violating
And Pharaoh called in his nation, he said: "You my nation, is not for me ownership/kingdom (of) Egypt/(the) region , and these the rivers flow/run from beneath/below me, so do you not see/ understand
Or I am better than that which He is (Moses) humiliated and nor, is (he) about to clarify/show/explain
So if only bracelets from gold were thrown on him, or the angels came with him accompanying/joining
So he misled/fooled his nation, so they obeyed him, that they truly were a nation (of) debauchers/dissoluters
So when they made Us angry/sad , We revenged from/punished them, so We drowned/sunk them all/all together
So We made them an advance/past (precedent), and an example/proverb to the ends/lasts/others
And when Mary`s son was given (as) an example , then your nation from Him, they object/obstruct
And they said: "Are our gods better or He?" They did not give it (the question) to you except arguing/disputing (E), but they are a nation disputing/controverting
That truly he (Jesus) is except a worshipper/slave We blessed on him and We made him an example to Israel`s sons and daughters
And if We will/want, We would have made from you angels in the earth/Planet Earth they succeed/follow
And that he/it truly is knowledge (E) to the Resurrection/Time of Resurrection/Hour, so do not doubt/argue (E) with it, and follow Me, that (is a) straight/direct road/way
And (let) not the devil prevent/obstruct you, that he truly is for you a clear/evident enemy
And when Jesus came with the evidences, he said: "I had come to you with the wisdom, and to clarify/explain for you some/part (of) what you differ/disagree in it, so fear and obey God, and obey me
That truly God He is my Lord and your Lord so worship Him, that (is) a straight/direct way/road
So the group/parties differed/disagreed from between them, so calamity/scandal to those who caused injustice/oppression from a day`s/time`s painful torture
Do they look/watch/wonder about except that the Hour/Resurrection comes to them suddenly/unexpectedly and they do not feel/know/sense
That day, the faithful close friends some of them to some (to each other are) an enemy, except the fearing and obeying
You My worshippers , (there is) no fear/fright on you the day/today, and nor you be sad/grieving
Those who believed with Our verses/evidences and they were Moslems/submitters/surrenders
Enter the Paradise you and your spouses , you rejoice/delight
Being circled/walked around on them with platters/plates/bowls from gold and cups , and in it what the selves lust/desire/crave it, and delights/pleasures the eyes/sights, and you are in it immortally/eternally
And that (is) the Paradise which you were made to inherit it, because (of) what you were making/doing
For you in it many/much fruits, from it you eat
That truly the criminals/sinners (are) in Hell`s torture immortally/eternally
(It is) not to be weakened/subsided on them, and they are in it confused/dumbfounded
And We did not cause injustice/oppression to them, and but they, they were the unjust/oppressive
And they called: "You Malek , (let) your Lord to end/destroy on us." He said: "That you are waiting/remaining (in it)
We had (E) come to you with the truth , and but most of you to the truth (are) hating
Or they conspired and determined a matter/affair , so We are conspiring and determining
Or they think/suppose that We do not hear/listen (to) their secret and their confidential talk , yes/certainly, and Our messengers (are) at/by them writing/dictating
Say: "If (there) was to the merciful a child (son), so I am the worshippers` first/beginner
Praise/glory (to) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s Lord, the throne`s Lord, from/about what they describe/categorize
So leave them plunge into/engage in conversation (their wishful interpretation of the scriptures) and play/amuse , until they meet/find their day/time which they are being promised
And He is who (is) in the skies/space a God, and in the earth/Planet Earth a God, and He is the wise/judicious, the knowledgeable
And blessed who for Him (is) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s and what (is) between them (B)`s ownership/kingdom , and at Him (is) the Hour`s/Resurrection`s knowledge, and to Him you are being returned
And those whom they call from other than Him, do not own/possess the mediation, except who testified/witnessed with the truth and they are knowing
And if (E) you asked/questioned them: "Who created them?" They will say (E): "God." So where/how they be lied to/turned away
And his saying/word: "You my lord, that truly those (are) a nation not believing
So turn away/disregard from them, and say: "A greeting/safety/security/peace." So they will know
H M
And The Book , the clear/evident
That We, We descended it in a blessed night, that We, We were warners/givers of notice
In it every/each wise/judicious matter/affair is separated
A matter/affair/order/command from at Us, that We were senders/sending
Mercy from your Lord that He truly is the hearing/listening, the knowledgeable
The skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s Lord and what (is) between them (B), if you were sure/certain
(There is) no God except Him, He revives/makes alive, and He makes die, your Lord and your fathers`/forefathers`, the first`s/beginners` Lord
But they are in doubt/suspicion playing/amusing
So observe/lie in wait, a day/time the sky/space comes with clear/evident smoke/fumes
It covers/afflicts the people, that is a painful torture
(They say): "Our Lord remove/uncover (relieve) from us the torture, that we are believing
From where/how the remembrance/reminder be for them, and a clear/evident messenger had come to them
Then they turned away from Him and they said: "Taught/instructed/informed, mad/insane
That We (are) removing/uncovering (relieving) the torture little, that you truly are returning
A day/time We violently destroy the violent attack , the greatest/biggest , that We truly are revenging/punishing
And We had tested/allured Pharaoh`s nation before them, and an honoured/generous messenger came to them
That (E) discharge/fulfill (give/pay) to me God`s worshippers/slaves , that I am for you a faithful/loyal messenger
And that (E) do not become high, mighty and dignified on God, that I am coming to you with a clear/evident proof/evidence
And that I, I seeked protection with my Lord and your Lord, that (E) you stone me
And if you do not believe to me, so separate/isolate yourselves from me
So he called his Lord: "That (E) those (are) a nation (of) criminals/sinners
So you go/move with My worshippers/slaves at night, that you are being followed
And leave the sea/ocean strolling/walking slowly , that they truly are drowning/sinking soldiers/warriors
How many/much they left (behind) from treed gardens and water springs/wells
And plants/crops and an honoured/generous position/status
And blessing/goodness they were in it joyful (eating fruit)
Like that, and We made it be inherited (by) a nation (of) others
So the sky/space and the earth/Planet Earth did not weep (sadden) on them, and they were not given time/delayed
And We had saved/rescued Israel`s sons and daughters from the torture the humiliating/disgracing
From Pharaoh, that he truly was high and mighty from the wasters/extravagators
And We had chosen them on knowledge over the creations all together/(universes)
And We gave/brought them from the verses/evidences what is in it a clear/evident test
That truly those say (E)
That truly it is except our death/lifelessness the first/beginning, and we are not with being revived/resurrected
So come with our fathers/forefathers if you were truthful
Are they better or a nation of Tuba (could be from Yemen)/shade and those from before them? We made them die/destroyed them , that they truly were criminals/sinners
And We did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) playing/amusing
We did not create them (B) except with the truth , and but most of them do not know
That truly the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day (is) their appointed time all/all together
A day/time (a) master/ally does not enrich/suffice (replace) from (a) master/ally a thing, and nor they be given victory/aid
Except whom God had mercy upon (him), that He truly, He is the glorious/mighty , the merciful
That truly the deadly food`s tree
(Is) the sinner`s/criminal`s food/feeding
As/like the dead`s pus/melted metals , (it) boils in the bellies/insides
As the hot water`s/red hot coal`s boiling
Take/punish him so pull or drag him violently to the Hell`s middle
Then pour from above his head the hot water`s/red hot coal`s torture
Taste/experience, that you are, you are the glorious/mighty , the honored/generous
That truly that (is) what you were with it doubting/arguing
That truly the fearing and obeying (are) in a secure/safe position/status
In treed gardens/paradises and water springs/wells
They dress from sarcenet (a certain type of silk or brocade), and brocade (silk and gold fabric), facing each other
As/like that, and We got them married with (spouses of) eyes with intense blackness of pupils and whiteness (beautifully contrasted)
They call in it with all fruits safe/secure
They do not taste/experience in it the death/lifelessness except the first death, and He protected them (from) the Hell`s torture
Grace/favour from you Lord, that (is) the success/triumph , the great
So We eased it/We made it flexible with your tongue/language, maybe/perhaps they mention/remember
So observe/lie in wait , that they truly are observing/being made to observe
H M
The Book`s descent from God, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious
That truly in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth (are) evidences/signs (E) to the believers
And in your creation, and what He scatters/distributes from a walker/creeper/crawler (are) evidences/signs to a nation being sure/certain
And (the) difference (of) the night and the daytime, and what God descended from the sky/space from (a) provision , so He revived with it the Earth/land after its death/lifelessness, and diverting/pushing the winds/breezes (are) evidences/signs to a nation reasoning/comprehending
Those are God`s evidences/signs/verses, We read/recite it on (to) you with the truth . With which information/speech after God and His verses/evidences/signs (do) they believe
Calamity/scandal/grief to every/each liar/falsifier, sinner/criminal
He hears/listens (to) God`s evidences/verses being read/recited on (to) him, then he persists/insists arrogantly as though he did not hear/listen (to) it, so announce good news to him with a painful torture
And if he knew a thing from Our evidences/verses he took it mockingly/making fun, those for them (is) a humiliating/disgracing torture
From behind/beyond them (is) Hell , and it does not enrich/suffice from them a thing (from) what they gained/acquired , and nor what they took from other than God (as) guardians/allies , and for them (is) a great torture
That (is) guidance, and those who disbelieved with their Lord`s verses/evidences , for them (is) a torture from painful filth/torture
God (is) who manipulated/subjugated for you the sea/ocean for the ship/ships (to) flow/run in it with His order/command, and (for) you to wish/desire from His grace/favour , and maybe/perhaps you thank/be grateful
And He manipulated/subjugated for you what (is) in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth all/all together from Him, that truly in that (are) evidences/signs (E) to a nation thinking
Say to those who believed: "Forgive to those who do not hope/expect God`s days/times, (it is to Him) to reimburse a nation because (of) what they were gaining/acquiring
Who made/did correct/righteous deeds, so (it is) for himself, and who did bad/evil/harm so on (for) it, then to your Lord you are being returned
And We had (E) given/brought to Israel`s sons and daughters The Book , and the judgment/rule, and the prophethood, and We provided for them from the goodnesses , and We preferred/favoured them over the creations all together/(universes)
And We gave/brought them evidences from the matter/affair/order/command, so they did not differ/disagree/dispute except from after what came to them (from) the knowledge, oppression/transgression between them, that truly your Lord passes judgment/ends between them (on) the Resurrection Day in what they were in it differing/disagreeing
Then We made/put you on God`s decreed way of life from the order/command so follow it, and do not follow (the) self attractions for desires (of) those who do not know
That they truly will never/not enrich/avail (help) from you from God a thing, and that truly the unjust/oppressive some of them (are) guardians/allies (of) some, and God (is) guardian/ally (of) the fearing and obeying
That (is) mental perceptions/evidences to the people, and guidance, and mercy to a nation being sure/certain
Or (did) those who earned/committed the sins/crimes think/suppose that (E) We make/put them as those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, equal/alike (in) their life and (in) their death/time of death? It is bad what they judge/rule
And God created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth with the truth , and each/every self (is) to be reimbursed because (of) what it gained/acquired , and they are not being caused injustice to/oppressed
Did you see/understand who took (idolized) his self attraction for desire (as) his god? And God misguided him on knowledge, and He sealed/stamped on his hearing/listening/sense of hearing and His heart/mind ,and He made/put on his eye sight/understanding a cover, so who guides him from after God? So do you not mention/remember
And they said: "It is not except our life the present/worldly life, we die and we live, and nothing makes us die/destroys us except the long time." And (there is) no knowledge with that for them, that truly they are except assuming/supposing
And if Our evidences/signs/verses are read/recited on (to) them, their argument was not except that (E) they said: "Come/bring with our fathers/forefathers if you were truthful
Say: "God revives/makes you alive, then He makes you die, then He gathers/collects you to the Resurrection Day, no doubt/suspicion in it, and but most of the people do not know
And to God (are) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s ownership/possession , and a day/time the Hour/Resurrection starts , that day, the wasters/annulers loose
And you see every/each nation kneeling/sitting on (its) knees , every/each nation is being called to its Book , (and told): "The day/today you are being reimbursed (for) what you were making/doing
That (is) Our Book (it) speaks/clarifies on (to) you with the truth , that We, We were transcribing/duplicating/printing what you were making/doing
So but those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so their Lord enters them in His mercy, that it is the winning/success , the clear/evident
And but those who disbelieved (were told): "Were not My evidences/verses being read/recited on (to) you, so you became arrogant, and you were a nation (of) criminals/sinners
And if (it) was said: "That truly God`s promise (is) truth , and the Hour/Resurrection (there is) no doubt/suspicion in it." You said: "We do not know what (is) the Hour/Resurrection , that we assume/suppose except thought/assumption , and we (are) not with being sure/certain
And it appeared to them sins/crimes (of) what they made/did , and what they were with it mocking/making fun (of) surrounded/encircled with them
And (it) was said: "The day/today We forget you, as/like you forgot meeting this, your day/time, and your shelter/refuge (is) the fire , and (there are) no victoriors/saviors for you
That (is) with that you, you took/received God`s verses/evidences mockingly/making fun, and the life the present/worldly life has deceived/tempted you. So the day/today they are not brought/driven out from it, and nor they be allowed to offer reconciliation
So to God (is) the praise/gratitude/thanks, the skies`/space`s Lord and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s Lord, the creations all together`s/(universe`s) Lord
And for Him (is) the arrogance/greatness in the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and He is the glorious/mighty, the wise/judicious
H M
The Book`s descent from God, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious
We did not create the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth and what (is) between them (B) except with the truth , and a named/identified (specified) term/time, and those who disbelieved (are) objecting/opposing from what they were warned/given notice (of)
Say: "Did you see what you call from other than God? Show me what they created from the earth/Planet Earth, or for them (is) a partnership in the skies/space? Come/bring to me with a Book from before this, or a mark/historical remain from knowledge, if you were truthful
And who (is) more misguided than who calls from other than God whom does not answer/reply to him to the Resurrection Day, and they are from their call/request/prayer ignoring/disregarding
And if the people were gathered, they (their gods) were enemies for them, and they were with their worshipping disbelieving (disowning)
And if Our evidences/signs/verses are read/recited on them, those who disbelieved to the truth when it came to them said: "This (is) clear/evident magic/sorcery
Or they say: "He fabricated/cut and split it." Say: "If I fabricated/cut and split it, so you do not own/possess for me from God a thing. He is more knowledgeable with what you rush/hurry in it, enough/sufficient with Him (as) a witness/testifier between me and between you, and He is the forgiving, the merciful
Say: "I was not (a) new invention/unprecedented from the messengers, and I do not know what will be made/done with me, nor with you, that I follow except what is being inspired/transmitted to me, and I am not except a clear/evident warner/giver of notice
Say: "Did you see if (it) was from at God, and you disbelieved with (in) it, and a witness/testifier from Israel`s sons and daughters witnessed/testified on similar/alike to it (Old Testament), so he believed and you became arrogant? That truly God does not guide the nation the unjust/oppressive
And those who disbelieved said to those who believed: "If (it) was good , they would not have preceded us to it." And if they not be guided with it, so they will say: "That (is) old lies/falsehood
And from before it (is) Moses` Book , a leader/example , and mercy, and that (is a) confirming Book (in an) Arabic tongue/speech, to warn/give notice (to) those who caused injustice/ oppression, and good news to the good doers
That truly those who said: "Our Lord (is) God" then they became straight/direct, so no fear/fright on them, and nor they be sad/grieving
Those are the Paradise`s friends/company (they are) immortally/eternally in it, a reward/reimbursement because (of) what they were making/doing
And We directed/commanded the human (with) a goodness (in treatment) with (to) his parents, his mother bore/became pregnant with him compellingly/forcefully/involuntarily and she gave birth to him compellingly/forcefully/involuntarily, and his weight/pregnancy with him , and his wearing/separation thirty months, until when he reached his maturity/strength, and he reached forty years, he said: "My Lord inspire/influence me that (E) I thank/be grateful (for) your blessing which you blessed on me and on my parents, and that (E) I make/do correct/righteous deeds you accept/approve it, and correct/repair for me in my descendants, that I repented to you, and that I am from the Moslems/submitters/surrenderers
Those are those whom We accept (the) best (of) what they made/did , and We overlook/forgive from their sins/crimes in the Paradises` friends/company , the truth`s promise which they were being promised
And who said to his parents: "Ugh to you (B) do you (B) promise me that (E) I will be brought out, and the generations/centuries had past/expired from before me?" And they (B), they (B) seek/ask for help (from) God: "Your calamity/scandal/woe believe, that truly God`s promise (is) truth ." So he says: "That (is) not except the first`s/beginner`s myths/baseless stories
Those are those who the word/opinion and belief became correct/true in nations (that) had passed/expired from before them from the Jinns and the human/mankind, that they truly were losers
And to each, steps/degrees from what they made/did , and to fulfill/complete (to) them their deeds, and they not be caused injustice to/oppressed
And a day/time those who disbelieved be displayed/exhibited on (to) the fire : "You wiped off/eliminated your good (deeds) in your life the present/worldly life, and you lived long/enjoyed with it, so the day/today you are being reimbursed (the) torture (of) the humiliation/disgrace because (of) what you were being arrogant in the earth/Planet Earth without the right , and because (of) what you were debauching
And remember Aad`s brother when He warned/gave notice (to) his nation by the long winding sand (patterns/dunes), and the warnings/notices had past/expired from between his hands and from behind him (the warnings were given before and during his time): "That you not worship except God, that I, I fear on (for) you a great day`s/time`s torture
They said: "Did you come to us to turn us away from our gods, so come/bring to us with what you promise us if you were from the truthful
He said: "But/truly the knowledge (is) at God, and I communicate/inform you what I was sent with it, and but I see you (as) a nation being lowly/ignorant
So when they saw/understood it an obstructing cloud approaching/coming (to) their valleys, they said: "That obstructing cloud (is) raining on us." No/rather it is what you hurried/hastened with it, a wind/smell in it (is) a painful torture
It destroys every thing with its Lord`s order/command, so they became/became in the morning not (to) be seen except their residences, as/like that We reimburse the nation, the criminals/sinners
And We had (E) highly positioned/strengthened them in what We have not highly positioned/strengthened you in it, and We made/put for them a sense of hearing , and eye sights, and hearts , so their sense of hearing , and nor their eye sights, and nor their hearts did not enrich/suffice from them a thing when they were disbelieving and denying with God`s evidences/verses ; and what they were with it mocking/making fun of surrounded/encircled with them
And We had (E) destroyed what (is) around/surrounding you from the villages/urban cities, and We detailed/elaborated linguistically the evidences/verses , maybe/perhaps they return
So if only those whom they took (as) an approachment to God, gods from other than God gave them victory/aid (if only their gods that they worship other than God would give them victory), but they misguided from them, and that (is) their lies/falsehood, and what they were fabricating/cutting and splitting
And when We diverted/returned/pushed to you a group (from 3-10)/family/tribe from the Jinns, they hear/listen (to) the Koran , so when they attended/came to it, they said: "Listen quietly." So when it ended (the Koran in entirety), they turned away to their nation warning/giving notice/warners/givers of notice
They said: "You our nation that we heard/listened to a Book (that) was descended from after Moses, confirming to what (is) between his hands, it guides to the truth and to (a) straight/direct road/path
You our nation, answer/reply God`s caller/requester, and believe with Him, He forgives for you from your crimes and He protects/defends you from a painful torture
And who does not answer/reply (to) God`s caller/requester so (he is) not with disabling/frustrating in the land/planet Earth , and (there) is not from other than Him guardians/allies , those are in clear/evident misguidance
Did they not see/understand that (E) God (is) who created the skies/space and the earth/Planet Earth, and (He) did not fail/fatigue with their creation, (is) with capable/able on that He revives/makes alive the deads, yes/certainly, that He truly is on every thing capable/able
And a day/time those who disbelieved be displayed/exhibited on (to) the fire (and told): "Is this not with the truth ?" They said: "Yes/certainly and by , our Lord." He said: "So taste/experience the torture because (of) what you were disbelieving
So be patient as/like (owners) of the decisiveness/determination from the messengers became patient, and do not hurry/hasten for them, a day/time they see/understand what they are being promised (it is) as if they did not stay/remain/wait except an hour from daytime, (this is) information/communication, so do (any) except the nation the debauchers be made to die/be destroyed
Those who disbelieved and prevented/obstructed from God`s way/path He misguided their deeds
And those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and believed with what was descended on Mohammad, and it is the truth from their Lord, He covered/substituted from them their sins/crimes, and He corrected/repaired their mind/thought/condition
That (is) with that those who disbelieved followed the falsehood, and that (E) those who believed followed the truth from their Lord, as/like that God gives to the people their examples
So if you met/found those who disbelieved, so hitting the necks until when you weakened them , so strengthen the rope/tie/chain (confinement), so either/or blessing (releasing war prisoners) after (the war ends), and either ransom/compensation until the battle/war/fight drops its weights/burdens (ends), that and if God wants/wills He would have gotten victory from them, and but to test some of you with some (to test each other), and those who were killed in God`s way/path , so He will never/not misguide their deeds
He will guide them, and He corrects/repairs their mind/thought/condition
And He enters them (to) the Paradise (which) He made it known to them
You, you those who believed, if you give God victory/aid, He gives you victory/aid, and He affirms/strengthens your feet
And those who disbelieved, so destruction/harm (is) for them, and He misguided their deeds
That (is) with that they hated what God descended, so He wasted/invalidated their deeds
Do they not walk/move/ride in the earth/Planet Earth so they see/wonder about how was those from before them`s end/turn (result)? God destroyed on them and to the disbelievers similar/alike to it
That (is) with that God (is) those who believed`s guardian/ally , and that (E) the disbelievers (have) no guardian/ally for them
That truly God enters those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds treed gardens the rivers flow/run from beneath it, and those who disbelieved live long/enjoy and eat as/like the camels/livestock eat, and the fire (is a) home/dwelling for them
And how many from a village/urban city it is stronger (in) strength/power than your village/urban city which brought/drove you out? We destroyed them , so (there is) no victorior/savior for them
Is who was on an evidence from his Lord as/like (who) his deed`s evil/harm was decorated/beautified for him, and they followed their self attractions for desires
The Paradise`sexample which the fearing and obeying were promised in it, (is) rivers from water not stagnant , and rivers from milk, its taste did not change, and rivers from wine/all intoxicants, (it is a) delight/pleasure to the drinking , and rivers from purified/strained honey/molasses , and for them in it (are) from all the fruits, and forgiveness from their Lord, as/like who he is immortal/eternal in the fire , and they were made to drink hot/cold water , so it cut off/severed their intestines/guts
And from them who hears/listens to you until when they got out/emerged (left) from at you, they said to those who were given/brought the knowledge: "What (did) he say previously/from a short while ?"Those are, those who God stamped/sealed on their hearts/minds , and they followed their self attractions for desires
And those who guided, He increased them guidance, and He gave them their fear and obedience of God
So do they wait/watch except (for) the Hour/Resurrection that (E) it comes to them suddenly/unexpectedly, so its signs/indications had (E) come, so how (is it) for them if/when their reminder/remembrance came to them
So know that it is no god except God (there is no God except the one God)? And ask for forgiveness for your crime, and to the believers (M) and the believers (F), and God knows your turning around/over and your residence/dwelling
And those who believed said: "If only a chapter of the Koran was descended." So if a perfected/confirmed chapter of the Koran was descended and the fighting was mentioned in it, you saw those whom in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease (doubt) looking to you, (the) vision/sight (of) the unconscious on him from the death/lifelessness (the sight of one afraid of death), so (a) warning/threat (so Hell) to them
Obedience and a generous word/opinion and belief , so if the matter/affair (was) determined/decided , so if they were truthful (to) God (it) would have been better for them
So did you maybe/perhaps (hope) if you turned away that (E) you corrupt/disorder in the earth/Planet Earth and cut off/sever your relations/wombs/uteruses? (Did you expect to get away with it)
Those are those who God cursed/humiliated them , so He made them deaf and (He) blinded/confused their eye sights/understanding
So do they not consider/deliberate the Koran, or on hearts/minds its locks/closures
That truly those who returned on their backs/ends from after what was clarified for them (from) the guidance, the devil enticed/lured for them, and extended in time for them
That is with that they said to those who hated what God descended: "We will obey you in some (of) the matter/affair." And God knows their secrets
So how (is it) if the angels made them die, they strike/hit their faces and their backs/ends
That (is) with that they followed what angered/dissatisfied God, and they hated His acceptance/satisfaction , so He wasted/invalidated their deeds
Or did those whom in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease (doubt) think/suppose that (E) God will never/not bring out their hatred/grudge
And if We will/want, We would have shown them to you, so you would have known them by their marks/identifications/expressions, and you will know them in the word`s/opinion and belief`s or grammatical mistakes/intonement , and God knows your deeds
And We will test you until We know the struggling/defending for the faith from you, and the patient, and We test/ justify your news/information/knowledge
That truly those who disbelieved and prevented/obstructed from God`s way/path and they defied/disobeyed the messenger from after what was clarified for them (from) the guidance, they will never/not harm God (in) a thing, and He will invalidate/waste their deeds
You, you those who believed, obey God and obey the messenger and do not waste/annul your deeds
That truly those who disbelieved and prevented/obstructed from God`s way/path then they died and (while) they are disbelievers, so God will never/not forgive for them
So do not weaken/enfeeble and call to the peace and (while) you are the defeating , and God (is) with you, and He will never/not reduce your deeds
But/truly the life the present/worldly life is playing/amusement and fun/games (attractions), and if you believe and fear and obey, He gives/brings you your rewards , and He does not ask/question you (for) your properties/possessions
If He demands/asks you for it , so He asks you persistently , (so) you be stingy/miser and He brings out your hatred/grudge
Here you are those (who) are being called to spend in God`s way/path , so from you who is stingy/ miser; and who is stingy/miser so but (he) is stingy/miser on (against) himself, and God (is) the rich, and you are the poor/needy/deprived , and if you turn away He exchanges/replaces a nation other than you, then they do not be similar/alike to you
We (E) opened/disclosed for you a clear/evident opening/victory

And He tortures the hypocrites (M) and the hypocrites (F), and the sharers/takers of partners with God (M) and the sharers/takers of partners with God (F), the thinkers/assumers with (of) God the bad`s/evil`s thought/assumption , on them (is) the bad`s/evil`s circle/disaster, and God became angry/angered on them, and He cursed/humiliated them , and He prepared for them Hell , and it was a bad/evil end/destination

Where it not for that (E) God wrote/decreed the departure/moving out on them, He would have tortured them in the present world, and for them in the end (other life is) the fire`s torture

What you cut off from a palm , or you left it standing on its roots , so (it is) with God`s permission/pardon, and to reimburse the debauchers
And what God bestowed upon/gave spoils of war on His messenger from them, so you did not hurry/rush on him from horses, and nor camels ridden or loaded/riders , and but God empowers His messengers on whom He wills/wants , and God is on every thing capable. (Whatever God gave His messenger is not from your support but through God`s blessing)
What God bestowed upon/gave spoils of war on His messenger from the villages`/urban cities` people , so (it is) to God and the messenger, and to of the relations/near, and the orphans , and the poorest of poor/poor oppressed, and the traveler/stranded traveler, in order that (it) not be a rotation/alternation between the rich from you, and what the messenger gave you , so take/receive it , and what he forbid/prevented you from it, so terminate/stop , and fear and obey God, so that truly God (is) strong (severe in) the punishment

And those who resided/settled the house/home and the faith/belief from before them, they love/like who emigrated to them, and they do not find in their chests (innermosts) a need/necessity from what they were given/brought, and they prefer/choose (the immigrants) over themselves and even if (it) was neediness/poverty with them, and who is protected (from) his self`, so those are the successful/winners
And those who came from after them, they say: "Our Lord forgive for us, and to our brothers, those who preceded us with (to) the faith/belief, and do not make/put in our hearts/minds hatred/animosity to those who believed, our Lord, that you are merciful/compassionate, merciful
Did you not see to those who exercised hypocrisy, they say to their brothers those who disbelieved from The Books` people: "If (E) you were brought out, we will go out (E) with you. And we do not obey anyone in (from) you ever (E), and if you were fought/killed, We will give you victory/aid (E)." And God witnesses/testifies that they truly are liars/deniers/falsifiers (E)
If (E) they were brought/driven out, they do not get out with them, and if (E) they were fought/killed, they do not give them victory/aid, and if (E) they gave them victory/aid, they will turn away (E) (on) the backs/ends, then, they do not be given victory/aid
You are (E) stronger terror/fright in their chests (innermosts) than God, that (is) with that they (are) a nation not understanding/knowing
They do not fight/kill you all/all together, except in fortified/protected villages/urban cities, or from behind walls, their courage/power between them (is) strong (severe), you think/suppose them (to be) all/all together, and their hearts/minds (are) separate/different , that (is) with that they are a nation not reasoning/comprehending
As/like (the) example/proverb, (of) those from before them near/close (shortly), they tasted/experienced their matters`/affair`s severity/bad consequences , and for them (is) a painful torture
As/like (the) example/proverb (of) the devil, when he said to the human/mankind: "Disbelieve." So when he (the human) disbelieved, he said: "I am innocent/renouncing from you, that I, I fear God, the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord

Your relations and nor your children will never/not benefit you (on) the Resurrection Day, He separates/judges/decides between you, and God (is) with what you make/do seeing/knowing
A good example/model (to follow) had been for you in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their nation: "We are innocent/separating from you, and from what you worship from other than God, we disbelieved with you, and the animosity and the intense hatred appeared between us and between you (for) ever (E), until you believe with (in) God alone." Except Abraham`s word/statement to his father: "I will ask for forgiveness for you, and I do not own/possess for you from God from a thing, our Lord, on You we relied depended (on) , and to You we returned/repented , and to You (is) the end/destination
Our Lord do not make/put us (as) a test/allurement to those who disbelieved, and forgive for us, our Lord, that You truly are, You are, the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious
A good example/model (to follow) had been for you in them, to who was hoping/expecting God, and the Day the Last/Resurrection Day; and who turns away, so then God, He is the rich, the praiseworthy/commendable

You, you those who believed, if the believing females came to you emigrating , so test/examine them (F) , God (is) more knowing with their faith/belief, so if you knew them (F) (to be) believers (F), so do not return them to the disbelievers, they (F) are not permitted/allowed for them, and nor they (the disbelievers) be permitted/allowed for them (F), and give them what they spent, and (there is) no offense/sin that (E) youmarry them (F) if you gave them (F) their rewards (dowries) , and do not hold fast/grasp/seize with the (insisting) disbelievers` ties/bonds (discontinue marriage to disbelieving women), and ask (for) what you spent, and they should ask (for) what they spent, that (is) God`s judgment/rule, He judges/rules between you, and God (is) knowledgeable, wise/judicious
And if a thing passed you from your spouses to the disbelievers, (so if you lost some of your possessions to disbelieving wives that left you) so you punished , so bring those whom their spouses went/took away (reimburse spouses of disbelievers) similar/equal (to) what they spent, and fear and obey God, whom you are with (in) Him believing
You, you the prophet, if the believers (F) came to you, they (F) pledge/swear to you loyalty on that (E) they (F) not share/make partners with God a thing, and nor they (F) steal/rob, and nor they (F) commit adultery/fornication , and nor they (F) kill their (F) children, and nor they (F) do/commit with falsehood/slander (that) they (F) fabricate it between their (F) hands and their (F) feet, and nor they (F) disobey you in known/generosity , so pledge/swear to them (F) loyalty, and ask for forgiveness (P) for them (F) (from) God, that truly God (is) forgiving, merciful

That truly God loves/likes those who fight in His way/path (in) a row/line as if they are (a) sticking together and (a) well arranged building/structure
And when Moses said to his nation: "You my nation, why/for what (do) you harm mildly/harm me, and you have known that I am God`s messenger to you?" So when they deviated/turned away, God deviated/turned away their hearts/minds , and God does not guide the nation, the debauchers
And when Jesus Mary`s son said: "You Israel`s sons and daughters, that I am God`s messenger to you, confirming to what (is) between my hands from the Torah, and an announcer of good news with a messenger (that) comes from after me, his name (is) Ahmad ."

He is who sent His messenger with the guidance, and the truth`s religion, to make it visible/overcome on the religion all of it, and even if the sharers/takers of partners (with God) hated (it)
You, you those who believed, do I guide/lead you on (to) commercial trade/buying and selling (that) saves/rescues you from a painful torture
You believe with (in) God and His messenger, and you struggle/exert in God`s way/path with your possessions/wealths and your selves, that (is) best for you if you were knowing
He forgives for you your crimes, and He enters you treed gardens/paradises, the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, and good/beautiful residences in treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence, that (is) the winning/success , the great
And another (others) you love/like it, victory/aid from God and a near/close opening/victory , and announce good news (to) the believers
You, you those who believed, be God`s supporters , as/like Jesus Mary`s son said to the faithful and pure friends/deciples : "Who (are) my victoriors/supporters to God?" The faithful and pure friends/deciples said: "We are God`s victoriors/supporters ." So a group of people from Israel`s sons and daughters believed, and a group of people disbelieved, so We supported those who believed over their enemy, so they became conquering/defeating
What (is) in the skies/space and what (is) in the earth/Planet Earth praise/glorify to God, the king/owner/possessor, the Holy/Sanctimonious/Glorified , the glorious/mighty , the wise/judicious

You, you those who believed, if (it) was called to the prayers from the Friday`s/gathering`s day/time, so hasten/move quickly to God`s reminder/mention, and leave the selling/trading, that (is) best for you, if you were knowing
So if the prayers were accomplished/ended , so spread/spread out in the Earth/land , and ask/wish/desire from God`s grace/favour/blessing, and mention/remember/praise/ glorify God much, maybe/perhaps you succeed/win
And if they saw/understood commercial trade/buying and selling or play things/amusement , they scattered/separated to it, and they left you standing , say: "What (is) at God (is) better than the play things/amusement and from the commercial trade/buying and selling, and God (is) best (of) the providers

And if you saw them , their bodies pleases/marvels you, and if they say (talk), you hear/listen to their statement/word as if they are supported wood (logs), they think/suppose each/ every loud strong cry/torture raid is on (against) them, they are the enemy, so be warned/cautious (of) them , God fought them , (so) where/how (do) they be turned away
And when/if (it) was said to them: "Come, God`s messenger asks for forgiveness for you." They twisted/turned/ bent their heads, and you saw them preventing/obstructing , and they are arrogant
(It is) equal/alike on (for) them (if) you asked for forgiveness for them, or you did not ask for forgiveness for them, God will never/not forgive for them, that truly God does not guide the nation, the debauchers
They are those who say: "Do not spend on whom (is) at God`s messenger, until they scatter/separate And to God (are) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s safes/storages (treasures), and but the hypocrites do not understand/learn

Or did you become safe/secure (trust) whom (are) in the sky/space that (E) He sends on you a violent wind carrying pebbles and hail/hail laden clouds? So you will know how was My warning/notice
And those from before them had (E) lied/denied/falsified, so how was My severity (anger)
Do they not see to the birds above them expanded and motionless wings in a row, and they stretch and shrink/speed ? None holds/grasps them except the merciful, that He truly is with every thing seeing/understanding

Say: "He is who created/seeded you in the earth/Planet Earth and to Him you are being gathered
And they say: "When/at what time (is) that the promise if you were truthful
Say: "But/truly the knowledge (is) at God, and but/truly I am a clear/evident warner/giver of notice

Say: "Did you see if God punished/destroyed me and who (is) with me? Or had mercy upon us? So who protects/defends the disbelievers from a painful torture

Say: "Did you see/understand if your water became/became in the morning deeply sunk/bottomed ? So who comes/brings to you with water flowing easily and plentifully
N and the writing utensil/pen and what they write/inscribe/draft
you are not with your Lord`s blessing/goodness with mad/insane
And that truly for you (is) a reward (E) not interrupted/weakened (continuous)
And that you are on (E) great nature/character
So you will see/look/understand, and they (will) see/look/understand
With which of you (is) the insane
That truly your Lord He is more knowing with who misguided from His way/path , and He is more knowing with the guided
So do not obey the liars/deniers/falsifiers
They wished/desired if you grease/flatter with hypocrisy , so they grease/flatter with hypocrisy
And do not obey every/each habitual swearer despised/humiliated
Backbiter/urger , walking gossiper with slander/malice
Miser/often preventing to the good/generosity , transgressor/violator , sinner/criminal
Rough/rude , after that a known mean low or evil person
That (E) he was (owner) of property/wealth and sons and daughters

We will brand him by fire/mark him on the nose/trunk/snout (usually used for elephants)
We (E) tested them as/like We tested the treed garden`s owners/friends/company when they swore/made oath (that) they will cut it off (E) (will harvest it) by the morning/day break
And nor they exempt/make exception
So a circler/walker (twister/tornado) circled/walked on them, and (while) they are sleeping/quiet/ still
So it became/became in the morning as/like the harvested land/isolated sandy area
So they called each other in the morning/daybreak
That (E) go early on (to) your cultivation/plantation if you were cutting/shearing off (harvesting)
So they left/set out , and they are conversing quietly
That (E) no poor oppressed enters it (E) on you today/the day
And they went early on anger/prevention , capable/able
So when they saw it, they said: "That we are misguided (E)
But we are deprived
Their most honoured/moderate said: "Did I not say to you if only you praise/glorify
They said: "Our Lord`s praise/glory, we were unjust/oppressive
So some/part of them approached/came on (to) some (each other) blaming/reprimanding each other
They said: "Oh, our calamity , we (E), we were tyrannizing/arrogant
Maybe/perhaps that (E) our Lord exchanges/substitutes (for) us better than it, that we are to our Lord desiring/wishing
As/like that (is) the torture, and the end`s (other life`s) torture (E) (is) greater if they were knowing
That truly to the fearing and obeying at their Lord (are) the blessed treed gardens/paradises
Do We make the Moslems/submitters as the criminals/sinners
What/why (is it) for you, how you judge/rule
Or for you (is) a Book in it you study/read
That for you in it (is) what (E) you prefer choose
Or for you (are) rights/oaths on Us reaching to the Resurrection Day, that for you then (is) what (E) you judge/rule
Ask/question them which of them (is) with that a leader/grantor
Or for them (are) partners (with God)? So they should come with their partners (with God) if they were truthful
A day/time being uncovered/(relieved) of (a) shin/leg, and they be/are being called repeatedly to the prostration, so they are not able
Their eyesights/understanding (are) humble/submissive , humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses them , and they had become being called repeatedly to the prostration and they are safe/secure
So leave Me and who lies/denies/falsifies with this the information/speech, We will lead them gradually from where/when they do not know
And I extend for them in time/life , that truly My plotting/conspiring (is) solid/strong
Or (do) you ask/question them (for) a wage/fee so they are heavy/loaded/burdened from (a) burdensome debt
Or at them (is) the unseen/absent/(future) , so they are writing/dictating/ordering
So be patient for your Lord`s judgment/rule, and do not be as the large fish`s/whale`s owner/friend/company when he called/cried and he is held/quietened/suppressed
Had it not been for a blessing/goodness from his Lord, (that) caught up (to)/reached him , he would have been discarded/cast off at the open/space, and he is blamed/defamed
So his Lord chose/purified him, so He made him from the correct/righteous
And if those who disbelieved were about/almost to make you stumble/slip (E) with their eyesights when they heard/listened (to) the remembrance/reminder (the Koran), and they say: "That he truly is mad/insane (E)
And he/it is not except a reminder to the creations all together/(universes)
The disaster/catastrophe/reality
What is the disaster/catastrophe/reality
And what makes you know what (is) the disaster/catastrophe/reality
Thamud and Aad lied/denied/falsified with the Resurrection/disaster/calamity
So but (for) Thamud , so they were made to die/destroyed with a wind blowing/frosty (and) violent
And but (for) Aad , so they were made to die/destroyed by a violent blowing/frosty wind
He manipulated/subjugated it on them seven nights and eight days ominously/severing goodness (uprooting), so you see the nation in it lying flat/mad, as if they are palm tree`s fallen/destroyed ends
So do you see for them from a remainder/remnant
And Pharaoh came, and who (is) before him, and the overturned/destroyed cities with the sin
So they disobeyed their Lord`s messenger, so He punished them an increased spellbinding (devastating) punishment
We (E) when the water became elevated (over flowed)/violent , We carried/lifted you in the ship/flowing
To make/put it for you (as) a reminder, and comprehending/perceiving ears accept/understand it
So when (it) was blown in the horn/bugle/instrument, one blow
And the earth/Planet Earth and the mountains were carried/lifted , so they (B) were leveled/flattened one crunch/destruction
So that day, the Resurrection/Event landed/happened
And the sky/space split away/cut open , so it is (on) that day cracked/weak
And the angels (are) on its boundaries/vastness , and that day eight carries/lifts your Lord`s throne above them
That day, you are being exhibited/displayed , not a hidden (thing) hides from you
So but who was given/brought his book/judgment with his right (hand), so he says: "Take (here take this) read my Book/judgment
That I, I thought/assumed that I am receiving/meeting my account/calculation (punishment)
So he is in (an) acceptable/approved life/quality of life
In an elevated/dignified treed garden/paradise
Its fruit harvests (are) near
Eat and drink pleasurable/wholesome/tasty because (of) what you advanced in the days/times, the past/expired
And but who was given/brought his Book/judgment with his left (hand), so he says: "I wish I would have not been given my book/judgment
And I did not know what my account/calculation (is)
Oh,. if only it was the end/death
My property/possession/wealth did not enrich/suffice (help) from (for) me
My authority/power perished from me
Take/punish him , so chain/tie him
Then (in) the Hell roast/burn him
Then in a chain its measure (length is) seventy arm/ells/cubit , so enter/pass/thread/(tie) him
That he truly was not believing with (in) God, the great
And nor urges/insights/influences on feeding the poorest of poor/poor oppressed
So here, here (a) concerned (relative/friend) is not for him the day/today
And nor food except from ghesleen (could be Hell`s occupants` flesh, skin and blood)
None eat it except the mistaken/erroneous
So I do not swear/make oath with what you see
And what you do not see
That it truly is an honoured/noble messenger`s word/saying (E)
And it is not with a poet`s word/saying , little (is) what you believe
And nor with a fortune teller`s/altar priests word/saying , little (is) what you mention/remember
Descent from the creations all together`s/(universe`s) Lord
And if (the messenger) made false statements on Us (on Our behalf) some (of) the sayings/beliefs
We would have punished/taken from him by the right (hand)
Then We would have severed/cut off from him the aorta/heart`s main artery
So (there) is not from anyone from you preventing/hindering from (for) him
And that it truly is a reminder for the fearing and obeying
And We (E), We know (E) that (E) from you (are) liars/deniers/falsifiers
And that it truly is grief/sadness (E) , on the disbelievers
And that it truly is true/real (E) the assurance/certainty
So praise/glorify with your Lord`s name the great
(An) asker/questioner asked/questioned with (about) a falling/landing torture
To the disbelievers (there) is not for it (a) repeller/pusher
From God, (owner) of the methods of ascent
The angels and the Soul/Spirit ascend/climb to Him in a day/time its value/estimation/ measure was/is fifty thousand years
So be patient, beautiful/graceful patience
That they truly, they see/understand it a distant/far
And We see/understand it near/close
A day/time the sky/space becomes as the dead`s puss/melted metal
And the mountains become like the wool/dyed wool
And nor (a) concerned (relative/friend) asks/questions (about a) concerned (relative/friend)
They make them see/understand; the criminal/sinner wishes/loves if he ransoms/compensates (sacrifices) with his sons from that day`s torture (to save himself)
And his wife/companion/friend and his brother
And his closest tribe/relations which shelters him/gives him refuge
And whom (is) in the earth/Planet Earth all/all together, then (He) saves/rescues him
No, but that it is blazing/flaming
Pulling away/removing to the extremities/outer layer of skin
It calls who gave his back and turned away
And gathered/collected , so he comprehended/accepted
That truly the human/mankind was created worrisome/frightened
If the bad/evil/harm touched him, (he is) worrying/grievous and impatient
And if the goodness touched him, (he is) often preventing/prohibiting
Except the praying
Those who (are) on their prayers continuing/lasting
And those who in their properties/possessions (is) a known right/share
For the asker/beggar and the deprived
And those who believe/confirm with the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day
And those whom they are from their Lord`s torture, are afraid/guarding/cautious
That truly their Lord`s torture (is) not trusted/safe
And those who to their genital parts (they are) protecting/guarding
Except on (for) their spouses and what their rights owned/possessed (i.e.: care-givers of the sick, elderly and disabled under contract), so then they are not blameworthy/blamed
So who desired/wished beyond that, so those, they are the transgressors/violators
And those who, to their deposits/securities and their promise/contracts , (they are) protecting/observing
And those who, they are with their testimonies (they are) taking care of
And those who, they are on their prayers (they are) protecting/observing
Those are in treed gardens/paradises honoured
So why (is it) those who disbelieved (are) coming, rushing in fear towards/in front of you
Groups of people/relations from the right (side), and from the left (side)
Does every/each human from them wish/covet that (E) he enters a treed garden/paradise (of) comfort and ease
No but that We created them from what they know
So I do not swear/make oath with the sun rises`/easts` , and the sunsets`/wests` Lord, that We are capable/able (E)
On that (E) We exchange/replace better than them, and We are not with being raced/preceded
So leave them plunge into/engage in conversation and play/amuse until they meet/find their day/time which they are being promised
A day/time they appear/emerge from the graves quickening/rushing as if they are to monuments/slaughter places running/hurrying
Their eyesights/understanding (are) humble/submissive , humiliation/disgrace burdens/depresses them ,that (is) the day/time which they were being promised
That We sent Noah to his nation, that (E) warn/give notice (to) your nation from before that (E) a painful torture comes to them
He said: "My nation, that I am for you a clear/evident warner/giver of notice
That (E) worship God and fear and obey Him, and obey me
He forgives for you from your crimes, and He delays you to a named/identified (specified) term/time, that truly God`s term/time if (it) came (it) does not be delayed, if you were knowing
He said: "My Lord, that I , I called my nation at night/nightly and day time
So my call did not increase them except escape/fleeing
And that I, whenever I called them (for You) to forgive for them, they made/put their fingers in their ears, and they covered/darkened themselves (with) their clothes/garments , and they persisted/insisted, and they became arrogant, arrogantly
Then, that I, I called them publicly
Then, that I, I declared/publicized for them, and I confided for them secretly
So I said: `Ask for forgiveness (from) your Lord, that He truly was/is a forgiver/often, forgiving
He sends the sky/space on you flowing/pouring abundantly
And He extends/spreads you with properties/possessions , and sons and daughters, and He makes/puts for you treed gardens/paradises, and He makes/puts for you rivers/waterways
Why for you, you do not hope/expect for God a glory/respect
And He had created you (in) parallels/varieties/stages
Do you not see, understand how God created seven skies/space(s) (in) stages/layers/plates
And He made/put the moon in them (as) a light, and He made/put the sun (as) a lamp
And God sprouted/grew you from the earth/Planet Earth (as) plants/growth

And they cheated/deceived , a great/magnified cheatery/deceit
And they said: "Do not leave (E) your gods, and do not leave (E) Waddan (could be an idol god), and nor Sowa`an (a female idol god, worshipped by Hothail tribe of Arabs in pre-Islam), and nor Yaghootha (an idol god), and Yaooka (an idol god), and Nasran (an idol god)
And they had misguided many, and (my Lord), do not increase the unjust/oppressive except misguidance
From what their sins/wrongs they were drowned/sunken, so they were made to enter fire , so they did not find for them from other than God victoriors/saviors
And Noah said: "My Lord, do not leave on the earth/Planet Earth from the disbelievers a resident/inhabitant
That You, if You leave them, they misguide Your worshippers/servants , and they do not give birth except (to a) debaucher/corrupter, disbeliever
My Lord forgive for me and to my parents, and to who entered my house/home believing, and to the believers (M), and the believers (F), and do not increase the unjust/oppressive except destruction/ruin
Say: (It) was inspired/transmitted to me that it is a group (3 - 10) from the Jinn heard/ listened, so they said: `We (E) heard/listened (to) an astonishing/amazing/marvelous Koran
It guides to the correct/right guidance, so we believed with it, and we will never/not share/make partners with our Lord anyone
And that He truly is our Lord, high, mighty exalted and dignified (owner of) majestic greatness, (He) did not take a wife/companion/friend and nor a child/children
And that he, our ignorant/stupid/foolish was saying on (about) God excess of the limit
And that we, we thought/assumed that (E) the human/mankind and the Jinns will never/not say on (about) God lies/denials/falsifications

And that we, from us (are) the Moslems/submitters , and from us (are) the deviators/ hardened , so who submitted/surrendered , so those searched/pursued correct/right guidance
And but the deviators/hardened , so they were/are to/for Hell fire wood/fuel
And that if they became straight/direct on the way/path , we would have given them drink (from) water plentifully/abundantly
To test them in it, and who opposes/turns away from his Lord`s reminder , He enters/passes him a severe torture
And that (E) the mosques (are) to God, so do not call anyone with God
And that he when God`s worshipper/servant stood/started calling Him, they were about to/almost to be interlocked/plenty on (with) him

(It is for God) to know that (E) they had communicated/informed their Lord`s messages, and He surrounded/enveloped with what (is) at them, and He counted/controlled every thing numerous
You, you the hiding/wrapped in clothes
Stand the night except little
Its half/middle or reduce/decrease from it little
Or increase on it, and read or recite slowly, distinctly and clearly the Koran, slow distinct and clear reading or recitation

That We, We sent a messenger to you, a witness/testifier on you, as/like We sent a messenger to Pharaoh
So Pharaoh disobeyed the messenger, so We punished/took him (a) severe/detrimental punishing
So how (do) you fear and obey (avoid), if you disbelieved (in) a day it makes the children/new borns white or gray haired (old)
The sky/space is split/cleaved with (by) it, His promise was/is made/done
That truly this (is) a reminder, so who wanted took/received a way/path to his Lord
That truly your Lord knows that you, you stand/call (for) prayer nearer (than) from two-thirds (of) the night and its half/middle, and its third, and a group of people from those with you, and God predestines/evaluates the night and the daytime, He knew that you (will) not count/compute it so He forgave on you, so read what eased/became flexible (what you can) from the Koran, He knew that (E) sick/diseased will be from you, and others moving (traveling) in the land/Earth wishing/desiring from God`s grace/favour/blessing, and others fighting in God`s way/path , so read what eased/became flexible from it (what you can), and keep up the prayers, and give/bring the charity/purification, and lend/advance God a good/ beautifulloan/advance, and what you advance/produce for yourselves from goodness/ generosity you find it at God, it is better and greater (in) a reward , and ask God for forgiveness, that truly God (is) forgiving, merciful

And your clothes/garments , so purify/clean
And the paganism/idol worship/sin , so abandon
And do not do a favour and remind of it doing much (repeatedly)
And to your Lord, so be patient
So if the horn/bugle/trumpet was blown in
So that, that day (is) a difficult/distressing day/time
On the disbelievers (it is)not easy
Leave Me and whom I created alone
And I made/put for him extended/spread possessions/property
And sons and daughters present/testifying
And I prepared for him preparation
Then he wishes/covets that I increase
No, but he was to Our verses/evidences stubborn/obstinate
I will burden him (with) severity/hardship
That he truly thought, and he evaluated/estimated
So how he evaluated/estimated was killed (punished)
Then was killed (punished) how he evaluated/estimated
Then he looked
Then he frowned , and he frowned/became gloomy
Then he gave his back and he became arrogant
So he said: "That truly that (is) except magic/sorcery to be traced (followed/copied)
That truly that (is) except the human`s word/opinion and belief
I will roast/make him suffer Hell
And what makes you know what Hell (is)
(It) does not protect/have mercy , and nor it leaves
Shrinking/dehydrating due to fire to the human/skin
On it (are) nineteen
And We did not make the fire`s owners/company (guards) except angels, and We did not make their number/count except (as) a test to those who disbelieved, who were given/brought The Book (Jews and Christians) to be sure/certain, and (for) those who believed (to) increase faith/belief; and (for) those who weregiven The Book (Jews/Christians), and the believers do not become doubtful/suspicious, and (for) those whom in their hearts/minds (is) sickness/disease (doubt), and the disbelievers to say: "What (has) God wanted/intended with that (as) an example/proverb?" As/like that God misguides whom He wills/wants ,and He guides whom He wills/wants, and none know your Lord`s soldiers/warriors except Him, and it is not except a reminder to the human
No but and/by the moon
And/by the night when it ended/passed
And/by morning/day break when it appeared/lit/shined
That it truly is one (E) (of) the greatest
A warning/notice to the human
For who from you wanted that to advance/precede or delay/lag behind
Every/each self with what (it) earned/gained/acquired (is) accountable
Except the right (side`s) owners
In treed gardens/paradises (are) asking/questioning each other
About the criminals/sinners
What made you enter/follow in Hell
They said: "We were not from praying
And we were not feeding the poorest of poor/poor oppressed
And we were engaging in conversation with the engaging in conversation
And we were denying with the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day
Until the assurance/certainty (death) came to us
So the mediators` mediation does not benefit them
So what (is) for them (they are) from the reminder opposing/objecting
As if they are frightened/running away donkeys
It escaped/fled from cruelty/a lion
But every/each human from them wants/intends that he be given/brought written sheets/pages (books/scriptures) spread/publicized
No but they do not fear the end (other life)
No, but that it (the Koran) truly is a reminder
So who wanted/intended remembered it
And they do not mention/remember except that God wills/wants , He is worthy/relation (owner of) the fear and obedience, and (He is) worthy/relation (owner of) the forgiveness
I do not swear/make oath with the Resurrection Day
And nor I swear/make oath with the self , the often blaming/reprimanding
Does the human/mankind think/suppose that We (will) not gather/unite his bones
Yes/certainly We are capable/able on that (E) We straighten (recreate) his fingertip (finger print)
Rather the human/mankind wants to debauch/corrupt in front of him
He asks/questions: "When (is) the Resurrection Day
So if/when the eye sight/vision glared/gleamed/confused and astonished
And the moon punctured/eclipsed
And the sun and the moon were gathered/collected
The human/mankind that day says: "Where (is) the escape/escape to (shelter)
No but (there is) no shelter
To your Lord that day (is) the settlement
The human/mankind (will) be informed that day with what he advanced/preceded and he delayed
Rather the human/mankind (is) on him self (an) evidence/witness
And even if he threw (gave) his apologies/excuses
Do not move with it your tongue to hurry/hasten/rush with it
That truly on Us (is) gathering/accumulating it , and its reading/recitation
So when/if We read it, so follow its reading/recitation
Then that truly on Us (is) its clarification/explanation
No, but you love/like the worldly life/present
And you leave the end (other life)
Faces/fronts, that day (are) beautiful and good (bright/blooming)
To its Lord looking
And faces/fronts, that day (are) frowning/gloomy
(They) think/suppose that a disaster/calamity will be made/done with it
No, but when/if the collar bones/verge of death reached
And (it) was said: "Who (is) ascended/elevated (being saved)
And (he) thought/assumed that it is the separation
And the shin/leg coiled/wrapped with the shin/leg
To your Lord (on) that day (is) the drive (destination)
So he did not give charity and nor he prayed
And but lied/denied and turned away
Then he went to his people walking stretched with his arms moving in a conceited manner (marching arrogantly)
Woe/warning/threat (Hell) for you, so woe/warning/threat (Hell for you)
Then woe/warning/threat (Hell) for you, so woe/warning/threat (Hell for you)
Does the human/mankind think/suppose that (E) he be left unattended to/disregarded (uncounted with)
Did he not be a drop/male`s or female`s secretion from sperm/semen , semen being ejaculated/ discharged
Then (he) was/became a blood clot , so He created (it), so He straightened/perfected (it)
So He made/created from it the couples/pairs , the male and the female
Is not that with capable/able on that He revives/makes alive the deads
Did (it) come on the human/mankind (a) period of time from the long time he was not a mentioned/remembered thing
That We, We created the human/mankind from a drop/male`s or female`s secretion mixtures (of secretions), We test him, so We made/created him hearing/listening, seeing/knowing
That We, We guided him the way/path , either (he is) thankful/grateful and either (an insistent) disbeliever
That We prepared/made ready for the disbelievers chains/successions, and leather or iron collars or handcuffs and blazing/inflaming (punishment)

A water well/spring God`s worshippers/slaves drink by it, they cause it to flow bursting/flowing
They fulfill/complete with the vow/duty (on oneself) , and they fear a day/time its evil/harm was spread and scattered
And they feed the food on (inspite of) its love/like (to it to) a poorest of poor/poor oppressed and an orphan ,and a captive/prisoner
(They say): "Truly we feed you for God`s sake , we do not want from you a reward/reimbursement ,and nor thankfulness/gratefulness
We (E), fear from our Lord a severe (gloomy) difficult/evil day/time
So God protected/preserved them (from) that the day`s/time`s bad/evil/harm, and He made them meet/find beauty and goodness and delight/happiness
And He rewarded/reimbursed them because (of) what they were patient (by) treed gardens/paradises and silk
Resting/reclining in it on the luxurious beds/couches, they do not see in it sun and nor severe cold/anger
And its shades/shadows (are) near on them, and its fruit harvests was manipulated/dangled low dangling/manipulating
And (they are) being circled around on them with drinking cups from silver and cups (that) were/are clear glass/mirrors
Clear glass/mirrors from silver, they predestined/evaluated it predestination/evaluation
And they be given drink in it (in) a cup its mixture/blend was ginger/wine
A water spring/well in it, it is named Salsbeelan/fresh, smooth and pleasant water fountain
And immortal/eternal children/new borns circle/walk around them, if you saw/understood them you thought/supposed them (that) they (are) scattered/sprinkled pearls
And if you saw/understood, then you saw/understood comfort and ease/blessing and a great ownership/kingdom
Their tops (covers them) clothes/garments (from) green sarcenet (certain type of silk or brocade) and brocade (silk and gold fabric), and they were bejeweled/ornamented (with) bracelets from silver, and their Lord gave/made them drink a pure/clear drink
That truly that was for you a reward/reimbursement , and your striving/endeavor was/is thanked
That We, We descended on you the Koran descent
So be patient for your Lord`s judgment/rule, and do not obey a sinner/criminal (insistent) disbeliever from them
And remember/mention your Lord (at) daybreaks/early mornings and (at) evening to sunset
And from the night, so prostrate to Him, and praise/glorify Him at night/nightly long
That truly those love/like the worldly life/present, and they leave behind them a heavy day/time
We, We created them and We strengthened/supported their bone structure/ties and joints/(strengths) , and if We willed/wanted/intended We exchanged/replaced their equivalent (by) an exchange/replacement
That truly this (is) a reminder, so who wanted took/received a way/path to his Lord
And you do not will/want except that (E) God wills/wants/intends, that truly God was/is knowledgeable, wise/judicious
He enters whom He wills/wants in His mercy, and the unjust/oppressive, He prepared for them a painful torture
And/by the messengers/sent/angles (F) , successively/sand dunes/elevated points
So the stormy/turbulent winds , violently/turbulently
And/by the spreading/extending/winds (for clouds) , spreading out/extending
So the separated clouds/separators of right and wrong , separating
So the throwing/throwing away a reminder/remembrance (delivering messages)

So when/if the stars/planets were eliminated/effaced
And when/if the sky/space opened/split open

Then We make them followed (by) the lasts/others
As/like that We make/do with the criminals/sinners
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers

Leave/go/set out to what you were with it lying/denying/falsifying
Leave/go/set out to shade of three branches/three off shoots
Not shading and nor enriches/suffices (protects) from the flame of a smokeless fire
That it truly throws with sparks as (big) as the castle/palace
As though it (is) camels yellow
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers
That (is) a day/time they do not speak
And nor (it) be permitted/allowed for them so (that) they apologize/excuse themselves
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers

Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers
And when/if (it) was said to them: "Bow ." They do not bow
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers
So with which information/speech after it (do) they believe (in it)
About what (do) they ask/question each other
About the information/news the great
Which they are in it differing/disagreeing
No, but they will know
Then no but they will know
Did We not make the earth/Planet Earth prepared/spread
And the mountains (as) stakes/hooks (anchors)
And We created you pairs/couples/kinds
And We made your sleep rest/tranquil
And We made the night a cover
And We made the daytime (for) livelihood/sustenance
And We built/constructed above you seven strong
And We made a lamp glowing/illuminating
And We descended from the raining clouds strongly flowing/pouring water
To bring out with it seeds/grains and plants/growth
And interwoven/encircled treed gardens/paradises

A day/time the horn/bugle/instrument be blown in, so you come (in) groups/crowds
And the sky/space was opened, so it was/became doors/entrances
And the mountains were made to move , so it was/became a mirage
That truly Hell was/is an observatory/ambuscade
For the tyrants a return
Remaining/waiting in it long periods of time/centuries
They do not taste/experience in it cold/cool and nor a drink
Except hot water/sweat and decayed/rotten
A suiting/fitting reimbursement
That, they truly were not hoping/expecting counting/calculation
And they lied/denied/falsified with Our verses/evidences lying/denying/falsifying
And every thing We counted/computed it (in) a Book/judgment
So taste/experience, so We will never/not increase you except torture
That truly to the fearing and obeying (is) a success/triumph
Fenced gardens and grapes
And full grown breasts and same age/not aging
And a cup filled to the rim
They do not hear/listen in it nonsense/senseless talk and nor lying
Reimbursement from your Lord a gift/grant account
The skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s and what (is) between them (B)`s Lord, the merciful, they do not own/possess from Him an address/conversation (they can not talk to Him)
A day/time the Soul/Spirit and the angels stand (in) a row/arranged , they do not speak/talk ,except who the merciful permitted/allowed for him, and he said right/correct
That (is) the day/time, the real/true/just , so who willed/wanted took/received to his Lord a return
We (E), We warned/gave you notice of (a) near/close torture, a day/time the human/man looks (to) what his two hands advanced/undertook , and the disbeliever says: "Oh, if only I was dust/earth
And/by the strangers/life extractors , exaggerating/absorbing (violently)
And/by the active/pullers , actively/pulling
And/by the ships/stars/fast (could be angels), tending to the livelihood/floating
So the racing/surpassing/preceding, racing/surpassing/preceding
So the regulators/arrangers/planners (of) a matter/affair/order/command

The followed closely behind follows it
Hearts (on) that day (are) palpitating/pounding
Its eyesight/understanding (is) humble/submissive
They say: "Are we returning (E) in the first creation
Is (it that) if we were decayed/decomposed bones
They said: "That is then a loosing repetition
So but it is one deterrent/cry to drive out
So then they are at the Earth`s surface
Did Moses` information/speech come to you
When His Lord called him at the Valley the Holy/Sanctified Tuwan/concealed/folded within
Go to Pharaoh, that he truly exceeded the limit/tyrannized
So say: `Is there for you that (E) you purify/become righteous
And I guide you to your Lord so you fear
So he showed him/made him understand the verse/evidence/sign, the greatest/biggest
So he denied/falsified , and he disobeyed
Then he gave his back/ended/passed hastening
So he gathered, so he called
So he said: "I am your lord the highest/mightiest
So God punished/took him (the) severe exemplary punishment (of) the end (other life) and the first/beginning
That truly in that (is) an example/warning (E) to who fears
Are you (a) stronger creation or the sky/space (which) He built/constructed it
He raised its height/thickness, so He straightened it
And He darkened its night, and He brought out its day break
And the earth/Planet Earth after that He blew and stretched/spread it
He brought out from it its water and its pasture
And the mountains , He anchored it/fixed it firmly
Enjoyment for you and for your camels/livestock
So if/when the Calamity/Greatest Disaster/Resurrection Day the greatest came
A day/time the human/mankind remembers/recites what he strived/endeavored
And the Hell was made to emerge to who sees/understands
So but who exceeded the limit/tyrannized/became arrogant
And preferred/chose the life the present/worldly life
So then the Hell , it is the shelter/refuge
And but who feared his Lord`s position/status and he forbid/prevented the self from the self attraction for desire
So then the Paradise/treed garden, it is the shelter/refuge
They ask/question you about the Hour/Resurrection when (is) its landing
In what you are from mentioning/remembering it (what do you know about it or its time)
To your Lord (is) its ultimate/absolute end
Truly/but you are a warner/giver of notice (to) who fears it
As if they are, a day/time they see it, they did not stay/remain/wait (in their graves) except an evening or its daybreak/forenoon
He frowned/knit or contracted his brows and he turned away
That (E) the blind (man) came to him
And what makes you know/informs you maybe/perhaps he, he purifies/corrects (himself)
Or He mentions/remembers , so the remembrance/reminder benefits him
But/as for who availed/sufficed (rejected)
So you are for him paying attention/being concerned with
And it (is) not on you that he not purifies/corrects (himself)
And but/as for who came to you striving/hastening
And he fears
So you are from him distracted/preoccupied
No, but that it truly is a reminder
So who wanted/willed remembered/mentioned Him
In honoured written pages/sheets (scriptures)
Raised, purified
By messengers`/scribes`/writers` hands
Honoured/generous , righteous/obedient
Killed (`woe`) the human/mankind what made him more disbelieving (an expression)
From what thing He created him
From a drop/male`s or female`s secretion He created him, so He predestined/evaluated/estimated him
Then (to) the road/path He eased him
Then He made him die, so He caused him to be buried in a grave
Then when/if He willed/wanted/intended He revived/resurrected him
No/but he did not (E) accomplish/execute what He ordered/commanded him
So the human/mankind should look/watch to his food
We (E), We poured/flowed the water pouring/flowing
Then We split/cracked the earth/Planet Earth splitting/cracking
So We sprouted/grew in it seeds/grains
(And grapes and all trees and vegetation when it regrows for animal consumption i.e.) clover
And olives and palm trees
And dense/luxurious fenced gardens
And fruits and grass/hay/herbs
Enjoyment for you and for your camels/livestock
So when the Deafening Noise/Resurrection Day came
A day/time the human/man escapes/flees from his brother
And his mother, and his father
And his wife/companion/friend, and his sons and daughters
To every/each human/man from them (on) that day (is) a matter/affair (that) suffices him (worries and keeps him busy)
Faces/fronts (on) that day, lit and shining
Laughing, cheerful/rejoiced
And faces/fronts (on) that day, on it (is) dust
Smoke/dust burdens/depresses/oppresses it
Those, they are the disbelievers, the debauchers/corrupters
When/if the sun`s light rolled/rotated
And when/if the stars/planets became dispersed/dulled
And when/if the mountains were made to move
And when/if the female camels and other livestock over ten months pregnant were abandoned/left unsupervised (miscarried)
And when/if the wild beasts were gathered
And when/if the seas/oceans filled and over flowed
And when/if the selves were made in pairs/couples
And when/if the buried alive was asked/questioned
With (because of) which crime it was killed
And when/if the written pages (scriptures) were spread/publicized
And when/if the sky/space was skimmed/scraped off/uncovered
And when/if the Hell was ignited/blazed
And when/if the Paradise was advanced/brought near
A self knew what it presented/brought
So I do not swear/make oath by the planets
The flowing/orbiting , the orbiting/sweeping planets/stars
And the night when/if (it) passed/lightened
And the morning/daybreak when/if (it) breathed in or out (began)
That it truly is an honored/generous messenger`s word/statement/declaration (E)
(Owner) of power at (owner) of the throne highly positioned/distinguished
Obeyed there at the same time or place, faithful/loyal
And your companion/friend is not with mad/insane
And he/He had seen/understood him/Him at the horizon/direction, the clear/evident
And he is not on the unseen/supernatural (future) with withholding/clinging
And it is not with a cursed/expelled devil`s saying/statement
So where (do) you go
That truly it is except a reminder to the creations all together/(universes)
To who willed/wanted from you that (E) to be straight/direct
And you do not want/will/intend except that (E) (if) God wants/wills/intends, the creations all together`s/(universe`s) Lord
When/if the sky/space split/cracked/cleaved
And when/if the stars/planets scattered/spread
And when/if the seas/oceans burst/over flowed
And when/if the graves/burial places are scattered/over thrown
A self knew what it advanced/preceded and delayed
You, you the human/mankind, what has deceived/tempted you with (from) your Lord, the honoured/generous
Who created you, so He straightened you, so He balanced/adjusted you
In any shape/picture what He willed/intended He assembled/composed you
No but, rather you lie/deny/falsify with the religion
And that truly (We are) on you protectors/observers (E)
Honoured/generous , writing/ordering
They (the angels) know what you make/do
That truly the righteous/charitable (are) in (E) blessing/goodness
And that truly the debauchers/corrupters (are) in (E) Hell
They roast/suffer (from) it (in) the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day
And they are not from it with (being) absent/hidden
And what made you know/informed you what (is) the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day
Then what made you know/informed you what the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day (is)
A day/time a self does not own/possess to a self a thing, and the matter/affair/order/command (on) that day (is) to God
Calamity/scandal to the ones giving insufficient or deficient measures
Those who if they took by measure or weight for themselves on (from) the people, they fulfill/complete (the measure or weight)
And if they measured/weighed for them or they weighed/measured for them , they reduce/decrease (cheat)
Do those not think/assume that they are being resurrected/revived
To a great day/time
A day/time the people stand to the creations all together`s/(universes`) Lord
No but that truly the debauchers`/corrupters` Book/judgment (is) in (E) Sijjin
And what made you know/informed you what (is) Sijjin
A written/branded/inscribed Book
Calamity/scandal (on) that day to the liars/deniers/falsifiers
Those who lie/deny/falsify with the Judgment Day/Resurrection Day
And none lies/denies/falsifiers with it except every/each transgressor/violator , sinner/criminal
When/if Our verses/evidences are read/recited on him he said: "The first`s/beginner`s myths/baseless stories
No but, rather (it) dominated/overwhelmed on their hearts/minds , what they were gaining/acquiring
No but, that they truly are from their Lord (on) that day being prevented (E)
Then that they truly are entering into the fire/roasting (E) the Hell
Then (it) will be said: "That (is) what you were with it lying/denying/falsifying
No but, that truly the righteous`/charitable` Book/judgment (is) in (E) Eley`yeen/height/elevation
And what made you know/informed you what (is) Eley`yoon/highest places
A written/branded/inscribed Book
The neared/closer witness it
That truly the righteous/charitable (are) in (E) blessing/goodness
On the luxurious beds/couches they look/watch
You know in their faces/fronts the blessing`s/goodness` beauty and goodness (brightness)
They are being given water/drink from sealed/completed pure nectar
Its end/conclusion (is) musk/fragrance, and in (for) that so the competitors/rivals should compete/rival
And its mixture/blend (is) from paradises` valuable water
A water spring/well, the neared/closer drink by (near) it
That truly those who committed crimes/sins were laughing/wondering from (about) those who believed
And when/if they passed by them, they signal/wink to each other
And when/if they returned to their people/family , they returned enjoying/humorous
And when/if they saw them they said: "That truly, those are misguided (E)
And they were not sent on them protecting/observing
So the day/today those who believed are laughing/wondering from (about) the disbelievers
On the luxurious beds/couches they (are) looking/watching
Did the disbelievers become rewarded/replaced what they were making/doing
When/if the sky/space split/cracked
And listened/heard (obeyed) to its Lord, and became certain/fact/deserved
And when/if the earth/Planet Earth was extended/spread
And it threw what (is) in it, and became free
And listened/heard (obeyed) to its Lord and became certain/fact/deserved
You, you the human/mankind, that you truly are exerting/labouring/toiling to your Lord exertion/labour/toil, so you (are) receiving/meeting Him
So but who was given/brought his Book/judgment with his right (hand)
So he will be counted/calculated (with an) easy account/calculation
And he returns to his family/people delighted/happy
And but who was given/brought his Book/judgment behind his back
So he will call (for) destruction and grief
And he suffers/burns blazing/inflaming (punishment)
That he truly was in his family/people delighted/happy
That he truly thought/assumed that (E) he will never/not return
Yes/certainly, that truly his Lord was seeing/knowing with (of) him
So I do not swear/make oath with the twilight
And the night, and what carried/gathered/loaded
And the moon when/if it organized/evened/gathered
You will ride/embark (E) a stage/layer/cover from/of/on a stage/layer/cover (they move from one state to another i.e. birth to death)
So why (is it) for them, they do not believe
And when/if the Koran is read on them they, they do not prostrate
But those who disbelieved they lie/deny/falsify
And God (is) more knowing with what they comprehend/perceive/accept
So announce good news to them with (of) a painful torture
Except those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, for them (is) a reward not obligated/interrupted
And/by the sky/space that of the constellations
And/by the Day the Promised/Resurrection Day
And/by a witness/testifier and a witnessed (against)
The geological rift`s-fault line`s owners/company/friends were killed
The fire , that of the fuel
When they are on it sitting/remaining
And they are on what they are making/doing with (to) the believers witnessing/testifying
And they did not revenge/punish from them except (because) that (E) they believe with (in) God, the glorious/mighty , the praiseworthy/commendable
Who for Him (is) the skies`/space`s and the earth`s/Planet Earth`s ownership/kingdom , and God (is) on every thing witnessing
That truly those who tortured/betrayed/allured the believers (M) and the believers (F), then they did not repent, so for them (is) Hell`s torture, and for them (is) the burning`s torture
That truly those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, for them (are) treed gardens/paradises the rivers/waterways flow from below it, that is the winning/success , the great
That truly your Lord`s violent attack/destruction (is) strong (E) (severe)
That He truly creates/initiates , and returns/repeats
And He is the forgiving, the loving/affectionate
(Owner) of the throne , the most glorious/exacted
Maker/doer to what He wills/wants/intends
Did the soldiers`/warriors` information/news come to you
Pharaoh and Thamud
But those who disbelieved (are) in lying/denial/falsification
And God is from behind them surrounding/comprehending
But it is a glorious/exalted Koran
In a protected/guarded tablet/sheet
And/by the sky/space, and/by the Night Comer/star (Morning Star)
And what made you know/informed you what the Night Comer/star (Morning Star is)
The star/planet, the lit/penetrating
That truly every/each self (is) except on it a protector/safe keeper
So the human/mankind should look/see from what he was created
He was created from water pouring/flowing forcefully
It emerges/appears from between the spine and the rib bones
That He truly (is) on returning him capable/able (E)
A day/time the secrets/intentions be tested
So (there is) no strength/power, and nor victorior/savior for him
And the sky/space that of the rain after rain/benefit
And the earth/Planet Earth that of the split/separation/geological rift-fault line
That it truly is a word/statement (of) judgment/partition (decisive)
And it is not with (of) the joke/fun
That they truly plot/conspire a plot/conspiracy
And I plot/conspire a plot/conspiracy
So delay/give time (to) the disbelievers, delay them/give them time slowly/gently
Praise/glorify your Lord`s name the highest/mightiest
Who created, so He straightened
And who predestined/evaluated , so He guided
And who brought out/made (to) emerge the pasture
So He made/created it rotten/spoiled (thin and dry) green/red with blackness
We will make you read, so do not forget
Except what God willed/wanted/intended, that He truly knows the declared/publicized and what hides
And We ease you to the ease/prosperity
So remind if the remembrance/reminder benefited
Who fears will remember/praise/glorify
And the most miserable/unhappy avoids/distances himself from it
Who roasts/suffers the fire , the greatest
Then he does not die in it and nor live
Who purified/corrected had succeeded/won
And mentioned/remembered his Lord`s name, so he prayed
But you prefer/choose the life the present/worldly life
And the end (other life is) better and more lasting (everlasting)
That truly that (is) in (E) the written pages (Books/Scriptures) the first/beginning
Abraham`s and Moses` written pages (Books/Scriptures)
Did the disaster`s/pericardium`s/Resurrection`s information/news come to you
Faces/fronts (on) that day (are) humble/submissive
Making/doing/working, fatigued/exhausted
It roasts/suffers a hot fire
Being given drink/being watered from (a) present/near water well/spring
Food/feeding is not for them except from Dareigh/gland (excretion)
(It) does not fatten (nourish), and nor enriches/suffices from starvation/hunger
Faces/fronts (on) that day (are) comfortable and eased/happy/smooth
Accepting/approving for its striving/endeavor
In an elevated/dignified treed garden/paradise
You do not hear/listen (to) nonsense/senseless talk in it
In it (is a) flowing/running water well/spring
In it (are) raised royal beds/sofas
And laid/raised cups
And lined/arranged small pillows/cushions
And scattered/distributed carpets/rugs
Do they not look/wonder about to the camels how it was created
And to the sky/space how it was raised
And to the mountains how it was erected and raised/affixed
And to the earth/Planet Earth how it was outspread/surfaced
So remind, truly you are a reminder
You are not on them with dominating/controlling
Except who turned away and disbelieved
So God tortures him the torture, the greatest
That truly to Us (is) their return
Then that truly on Us (is) their account/calculation
And/by the dawn
And/by ten nights
And/by the double/even number, and the odd/singular/uneven
And/by the night when (it) goes/departs
Is in that an oath to (those) of (E) a mind
Did you not see/understand how your Lord made/did with Aad
Iram that of the pillars/posts
Which was not created similar/equal to it in the countries/cities
And Thamud who pierced/penetrated the rock/rock terrain at the valley
And Pharaoh that of the stakes/pegs/nails
Those who tyrannized/exceeded the limit in the countries/cities
So they increased (made too much) in it the corruption
So your Lord poured on them (the) torture`s intensity/severity
That truly your Lord (is) at the watch/observation/ambuscade (E)
So but the human/mankind when as long as his Lord tested him, so he honoured him and He blessed/comforted and eased him , so he says: "My Lord honored me
And but when as long as He tested him, so He tightened/strained on him His/his provision, so he says: "My Lord humiliated/disgraced/degraded me
No but, you do not honour/be kind/generous (to) the orphan
And nor you urge/insight/influence on feeding the poorest of poor/poor oppressed
And you eat the inheritance accumulatively/collectively gluttony
And you love/like the property/possession/wealth lovingly excessively
No but, when/if the earth/Planet Earth was hammered down/crushed , crushingly/destroyingly ,crushingly/destroyingly
And your Lord came and the angels (in) a row/arranged (after) a row/arranged
And came (on) that day with Hell ; that day the human/mankind remembers/mentions , and from where (is) for him the remembrance/reminder
He says: "Oh if only I advanced/presented/preceded for my life
So (on) that day no one tortures His torture
And no one ties/chains/affirms His tying/chaining (restraining)
You, you the self, the assured/tranquil
Return to your Lord accepting/approving, accepted/approved
So enter in (among) My worshippers/servants
And enter My treed garden/paradise
I do not swear/make oath with that, the country/land
And you are placed in/occupying (residing) at this , the country/land
And a father and what he gave birth (to)/procreated
We had created the human/mankind in hardship
Does he think/suppose that no one is capable/over powering on (over) him
He says: "I destroyed/wasted plenty property/possession/wealth
Does he think/suppose that (E) no one sees him
Did We not make/create for him two eyes
And a tongue , and two lips
And We guided him (to) the two paths/good or bad
So he did not rush/force (himself) into the high mountain path/road
And what made you know/informed you what the high mountain path/road (is)
Releasing/freeing a neck/person/slave
Or feeding in a day/time of hunger/starvation/famine
An orphan of a relation/near/close
Or a poorest of poor/poor oppressed of poverty
Then he was from those who believed and directed/commanded each other with the patience, and directed/commanded each other with the mercy/compassion
Those are the blessings`/right`s (side`s/hand`s) owners/friends/company
And those who disbelieved with Our verses/evidences , they are the bad omen`s/left side`s owners/friends/company
Stationary/residing fire (is) on them
And/by the sun and its sunrise/day light
And/by the moon when/if it followed it
And/by the daytime when/if it shined/revealed it
And/by the night when/if it covers/darkens it
And/by the sky/space and who built/constructed it
And/by the earth/Planet Earth and who spread and extended it
And/by a self and who straightened it
So He inspired/transmitted (to) it its debauchery/corruption, and its fear and obedience of God
Who purified/corrected it had succeeded/won
And who buried it/plotted against it (corrupted it) had failed/despaired
Thamud had lied/denied/falsified with its own tyranny/excess of the limit
When/if its most miserable/unhappy stirred up/urged
So God`s messenger said to them: "God`s female camel, and its drink/drinking (water)
So they denied him , so they wounded it/slaughtered it/made it infertile, so their Lord became angry/destroyed on them because of their crime, so He straightened it
And He does not fear its end/turn (result)
And/by the night when/if it covers/darkens
And/by the daytime when/if it uncovered/shined
And/by what (who) created the male and the female
That truly your striving/endeavor (is) separate/different (E)
So but who gave/granted and feared and obeyed
And gave charity/confirmed with the best/most beautiful
So We will ease him to the ease/prosperity
And but who was stingy/miser and sufficed/availed
And lied/denied/falsified with the best/most beautiful
So We will ease him to the difficulty/hardship
And his property/possession/wealth does not enrich/suffice (replace) from him if he fell/was destroyed
That truly on Us (is) the guidance (E)
And that truly for Us (is) the end (other life) (E), and the first/beginning
And so I warned you/gave you notice (of) a fire blazing/burning/inflaming
None roasts/suffers it except the most miserable/unhappy
Who lied/denied/falsified and turned away
And the most fearing and obeying will be made to avoid it/be distanced from it
Who gives/brings his property/possession/wealth (and) purifies/corrects (himself)
And (there) is not to anyone at Him from a blessing/goodness to be rewarded/reimbursed
Except wishing/desiring his Lord`s the highest`s/mightiest`s/most dignified`s face/front (path)
And he/He will/shall (E) accept/approve
And/by the sunrise/daybreak
And/by the night when/if it quietened/became covered
Your Lord did not leave/desert you , and nor hate/hit (you) on the head
And the end (other life) (E) (is) better for you than the first/beginning
And your Lord will/shall (E) give/grant you , so you accept/approve
Did He not find you an orphan , so he sheltered (you)
And He found you misguided so He guided (you)
And He found you having dependents/poor , so He enriched/satisfied (you)
So as for the orphan , so do not humiliate/compel
And as for the asker/questioner/beggar , so do not yell at/drive away
And as for with your Lord`s blessing/goodness , so tell/inform
Did We not delight/expand your chest (innermost)
And We raised from you your sin/load/burden
Which weighed heavily (on)/burdened your back
And We raised for you your memory/reputation
So that truly with the difficulty/hardship (is) ease/flexibility
That truly with the difficulty/hardship (is) ease/flexibility
So when/if you finished/ended/completed , so work hard/fatigue
And to your Lord, so wish/desire
And/by the figs and the olives
And/by Seneen Mountain
And/by this the country/land/city , the faithful/secure
We had (E) created the human/mankind in best chronometry/cartography (methods of calculating maps and charts)/straightness (formation)
Then We returned him (to) lowest/more lowly/more mean lowly/mean (lowliest)
Except those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, so for them (is) a not interrupted/weakened reward
So what makes you lie/deny/falsify after with the religion
Is God not with (the) most judicious (of) the judges/rulers
Read by your Lord`s name who created
He created the human/mankind from blood clots/sperm
Read and/by your Lord, the most honoured/generous
Who taught/instructed by the pen/writing utensil
He taught/instructed the human/mankind what he did not know
No but that truly the human/mankind tyrannizes/exceeds the limit (E)
That (E) he saw/understood him(self), he enriched/sufficed (himself)
That truly to your Lord (is) the return
Did you see/understand who forbids/prevents
A worshipper/servant/slave when/if he prayed
Did you see/understand if he was on the guidance
Or he ordered/commanded with the fear and obedience of God
Did you see/understand if he lied/denied/falsified and he turned away
Does he not know with that (E) God sees/understands
No but if (E) he does not end/terminate/stop, We will pull and strike (E) by the forehead/forehead`s hair
A lying/denying/falsifying, sinning/erring/wronging forehead/forehead`s hair
So he should call his caller
We will call the strong ones/patrol force/Elzabaneya angels
No but do not obey him, and prostrate and near/approach (to Me)
We (E) descended it in the predestined/destiny night
And what made you know/informed you what the predestined/destiny night (is)
The predestined/destiny night (is) better than one thousand month (lunar months)
The angels descend and the Soul/Spirit in it, by their Lord`s permission/pardon from every matter/affair
Security/peace it is until the dawn`s ascent/rising
Those who disbelieved from the Book`s people and the sharers/takers of partners (with God) were not broken to pieces/separated until the evidence comes to them
A messenger from God, he reads/recites/follows purified/cleaned written pages (scriptures)
In it (are) straight/valuable Books
And those who were given/brought the Book did not separate except from after what came to them (from) the evidence
And they were not ordered/commanded except to worship God faithful/loyal/devoted to Him (in) the religion (as) submitters/Unifiers of God , and they keep up the prayers, and they give/bring the charity/purification , and that (is) the straight/valuable religion
That truly those who disbelieved from the Book`s people and the sharers/takers of partners (with God are) in Hell`s fire immortally/eternally in it, those, they are the creation`s worst
That truly those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, those, they are the creation`s best
Their reimbursement (is) at their Lord, treed gardens/paradises (as) eternal residence the rivers/waterways flow from beneath it, immortally/eternally in it (for) ever (E), God accepted/approved on them, and they accepted/approved on Him, that (is) to who feared his Lord
When/if the earth/Planet Earth shook/trembled its shaking/trembling/earthquake
And the earth/Planet Earth brought out its loads/weights
And the human/mankind said: "What (is) for it (what is wrong with it)
That day it tells/informs (about) its news/information/knowledge
With that your Lord inspired/transmitted to it
That day, the people proceed/arise separately to see their deeds
So who makes/does a smallest particle of anything (smaller than an atom`s) weight (of) good sees it
And who makes/does a smallest particle of anything (smaller than an atom`s) weight (of) bad/evil sees it
And/by the panting/changing colour , attacking forces/horses
So the igniters (of fire)/swayers , fire striking/sparking/decaying
So the raiders/fast attacking horses (in) mornings/daybreaks
So they stirred and arose/agitated dust/splashing mud or water with it
So they were in the middle with it all together/(in) a group
That truly the human/mankind (is) ungrateful/disobedient (E) to his Lord
And he truly (is) on that witnessing/testifying (E)
And that he truly to the good`s/wealth`s love/like (is) strong (intense) (E) (humans love excessive goodness)
So does he not know when what (is) in the graves/burial places is scattered/over thrown/strewn
And what (is) in the chests (innermosts) is recovered/collected
That truly their Lord (is) with them (on) that day expert/experienced (E)
The resurrection/disaster/calamity
What (is) the resurrection/disaster/calamity
And what made you know/informed you what the resurrection/disaster/calamity (is)
A day/time the people be/become like the butterflies, the scattered/ravished
And the mountains be/become like the wool/dyed wool, the carded (ruffled)
So as for who his weights became heavy
So he is in (an) acceptable/approved life/quality of life
And but who his weights were reduced/lightened
So his origin (is) Hell/destruction
And what made you know/informed you what it is (E)
hot fire
The multiplication distracted/diverted you
Until you visited the cemeteries/burial places
No but you will/shall know
Then no but you will/shall know
No but if you know knowledge (of) the assurance/certainty
You would see/understand (E) the Hell
Then you will see/understand it (with) the assurance`s/certainty`s eye (visually)
Then (on) that day you will be asked/questioned (E) about the blessing/goodness
And/by the time/era/end of day to dusk
That truly the human/mankind (is) in (E) loss
Except those who believed and made/did the correct/righteous deeds, and directed/commanded with the truth/just , and directed/commanded with the patience
Calamity/scandal/woe to every/each backbiter/spurrer , defamer/blamer
Who gathered/accumulated property/possession/wealth and he counted it repeatedly
He thinks/supposes that (E) his property/possession/wealth made him immortal/eternal
No but he will be discarded/thrown away (E) in the intense fire/Hell
And what made you know/informed you what the intense fire/Hell (is)
God`s fire, the ignited/kindled
Which ascends/rises on (to) the hearts
That it truly is on them stationary/residing
In extended/spread pillars/posts
Did you not see/understand how (what) your Lord made/did with the elephant`s owners/company/ friends
Did He not make their plotting/conspiring in misguidance
And He sent on them flying/birds (in) flocks/groups gathered and following each other
It throws them with stones from dry and hardened mud
So He made them like eaten husk/chaff/leaves
To Koreish`s unification/familiarity
Their unification/familiarization (with) the winter`s and the summer`s travel/journey
So they should worship this, the House`s/Home`s Lord
Who fed them from starvation/hunger, and secured them from fear/fright
Did you see/understand who lies/denies/falsifies with the religion
So that (is) who turns down/repels the orphan
And does not urge/insight/influence on feeding the poorest of poor/poor oppressed
So calamity/scandal/woe to the prayers (praying people)
Those whom they are about their prayers negligent/inattentive
Those whom they are pretending/showing off (what they are not)
And they prevent/stop the charity
We (E), We gave/granted you the abundance (of goodness)
So pray to your Lord, and be perfect/excellent/slaughter (for charity)
That truly your hater and enemy, he is the mean and despised/of no good
Say: "You, you the disbelievers
I do not worship what you worship
And you are not worshipping what I worship
And nor I am worshipping what you worshipped
And nor you are worshipping what I worship
For you (is) your religion, and for me (is) my religion
When/if God`s victory/aid came, and the opening/judgment
And you saw the people entering in God`s religion (in) groups/crowds
So praise/glorify with your Lord`s praise/gratitude/thanks, and ask him for forgiveness, that He truly was/is forgiving
Father of the flame of a smokeless fire`s (known as Prophet Mohammad`s uncle) hand was destroyed/lost, and destroyed/lost
His property/possession/wealth and what he gained/acquired did not enrich/suffice from him
