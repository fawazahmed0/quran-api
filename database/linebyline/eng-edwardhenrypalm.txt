IN the name of the merciful and compassionate God
Praise belongs to God, the Lord of the worlds
the merciful, the compassionate
the ruler of the day of judgment
Thee we serve and Thee we ask for aid
Guide us in the right path
the path of those Thou art gracious to; not of those Thou art wroth with; nor of those who err
ALIF LAM MIM
That is the book! there is no doubt therein; a guide to the pious
who believe in the unseen, and are steadfast in prayer, and of what we have given them expend in alms
who believe in what is revealed to thee, and what was revealed before thee, and of the hereafter they are sure
These are in guidance from their Lord, and these are the prosperous
Verily, those who misbelieve, it is the same to them if ye warn them or if ye warn them not, they will not believe
God has set a seal upon their hearts and on their hearing; and on their eyes is dimness, and for them is grievous woe
And there are those among men who say, 'We believe in God and in the last day;' but they do not believe
They would deceive God and those who do believe; but they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive
In their hearts is a sickness, and God has made them still more sick, and for them is grievous woe because they lied
And when it is said to them, 'Do not evil in the earth,' they say, 'We do but what is right
Are not they the evildoers? and yet they do not perceive
And when it is said to them, 'Believe as other men believe,' they say, 'Shall we believe as fools believe?' Are not they themselves the fools? and yet they do not know
And when they meet those who believe, they say, 'We do believe;' but when they go aside with their devils, they say, 'We are with you; we were but mocking
God shall mock at them and let them go on in their rebellion, blindly wandering on
Those who buy error for guidance, their traffic profits not, and they are not guided
Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindles a fire; and when it lights up all around, God goes off with their light, and leaves them in darkness that they cannot see
Deafness, dumbness, blindness, and they shall not return
Or like a storm-cloud from the sky, wherein is darkness and thunder and lightning; they put their fingers in their ears at the thunder-clap, for fear of death, for God encompasses the misbelievers
The lightning well-nigh snatches off their sight, whenever it shines for them they walk therein; but when it is dark for them they halt; and if God willed He would go off with their hearing and their sight; verily, God is mighty over all
O ye folk! serve your Lord who created you and those before you; haply ye may fear
who made the earth for you a bed and the heaven a dome; and sent down from heaven water, and brought forth therewith fruits as a sustenance for you; so make no peers for God, the while ye know
And if ye are in doubt of what we have revealed unto our servant, then bring a chapter like it, and call your witnesses other than God if ye tell truth
But if ye do it not, and ye shall surely do it not, then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for misbelievers
But bear the glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow; whenever they are provided with fruit therefrom they say, 'This is what we were provided with before,' and they shall be provided with the like; and there are pure wives for them therein, and they shall dwell therein for aye
Why, God is not ashamed to set forth a parable of a gnat, or anything beyond; and as for those who believe, they know that it is truth from the Lord; but as for those who disbelieve, they say, 'What is it that God means by this as a parable? He leads astray many and He guides many;' - but He leads astray only the evildoers
who break God's covenant after the fixing thereof, and cut asunder what God has ordered to be joined, and do evil in the earth;- these it is who lose
How can ye disbelieve in God, when ye were dead and He made you alive, and then He will kill you and then make you alive again, and then to Him will ye return
It is He who created for you all that is in the earth, then he made for the heavens and fashioned them seven heavens; and He knows all things
And when thy Lord said unto the angels, 'I am about to place a vicegerent in the earth,' they said, 'Wilt Thou place therein one who will do evil therein and shed blood? we celebrate Thy praise and hallow Thee.' Said (the Lord), 'I know what ye know not
And He taught Adam the names, all of them; then He propounded them to the angels and said, 'Declare to me the names of these, if ye are truthful
They said, 'Glory be to Thee! no knowledge is ours but what Thou thyself hast taught us, verily, Thou art the knowing, the wise
Said the Lord, 'O Adam declare to them their names;' and when he had declared to them their names He said, Did I not say to you, I know the secrets of the heavens and of the earth, and I know what ye show and what ye were hiding
And when we said to the angels, 'Adore Adam,' they adored him save only Iblis, who refused and was too proud and became one of the misbelievers
And we said, 'O Adam dwell, thou and thy wife, in Paradise, and eat therefrom amply as you wish; but do not draw near this tree or ye will be of the transgressors
And Satan made them backslide therefrom and drove them out from what they were in, and we said, 'Go down, one of you the enemy of the other, and in the earth there is an abode and a provision for a time
And Adam caught certain words from his Lord, and He turned towards him, for He is the compassionate one easily turned
We said, 'Go down therefrom altogether and haply there may come from me a guidance, and whoso follows my guidance, no fear is theirs, nor shall they grieve
But those who misbelieve, and call our signs lies, they are the fellows of the Fire, they shall dwell therein for aye
O ye children of Israel! remember my favours which I have favoured you with; fulfil my covenant and I will fulfil your covenant; me therefore dread
Believe in what I have revealed, verifying what ye have got, and be not the first to disbelieve in it, and do not barter my signs for a little price, and me do ye fear
Clothe not truth with vanity, nor hide the truth the while ye know
Be steadfast in prayer, give the alms, and bow down with those who bow
Will ye order men to do piety and forget yourselves? ye read the Book, do ye not then understand
Seek aid with patience and prayer, though it is a hard thing save for the humble
who think that they will meet their Lord, and that to Him will they return
O ye children of Israel! remember my favours which I have favoured you with, and that I have preferred you above the worlds
Fear the day wherein no soul shall pay any recompense for another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted for it, nor shall compensation be taken from it, nor shall they be helped
When we saved you from Pharaohs people who sought to wreak you evil and woe, slaughtering your sons and letting your women live; in that was a great trial for you from your Lord
When we divided for you the sea and saved you and drowned Pharaohs people while ye looked on
When we treated with Moses forty nights, then ye took the calf after he had gone and ye did wrong
Yet then we forgave you after that; perhaps ye may be grateful
And when we gave Moses the Scriptures and the Discrimination; perhaps ye will be guided
When Moses said to his people, 'O my people! Ye have wronged yourselves in taking this calf; repent unto your Creator and kill each other; that will be better for you in your Creators eyes; and He turned unto you, for He is the compassionate one easily turned
And when ye said to Moses, 'O Moses! we will not believe in thee until we see God manifestly,' and the thunderbolt caught you while ye yet looked on
Then we raised you up after your death; perhaps ye may be grateful
And we overshadowed you with the cloud, and sent down the manna and the quails; 'Eat of the good things we have given you.' They did not wrong us, but it was themselves they were wronging
And when we said, 'Enter this city and eat therefrom as plentifully as ye wish; and enter the gate worshipping and say 'hittatun. So will we pardon you your sins and give increase unto those who do well
But those who did wrong changed it for another word than that which was said to them: and we sent down upon those who did wrong, wrath from heaven for that they had so sinned
When Moses, too, asked drink for his people and we said, 'Strike with thy staff the rock,' and from it burst forth twelve springs; each man among them knew his drinking place. 'Eat and drink of what God has provided, and transgress not on the earth as evildoers
And when they said, 'O Moses, we cannot always bear one kind of food; pray then thy Lord to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its green herbs, its cucumbers, its garlic, its lentils, and its onions.' Said he, 'Do ye ask what is meaner instead of what is best? Go down to Egypt,- there is what ye ask.' Then were they smitten with abasement and poverty, and met with wrath from God. That was because they had misbelieved in God's signs and killed the prophets undeservedly; that was for that they were rebellious and had transgressed
Verily, whether it be of those who believe, or those who are Jews or Christians or Sabaeans, whosoever believe in God and the last day and act aright, they have their reward at their Lords hand, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve
And when we took a covenant with you and held the mountain over you; ' Accept what we have brought you with strong will, and bear in mind what is therein, haply ye yet may fear
Then did ye turn aside after this, and were it not for God's grace towards you and His mercy, ye would have been of those who lose
Ye know too of those among you who transgressed upon the Sabbath, and we said, 'Become ye apes, despised and spurned
Thus we made them an example unto those who stood before them, and those who should come after them, and a warning unto those who fear
And when Moses said to his people, 'God bids you slaughter a cow,' they said, 'Art thou making a jest of us?' Said he, 'I seek refuge with God from being one of the unwise
They said, 'Then pray thy Lord for us to show us what she is to be.' He answered, 'He saith it is a cow, nor old, nor young, of middle age between the two; so do as ye are bid
They said, 'Pray now thy Lord to show us what her colour is to be.' He answered, 'He saith it is a dun cow, intensely dun, her colour delighting those who look upon her
Again they said, 'Pray thy Lord to show us what she is to be; for cows appear the same to us; then we, if God will, shall be guided
He answered, 'He saith, it is a cow, not broken in to plough the earth or irrigate the tilth, a sound one with no blemish on her.' They said, 'Now hast thou brought the truth.' And they slaughtered her, though they came near leaving it undone
When too ye slew a soul and disputed thereupon, and God brought forth that which ye had hidden
then we said, 'Strike him with part of her.' Thus God brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, that haply ye may understand
Yet were your hearts hardened even after that, till they were as stones or harder still, for verily of stones are some from which streams burst forth, and of them there are some that burst asunder and the water issues out, and of them there are some that fall down for fear of God; but God is never careless of what ye do
Do ye crave that they should believe you when already a sect of them have heard the word of God and then perverted it after they had understood it, though they knew
And when they meet those who believe they say, 'We believe,' but when one goes aside with another they say, 'Will ye talk to them of what God has opened up to you, that they may argue with you upon it before your Lord? Do ye not therefore understand
Do they not then know that God knoweth what they keep secret and what they make known abroad
And some of them there are, illiterate folk, that know not the Book, but only idle tales; for they do but fancy
But woe to those who write out the Book with their hands and say 'this is from God;' to buy therewith a little price! and woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they gain
And then they say, 'Hell fire shall not touch us save for a number of days.' Say, 'Have ye taken a covenant with God?' but God breaks not His covenant. Or do ye say of God that which ye do not know
Yea! whoso gains an evil gain, and is encompassed by his sins, those are the fellows of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein for aye
But such as act aright, those are the fellows of Paradise, and they shall dwell therein for aye
And when we took from the children of Israel a covenant, saying, 'Serve ye none but God, and to your two parents show kindness, and to your kindred and the orphans and the poor, and speak to men kindly, and be steadfast in prayer, and give alms;' and then ye turned back, save a few of you, and swerved aside
And when we took covenant from you, 'shed ye not your kinsmans blood, nor turn your kinsmen out of their homes:' then did ye confirm it and were witnesses thereto
Yet ye were those who slay your kinsmen and turn a party out of their homes, and back each other up against them with sin and enmity. But if they come to you as captives ye ransom them!- and yet it is as unlawful for you to turn them out. Do ye then believe in part of the Book and disbelieve in part? But the reward of such among you as do that shall be nought else but disgrace in this worldly life, and on the day of the resurrection shall they be driven to the most grievous torment, for God is not unmindful of what ye do
Those who have bought this worldly life with the Future, the torment shall not be lightened from them nor shall they be helped
We gave Moses the Book and we followed him up with other apostles, and we gave Jesus the son of Mary manifest signs and aided him with the Holy Spirit. Do ye then, every time an apostle comes to you with what your souls love not, proudly scorn him, and charge a part with lying and slay a part
They say, 'Our hearts are uncircumcised;' nay, God has cursed them in their unbelief, and few it is who do believe
And when a book came down from God confirming what they had with them, though they had before prayed for victory over those who misbelieve, yet when that came to them which they knew, then they disbelieved it,- God's curse be on the misbelievers
For a bad bargain have they sold their souls, not to believe in what God has revealed, grudging because God sends down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He will; and they have brought on themselves wrath after wrath and for the misbelievers is there shameful woe
And when they are told to believe in what God has revealed, they say, 'We believe in what has been revealed to us;' but they disbelieve in all beside, although it is the truth confirming what they have. Say, 'Wherefore did ye kill God's prophets of yore if ye were true believers
Moses came to you with manifest signs, then ye took up with the calf when he had gone and did so wrong
And when we took a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you, 'Take what we have given you with resolution and hear;' they said, 'We hear but disobey;' and they were made to drink the calf down into their hearts for their unbelief. Say, 'An evil thing is it which your belief bids you do, if ye be true believers
Say, 'If the abode of the future with God is yours alone and not mankinds: long for death then if ye speak the truth
But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent on before; but God is knowing as to the wrong doers
Why, thou wilt find them the greediest of men for life; and of those who associate others with God one would fain live for a thousand years,- but he will not be reprieved from punishment by being let live, for God seeth what they do
Say, 'Who is an enemy to Gabriel?' for he hath revealed to thy heart, with God's permission, confirmation of what had been before, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers
Who is an enemy to God and His angels and His apostles and Gabriel and Michael?- Verily, God is an enemy to the unbelievers
We have sent down to thee conspicuous signs, and none will disbelieve therein except the evildoers
Or every time they make a covenant, will a part of them repudiate it? Nay, most of them do not believe
And when there comes to them an apostle confirming what they have, a part of those who have received the Book repudiate God's book, casting it behind their backs as though they did not know
And they follow that which the devils recited against Solomons kingdom;- it was not Solomon who misbelieved, but the devils who misbelieved, teaching men sorcery,- and what has been revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut; yet these taught no one until they said, 'We are but a temptation, so do not misbelieve.' Men learn from them only that by which they may part man and wife; but they can harm no one therewith, unless with the permission of God, and they learn what hurts them and profits them not. And yet they knew that he who purchased it would have no portion in the future; but sad is the price at which they have sold their souls, had they but known
But had they believed and feared, a reward from God were better, had they but known
O ye who believe! say not 'ra'hina,' but say 'unthurna,' and hearken; for unto misbelievers shall be grievous woe
They who misbelieve, whether of those who have the Book or of the idolaters, would fain that no good were sent down to you from your Lord; but God specially favours with His mercy whom He will, for God is Lord of mighty grace
Whatever verse we may annul or cause thee to forget, we will bring a better one than it, or one like it; dost thou not know that God is mighty over all
Dost thou not know that God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? nor have ye besides God a patron or a help
Do ye wish to question your apostle as Moses was questioned aforetime? but whoso takes misbelief in exchange for faith has erred from the level road
Many of those who have the Book would fain turn you back into misbelievers after ye have once believed, through envy from themselves, after the truth has been made manifest to them; but pardon and shun them till God brings His command; verily, God is mighty over all
Be ye steadfast in prayer, and give alms; and whatsoever good ye send before for your own souls, ye shall find it with God, for God in all ye do doth see
They say, 'None shall enter Paradise save such as be Jews or Christians;' that is their faith. Say thou, 'Bring your proofs, if ye be speaking truth
Aye, he who resigns his face to God, and who is kind, he shall have his reward from his Lord, and no fear shall be on them, and they shall not grieve
The Jews say, 'The Christians rest on nought;' and the Christians say, 'The Jews rest on nought;' and yet they read the Book. So, too, say those who know not, like to what these say; but God shall judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that whereon they do dispute
But who is more unjust than he who prohibits God's mosques, that His name should not be mentioned there, and who strives to ruin them? 'Tis not for such to enter into them except in fear, for them is disgrace in this world, and in the future mighty woe
God's is the east and the west, and wherever ye turn there is God's face; verily, God comprehends and knows
They say, 'God takes unto Himself a son.' Celebrated be His praise! Nay, His is what is in the heavens and the earth, and Him all things obey
The Originator of the heavens and the earth, when He decrees a matter He doth but say unto it, 'BE,' and it is
And those who do not know (the Scriptures) say, 'Unless God speak to us, or there comes a sign.' So spake those before them like unto their speech. Their hearts are all alike. We have made manifest the signs unto a people that are sure
We have sent thee with the truth, a bearer of good tidings and of warning, and thou shalt not be questioned as to the fellows of hell
The Jews will not be satisfied with thee, nor yet the Christians, until thou followest their creed. Say, 'God's guidance is the guidance;' and if thou followest their lusts after the knowledge that has come to thee, thou hast not then from God a patron or a help
They to whom we have brought the Book and who read it as it should be read, believe therein; and whoso disbelieve therein, 'tis they who lose thereby
O children of Israel! remember my favours with which I favoured you, and that I have preferred you over the worlds
And fear the day when no soul shall pay a recompense for a soul, nor shall an equivalent be received therefrom, nor any intercession avail; and they shall not be helped
And when his Lord tried Abraham with words, and he fulfilled them, He said, 'Verily, I will set thee as a high priest for men.' Said he, ' And of my seed?' God said, 'My covenant touches not the evildoers
And when we made the House a place of resort unto men, and a sanctuary, and (said) take the station of Abraham for a place of prayer; and covenanted with Abraham and Ishmael, saying, 'Do ye two cleanse my house for those who make the circuit, for those who pay devotions there, for those who bow down, and for those too who adore
When Abraham said, 'Lord, make this a town of safety, and provide the dwellers there with fruits, such as believe in God and the last day!' (God) said, ' And he who misbelieves, I will give him but little to enjoy, then will drive him to the torment of the fire, an evil journey will it be
And when Abraham raised up the foundations of the House with Ishmael, 'Lord! receive it from us, verily, thou art hearing and dost know
Lord! and make us too resigned unto Thee, and of our seed also a nation resigned unto Thee, and show us our rites, and turn towards us, verily, Thou art easy to be turned and merciful
Lord! and send them an apostle from amongst themselves, to read to them Thy signs and teach them the Book and wisdom, and to purify them; verily, Thou art the mighty and the wise
Who is averse from the faith of Abraham save one who is foolish of soul? for we have chosen him in this world, and in the future he is surely of the righteous
When his Lord said to him, 'Be resigned,' he said, 'I am resigned unto the Lord of the worlds
And Abraham instructed his sons therein, and Jacob (saying), 'O my sons! verily, God has chosen for you a religion, do not therefore die unless ye be resigned
Were ye then witnesses when Jacob was facing death, when he said to his sons, 'What will ye serve when I am gone?' They said, 'We will serve thy God, the God of thy fathers Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, one God; and we are unto Him resigned
That is a nation that has passed away, theirs is what they gained; and yours shall be what ye have gained; ye shall not be questioned as to that which they have done
They say, 'Be ye Jews or Christians so shall ye of Abraham be guided.' Say, 'Not so! but the faith of Abraham the 'Hanif, be was not of the idolaters
Say ye, 'We believe in God, and what has been revealed to us, and what has been revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was brought to Moses and Jesus, and what was brought unto the Prophets from their Lord; we will not distinguish between any one of them, and unto Him are we resigned
If they believe in that in which ye believe, then are they guided; but if they turn back, then are they only in a schism, and God will suffice thee against them, for He both hears and knows
The dye of God! and who is better than God at dyeing? and we are worshippers of Him
Say, 'Do ye dispute with us concerning God, and He is our Lord and your Lord? Ye have your works and we have ours, and unto Him are we sincere
Do ye say that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, 'Are ye more knowing than God? Who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony that he has from God?' But God is not careless of what ye do
That is a nation that has passed away; theirs is what they gained, and yours shall be what ye have gained; ye shall not be questioned as to that which they have done
The fools among men will say, 'What has turned them from their qiblah, on which they were agreed?' Say, 'God's is the east and the west, He guides whom He will unto the right path
Thus have we made you a middle nation, to be witnesses against men, and that the Apostle may be a witness against you. We have not appointed the qiblah on which thou wert agreed, save that we might know who follows the Apostle from him who turns upon his heels although it is a great thing save to those whom God doth guide. But God will not waste your faith, for verily, God with men is kind and merciful
We see thee often turn about thy face in the heavens, but we will surely turn thee to a qiblah thou shalt like. Turn then thy face towards the Sacred Mosque; wherever ye be, turn your faces towards it; for verily, those who have the Book know that it is the truth from their Lord;- God is not careless of that which ye do
And if thou shouldst bring to those who have been given the Book every sign, they would not follow your qiblah; and thou art not to follow their qiblah; nor do some of them follow the qiblah of the others: and if thou followest their lusts after the knowledge that has come to thee then art thou of the evildoers
Those whom we have given the Book know him as they know their sons, although a sect of them do surely hide the truth, the while they know
The truth (is) from thy Lord; be not therefore one of those who doubt thereof
Every sect has some one side to which they turn (in prayer); but do ye hasten onwards to good works; wherever ye are God will bring you all together; verily, God is mighty over all
From whencesoever thou comest forth, there turn thy face towards the Sacred Mosque, for it is surely truth from thy Lord; God is not careless about what ye do
And from whencesoever thou comest forth, there turn thy face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wheresoever ye are, turn your faces towards it, that men may have no argument against you, save only those of them who are unjust; and fear them not, but fear me and I will fulfil my favours to you, perchance ye may be guided yet
Thus have we sent amongst you an apostle of yourselves, to recite to you our signs, to purify you and teach you the Book and wisdom, and to teach you what ye did not know
remember me, then, and I will remember you; thank me, and do not misbelieve
O ye who do believe! seek aid from patience and from prayer, verily, God is with the patient
And say not of those who are slain in God's way (that they are) dead, but rather living; but ye do not perceive
We will try you with something of fear, and hunger and loss of wealth, and souls and fruit; but give good tidings to the patient
who when there falls on them a calamity say, 'Verily, we are God's and, verily, to Him do we return
These, on them are blessings from their Lord and mercy, and they it is who are guided
Verily, Zafa and Merwah are of the beacons of God, and he who makes the pilgrimage unto the House, or visits it, it is no crime for him to compass them both about; and he who obeys his own impulse to a good work,- God is grateful and doth know
Verily, those who hide what we have revealed of manifest signs and of guidance after we have manifested it to men in the Book, them God shall curse, and those who curse shall curse them too
Save those who turn and do right and make (the signs) manifest; these will I turn to again, for I am easy to be turned and merciful
Verily, those who misbelieve and die while still in misbelief, on them is the curse of God, and of the angels, and of mankind altogether
to dwell therein for aye; the torment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they be looked upon
Your God is one God; there is no God but He, the merciful, the compassionate
Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the alternation of night and day, and in the ship that runneth in the sea with that which profits man, and in what water God sends down from heaven and quickens therewith the earth after its death, and spreads abroad therein all kinds of cattle, and in the shifting of the winds, and in the clouds that are pressed into service betwixt heaven and earth, are signs to people who can understand
Yet are there some amongst mankind who take to themselves peers other than God; they love them as they should love God while those who believe love God more. O that those who are unjust could only see, when they see the torment, that power is altogether God's! Verily, God is keen to torment
When those who are followed clear themselves of those who followed them, and see the torment, and the cords are cut asunder
those who followed shall say, 'Had we but another turn, then would we clear ourselves of them as they have cleared themselves of us.' So will God show them their works; for them are sighs, and they shall not come forth from out the fire
O ye folk! eat of what is in the earth, things lawful and things good, and follow not the footsteps of Satan, verily, to you he is an open foe
He does but bid you evil and sin, and that ye should speak against God what ye do not know
When it is said to them, 'Follow what God has revealed,' they say, 'Nay, we will follow what we found our fathers agreed upon.' What! and though their fathers had no sense at all or guidance
The likeness of those who misbelieve is as the likeness of him who shouts to that which hears him not, save only a call and a cry; deafness, dumbness, blindness, and they shall not understand
O ye who do believe! eat of the good things wherewith we have provided you, and give thanks unto God if it be Him ye serve
He has only forbidden for you what is dead, and blood, and flesh of swine, and whatsoever has been consecrated to other than God; but he who is forced, neither revolting nor transgressing, it is in no sin for him; verily, God is forgiving and merciful
Verily, those who hide what God has revealed of the Book, and sell it for a little price, they shall eat nothing in their bellies save fire; and God will not speak to them on the day of resurrection, nor will He purify them, but for them is grievous woe
They who sell guidance for error, and pardon for torment, how patient must they be of fire
That (is), because God has revealed the Book with truth, and verily those who disagree about the Book are in a wide schism
Righteousness is not that ye turn your faces towards the east or the west, but righteousness is, one who believes in God, and the last day, and the angels, and the Book, and the prophets, and who gives wealth for His love to kindred, and orphans, and the poor, and the son of the road, beggars, and those in captivity; and who is steadfast in prayer, and gives alms; and those who are sure of their covenant when they make a covenant; and the patient in poverty, and distress, and in time of violence; these are they who are true, and these are those who fear
O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you for the slain: the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the female for the female; yet he who is pardoned at all by his brother, must be prosecuted in reason, and made to pay with kindness. That is an alleviation from your Lord, and a mercy; and he who transgresses after that for him is grievous woe
For you in retaliation is there life, O ye possessors of minds! it may be ye will fear
It is prescribed for you that when one of you is face to face with death, if he leave (any) goods, the legacy is to his parents, and to his kinsmen, in reason. A duty this upon all those that fear
But he who alters it after that he has heard it, the sin thereof is only upon those who alter it; verily, God doth hear and know
And he who fears from the testator a wrong intention, or a crime, and doth make up the matter between the parties, it is no sin to him; verily, God is forgiving and merciful
O ye who believe! There is prescribed for you the fast as it was prescribed for those before you; haply ye may fear
A certain number of days, but he amongst you who is ill or on a journey, then (let him fast) another number of days. And those who are fit to fast may redeem it by feeding a poor man; but he who follows an impulse to a good work it is better for him; and if ye fast it is better for you, if ye did but know
The month of Ramadhan, wherein was revealed the Koran, for a guidance to men, and for manifestations of guidance, and for a Discrimination. And he amongst you who beholds this month then let him fast it; but he who is sick or on a journey, then another number of days;- God desires for you what is easy, and desires not for you what is difficult,- that ye may complete the number, and say, 'Great is God,' for that He has guided you; haply ye may give thanks
When my servants ask thee concerning me, then, verily, I am near; I answer the prayers prayer whenever he prays to me. So let them ask me for an answer, and let them believe in me; haply they may be directed aright
Lawful for you on the night of the fast is commerce with your wives; they are a garment unto you, and ye a garment unto them. God knows that ye did defraud yourselves, wherefore He has turned towards you and forgiven you; so now go in unto them and crave what God has prescribed for you, and eat and drink until a white thread can be distinguished by you from a black one at the dawn. Then fulfil the fast until the night, and go not in unto them, and ye at your devotions in the mosques the while. These are the bounds that God has set, so draw not near thereto. Thus does God make manifest His signs to men, that haply they may fear
Devour not your wealth among yourselves vainly, nor present it to the judges that ye may devour a part of the wealth of men sinfully, the while ye know
They will ask thee about the phases of the moon; say, 'They are indications of time for men and for the pilgrimage.' And it is not righteousness that ye should enter into your houses from behind them, but righteousness is he who fears; so enter into your houses by the doors thereof and fear God; haply ye may prosper yet
Fight in God's way with those who fight with you, but transgress not; verily, God loves not those who do transgress
Kill them wherever ye find them, and drive them out from whence they drive you out; for sedition is worse than slaughter; but fight them not by the Sacred Mosque until they fight you there; then kill them, for such is the recompense of those that misbelieve
But if they desist, then, verily, God is forgiving and merciful
But fight them that there be no sedition and that the religion may be God's; but, if they desist, then let there be no hostility save against the unjust
The sacred month for the sacred month; for all sacred things demand retaliation; and whoso transgresses against you, transgress against him like as he transgressed against you; but fear ye God, and know that God is with those who fear
Expend in alms in God's way and be not cast by your own hands into perdition; but do good, for God loves those who do good
And fulfil the pilgrimage and the visitation to God; but if ye be besieged, then what is easiest for you by way of gift. But shave not your heads until your gift shall reach its destination; and he amongst you who is sick or has a hurt upon his head, then the redemption is by fasting or by alms or by an offering. But when ye are safe again, then let him who would enjoy the visitation until the pilgrimage (bring) what is easiest as a gift. And he who cannot find (anything to bring), then let him fast three days on the pilgrimage and seven when ye return; these make ten days complete. That is, for him whose family are not present in the Sacred Mosque; and fear God and know that God is keen to punish
The pilgrimage is (in) well-known months: whosoever then makes it incumbent on himself (let him have neither) commerce with women, nor fornication, nor a quarrel on the pilgrimage; and whatsoever of good ye do, God knoweth it; then provide yourself for your journey; but the best provision is piety. Fear ye me ye who possess minds
It is no crime to you that ye seek good from your Lord; but when ye pour forth from 'Arafat, remember God by the sacred beacon. Remember Him how He guided you, although ye were surely before of those who err
Then pour ye forth from whence men do pour forth and ask pardon of God; verily, God is forgiving and merciful
And when ye have performed your rites, remember God as ye remember your fathers, or with a keener memory still. There is among men such as says, 'Our Lord! give us in this world;' but of the future life no portion shall he have
And some there be who say, 'Our Lord! give us in this world good and in the future good; and keep us from the torment of the fire
These,- they have their portion from what they have earned; for God is swift at reckoning up
Remember God for a certain number of days; but whoso hastens off in two days, it is no sin to him, and he who lingers on it is no sin to him,- for him who fears. So fear ye God and know that unto Him shall ye be gathered
There is among men one whose speech about the life of this world pleases thee, and he calls on God to witness what is in his heart; yet is he most fierce in opposition unto thee
And when he turns away, he strives upon the earth to do evil therein, and to destroy the tilth and the stock; verily, God loves not evil doing
And when it is said to him, 'Fear God,' then pride takes hold upon him in sin; but hell is enough for him! surely an evil couch is that
And there is among men one who selleth his soul craving, those things that are pleasing unto God and God is kind unto His servants
O ye who believe! enter ye into the peace, one and all, and follow not the footsteps of Satan; verily, to you he is an open foe
And if ye slip after that the manifest signs have come to you, then know that God is the mighty, the wise
What can they expect but that God should come unto them in the shadow of a cloud, and the angels too? But the thing is decreed, and unto God do things return
Ask the children of Israel how many a manifest sign we gave to them; and whoso alters God's favours after that they have come to him, then God is keen at following up
Made fair to those who misbelieve is this worlds life; they jest at those who do believe. But those who fear shall be above them on the resurrection day. God gives provision unto whom He will without account
Men were one nation once, and God sent prophets with good tidings and with warnings, and sent down with them the Book in truth, to judge between men in that wherein they disagreed; but none did disagree therein save those who had been given it after that manifest signs had come to them, through greed amongst themselves; and God guided those who did believe to that truth concerning which they disagreed by His permission, for God guides whom He will unto the right path
Did ye count to enter Paradise, while there had nothing come to you like those who passed away before you; there touched them violence and harm, and they were made to quake, until the Apostle and those who believed with him said, 'When (comes) God's help? Is not God's help then surely nigh
They will ask thee what they are to expend in alms: say, 'Whatsoever good ye expend it should be for parents and kinsmen, and the orphan and the poor, and the son of the road; and whatsoever good ye do, verily, of it God knows
Prescribed for you is fighting, but it is hateful to you. Yet peradventure that ye hate a thing while it is good for you, and peradventure that ye love a thing while it is bad for you; God knows, and ye,- ye do not know
They will ask thee of the sacred month,- of fighting therein. Say, 'Fighting therein is a great sin; but turning folks off God's way, and misbelief in Him and in the Sacred Mosque, and turning His people out therefrom, is a greater in God's sight; and sedition is a greater sin than slaughter.' They will not cease from fighting you until they turn you from your religion if they can; but whosoever of you is turned from his religion and dies while still a misbeliever; these are those whose works are vain in this world and the next; they are the fellows of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein for aye
Verily, those who believe, and those who flee, and those who wage war in God's way; these may hope for God's mercy, for God is forgiving and merciful
They will ask thee about wine and el maisar, say, 'In them both is sin and profit to men; but the sin of both is greater than the profit of the same.' They will ask thee what they shall expend in alms: say, 'The surplus.' Thus does God manifest to you His signs; haply ye may reflect on this world and the next
They will ask thee about orphans: say, 'To do good to them is best.' But if ye interfere with them - they are your brethren, and God knows the evildoer from the well doer; and if God will He will surely trouble you. Verily, God is mighty, wise
Wed not with idolatrous women until they believe, for surely a believing handmaid is better than an idolatrous woman, even though she please you. And wed not to idolatrous men until they believe, for a believing slave is better than an idolater, even though he please you. Those invite you to the fire, but God invites you to paradise and pardon by His permission, and makes clear His signs to men; haply they may remember
They will ask thee about menstruation: say, 'It is a hurt.' So keep apart from women in their menstruation, and go not near them till they be cleansed; but when they are cleansed come in to them by where God has ordered you verily, God loves those who turn to Him, and those who keep themselves clean
Your women are your tilth, so come into your tillage how you choose; but do a previous good act for yourselves, and fear God, and know that ye are going to meet Him; and give good tidings unto those who do believe
Make not God the butt of your oaths, that ye will keep clear and fear and make peace amongst men, for God both hears and knows

Those who swear off from their women, they must wait four months; but if they break their vow God is forgiving and merciful
And if they intend to divorce them, verily, God hears and knows
Divorced women must wait for themselves three courses; and it is not lawful to them that they hide what God has created in their wombs, if they believe in God and in the last day. Their husbands will do better to take them back in that (case) if they wish for reconciliation; for, the same is due to them as from them; but the men should have precedence over them. God is mighty and wise
Divorce (may happen) twice; then keep them in reason, or let them go with kindness. It is not lawful for you to take from them anything of what you have given them, unless both fear that they cannot keep within God's bounds. So if ye fear that ye cannot keep within God's bounds there is no crime in you both about what she ransoms herself with. These are God's bounds, do not transgress them; and whoso transgresses God's bounds, they it is who are unjust
But if he divorce her (a third time) she shall not be lawful to him after that, until she marry another husband; but, if he divorce her too, it is no crime in them both to come together again, if they think that they can keep within God's bounds. These are God's bounds which He explains to a people who know
When ye divorce women, and they have reached the prescribed time, then keep them kindly, or let them go in reason, but do not keep them by force to transgress; for whoso does that, he is unjust to his own soul: and do not take God's signs in jest; and remember God's favours to you, and what He has sent down to you of the Book and wisdom, to admonish you thereby; and fear God, and know that God doth all things know
When ye divorce women, and they have reached their prescribed term, do not prevent them from marrying their (fresh) husbands, when they have agreed with each other reasonably. That is what he is admonished with who amongst you believes in God and in the last day. That is more pure for you and cleaner. But God knows, and ye know not
Mothers must suckle their children two whole years for one who wishes to complete the time of suckling; and on him to whom it is born its sustenance and clothing are incumbent; but in reason, for no soul shall be obliged beyond its capacity. A mother shall not be forced for her child; nor he to whom it is born for his child. And the same (is incumbent) on the heir (of the father). But if both parties wish to wean, by mutual consent and counsel, then it is no crime in them. And if ye wish to provide a wet-nurse for your children, it is no crime in you when you pay what you have promised her, in reason. Fear God, and know that God on what ye do doth look
Those of you who die and leave wives behind, let these wait by themselves for four months and ten days; and when they have reached their prescribed time, there is no crime in them for what they do with themselves in reason; for God of what ye do is well aware
Nor is there any crime in you for that ye make them an offer of marriage, or that ye keep it secret, in your minds. God knows that ye will remember them; but do not propose to them in secret, unless ye speak a reasonable speech; and resolve not on marriage tie until the Book shall reach its time; but know that God knows what is in your souls; so beware! and know that God is forgiving and clement
It is no crime in you if ye divorce your women ere you have yet touched them, or settled for them a settlement. But provide maintenance for them; the wealthy according to his power, and the straitened in circumstances according to his power, must provide, in reason;- a duty this upon the kind
And if ye divorce them before ye have touched them, but have already settled for them a settlement; the half of what ye have settled, unless they remit it, or he in whose hand is the marriage tie remits it; and that ye should remit is nearer to piety, and forget not liberality between you. Verily, God on what ye do doth look
Observe the prayers, and the middle prayer, and stand ye attent before God
And if ye fear, then afoot or on horseback; but when ye are in safety remember God, how He taught you while yet ye did not know
Those of you who die and leave wives, should bequeath to their wives maintenance for a year, without expulsion (from their home); but if they go out, there is no crime in you for what they do of themselves, in reason; but God is mighty and wise
And divorced women should have a maintenance in reason,- a duty this on those that fear
Thus does God explain to you His signs; haply ye may understand
Dost thou not look at those who left their homes by thousands, for fear of death; and God said to them 'Die,' and then He quickened them again? Verily God is Lord of grace to men, but most men give no thanks
Fight then in God's way, and know that God both hears and knows
Who is there that will lend to God a good loan? He will redouble it many a double; God closes His hand and holds it out, and unto Him shall ye return
Dost thou not look at the crowd of the children of Israel after Moses time, when they said to a prophet of theirs, 'Raise up for us a king, and we will fight in God's way?' He said, 'Will ye perhaps, if it be written down for you to fight, refuse to fight?' They said, ' And why should we not fight in God's way, now that we are dispossessed of our homes and sons?' But when it was written down for them to fight they turned back, save a few of them, and God knows who are evildoers
Then their prophet said to them, 'Verily, God has raised up for you Talut as a king;' they said, 'How can the kingdom be his over us; we have more right to the kingdom than he, for he has not an amplitude of wealth?' He said, 'Verily, God has chosen him over you, and has provided him with an extent of knowledge and of form. God gives the kingdom unto whom He will; God comprehends and knows
Then said to them their prophet, 'The sign of his kingdom is that there shall come to you the ark with the shechina in it from your Lord, and the relics of what the family of Moses and the family of Aaron left; the angels shall bear it.' In that is surely a sign to you if ye believe
And when Talut set out with his soldiery, he said, 'God will try you with a river, and he who drinks therefrom, he is not of mine; but whoso tastes it not, he is of mine, save he who laps it lapping with his hand.' And they drank from it save a few of them, and when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said, 'We have no power this day against Galut and his soldiery,' those who thought that they should meet their Lord said, 'How many a small division of men have conquered a numerous division, by the permission of God, for God is with the patient
And when they went out against a Galut and his soldiery, they said, 'Lord, pour out patience over us, and make firm our steps, and help us against the misbelieving people
And they put them to flight by the permission of God, and David killed Galut, and God gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of what He willed. And were it not for God's repelling men one with another the earth would become spoiled; but God is Lord of grace over the worlds
These are the signs of God, we recite them to thee in truth, for, verily, thou art of those who are sent
These apostles have we preferred one of them above another. Of them is one to whom God spake; and we have raised some of them degrees; and we have given Jesus the son of Mary manifest signs, and strengthened him by the Holy Spirit. And, did God please, those who came after them would not have fought after there came to them manifest signs. But they did disagree, and of them are some who believe, and of them some who misbelieve, but, did God please, they would not have fought, for God does what He will
O ye who believe! expend in alms of what we have bestowed upon you, before the day comes in which is no barter, and no friendship, and no intercession; and the misbelievers, they are the unjust
God, there is no god but He, the living, the self-subsistent. Slumber takes Him not, nor sleep. His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth. Who is it that intercedes with Him save by His permission? He knows what is before them and what behind them, and they comprehend not aught of His knowledge but of what He pleases. His throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and it tires Him not to guard them both, for He is high and grand
There is no compulsion in religion; the right way has been distinguished from the wrong, and whoso disbelieves in Taghut and believes in God, he has got hold of the firm handle in which is no breaking off; but God both hears and knows
God is the patron of those who believe, He brings them forth from darkness into light. But those who misbelieve, their patrons are Taghut, these bring them forth from light to darkness,- fellows of the Fire, they dwell therein for aye
Do you not look at him who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, that God had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said, 'My Lord is He who giveth life and death,' he said, 'I give life and death.' Abraham said, 'But verily, God brings the sun from the east, do thou then bring it from the west?' And he who misbelieved was dumbfounded, for God does not guide unjust folk
Or like him who passed by a village, when it was desolate and turned over on its roofs, and said, 'How will God revive this after its death?' And God made him die for a hundred years, then He raised him, and said, 'How long hast thou tarried?' Said he, 'I have tarried a day, or some part of a day.' He said, 'Nay, thou hast tarried a hundred years; look at thy food and drink, they are not spoiled, and look at thine ass; for we will make thee a sign to men. And look at the bones how we scatter them and then clothe them with flesh.' And when it was made manifest to him, he said, 'I know that God is mighty over all
And when Abraham said, 'Lord, show me how thou wilt revive the dead,' He said, 'What, dost thou not yet believe?' Said he, 'Yea, but that my heart may be quieted.' He said, 'Then take four birds, and take them close to thyself; then put a part of them on every mountain; then call them, and they will come to thee in haste; and know that God is mighty, wise
The likeness of those who expend their wealth in God's way is as the likeness of a grain that grows to seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains, for God will double unto whom He pleases; for God both embraces and knows
Those who expend their wealth in God's way, then do not follow up what they expend by taunting with it and by annoyance, these have their hire with their Lord, and no fear is on them, neither shall they grieve
Kind speech and pardon are better than almsgiving followed by annoyance, and God is rich and clement
O ye who believe! make not your almsgiving vain by taunts and annoyance, like him who expends what he has for the sake of appearances before men, and believes not in God and the last day; for his likeness is as the likeness of a flint with soil upon it, and a heavy shower falls on it and leaves it bare rock; they can do nought with what they earn, for God guides not the misbelieving folk
But the likeness of those who expend their wealth craving the goodwill of God, and as an insurance for their souls, is as the likeness of a garden on a hill. A heavy shower falls on it, and it brings forth its eatables twofold; and if no heavy shower falls on it, the dew does; and God on what ye do doth look
Would one of you fain have a garden of palms and vines, with rivers flowing beneath it, in which is every fruit; and when old age shall reach him, have weak seed, and there fall on it a storm wind with fire therein, and it gets burnt? Thus does God manifest to you His signs, mayhap ye will reflect
O ye who believe! expend in alms of the good things that ye have earned, and of what we have brought forth for you out of the earth, and do not take the vile thereof to spend in alms,- what you would not take yourselves save by connivance at it; but know that God is rich and to be praised
The devil promises you poverty and bids you sin, but God promises you pardon from Him and grace, for God both embraces and knows
He bringeth wisdom unto whom He will, and he who is brought wisdom is brought much good; but none will remember save those endowed with minds
Whatever expense ye expend, or vow ye vow, God knows it; but the unjust have no helpers
If ye display your almsgiving, then well is it; but if ye hide it and bring it to the poor, then is it better for you, and will expiate for you your evil deeds; for God of what ye do is well aware
Thou art not bound to guide them; but God guides whom He will; and whatever good ye expend it is for yourselves, and do not expend save craving for God's face. And what ye expend of good, it shall be repaid you, and ye shall not be wronged
unto the poor who are straitened in God's way, and cannot knock about in the earth. The ignorant think them to be rich because of their modesty; you will know them by their mark, they do not beg from men importunately; but what ye spend of good God knows
Those who expend their wealth by night and day, secretly and openly, they shall have their hire with their Lord. No fear shall come on them, nor shall they grieve
Those who devour usury shall not rise again, save as he riseth whom Satan hath paralysed with a touch; and that is because they say 'selling is only like usury,' but God has made selling lawful and usury unlawful; and he to whom the admonition from his Lord has come, if he desists, what has gone before is his: his matter is in God's hands. But whosoever returns (to usury) these are the fellows of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein for aye
God shall blot out usury, but shall make almsgiving profitable, for God loves not any sinful misbeliever
Verily, those who believe, and act righteously, and are steadfast in prayer, and give alms, theirs is their hire with their Lord; there is no fear on them, nor shall they grieve
O ye who believe! fear God, and remit the balance of usury, if ye be believers
and if ye will not do it, then hearken to the proclamation of war from God and His Apostle; but if ye repent, your capital is yours. Ye shall not wrong, nor shall ye be wronged
And if it be one in difficulties, then wait for easy circumstances; but that ye remit it as alms is better for you, if ye did but know
Fear the day wherein ye shall return to God; then shall each soul be paid what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged
O ye who believe! if ye engage to one another in a debt for a stated time, then write it down, and let a scribe write it down between you faithfully; nor let a scribe refuse to write as God taught him, but let him write, and let him who owes dictate; but let him fear God his Lord, and not diminish therefrom aught; but if he who owes be a fool, or weak, or cannot dictate himself, then let his agent dictate faithfully, and let them call two witnesses out from amongst their men; or if there be not two men, then a man and two women, from those whom he chooses for witnesses, so that if one of the two should err, the second of the two may remind the other; and let not the witnesses refuse when they are summoned; and let them not tire of writing it, be it small or great, with its time of payment. That is more just in the sight of God, and more upright for testimony, and brings you nearer to not doubting. Unless, indeed, it be a ready-money transaction between you, which ye arrange between yourselves, then it is no crime against you that ye do not write it down; but bring witnesses to what ye sell one to another, and let not either scribe or witness come to harm, for if ye do it will be abomination in you; but fear God, for God teaches you, and God knows all things
But if ye be upon a journey, and ye cannot find a scribe, then let a pledge be taken. But if one of you trust another, then let him who is trusted surrender his trust, and let him fear God his Lord, and conceal not testimony, for he who conceals it, verily, sinful is his heart: God knows what ye do
God's is what is in heaven and in the earth, and if ye show what is in your souls, or hide it, God will call you to account; and He forgives whom He will, and punishes whom He will, for God is mighty over all
The Apostle believes in what is sent down to him from his Lord, and the believers all believe on God, and His angels, and His Books, and His apostles,- we make no difference between any of His apostles,- they say, 'We hear and obey, Thy pardon, O Lord! for to Thee our journey tends
God will not require of the soul save its capacity. It shall have what it has earned, and it shall owe what has been earned from it. Lord, catch us not up, if we forget or make mistake; Lord, load us not with a burden, as Thou hast loaded those who were before us. Lord, make us not to carry what we have not strength for, but forgive us, and pardon us, and have mercy on us. Thou art our Sovereign, then help us against the people who do not believe
ALIF LAM MIM
God, there is no god but He, the living, the self-subsistent
He has sent down to thee the Book, in truth, confirming what was before it, and has revealed the law, and the gospel
before for the guidance of men, and has revealed the Discrimination. Verily, those who disbelieve in the signs of God, for them is severe torment, for God is mighty and avenging
Verily, God, there is nothing hidden from Him in the earth, nor in the heaven
He it is who fashions you in the womb as He pleases. There is no God but He, the mighty, the wise
He it is who has revealed to thee the Book, of which there are some verses that are decisive, they are the mother of the Book; and others ambiguous; but as for those in whose hearts is perversity, they follow what is ambiguous, and do crave for sedition, craving for (their own) interpretation of it; but none know the interpretation of it except God. But those who are well grounded in knowledge say, 'We believe in it; it is all from our Lord; but none will remember save those who possess minds
O Lord! pervert not our hearts again when Thou hast guided them, and grant us mercy from Thee, for Thou art He who grants
O Lord! Thou shalt gather together men unto the day wherein is no doubt. Verily, God will not depart from His promise
Verily, those who misbelieve, their wealth shall not help them, nor their children, against God at all; and they it is who are the fuel of the fire
As was the wont of Pharaoh's people, and those before them, they said our signs were lies, and God caught them up in their sins, for God is severe to punish
Say to those who misbelieve, 'Ye shall be overcome and driven together to hell, an ill couch will it be
Ye have had a sign in the two parties who met; one party fighting in the way of God, the other misbelieving; these saw twice the same number as themselves to the eye-sight, for God aids with His help those whom He pleases.' Verily, in that is a lesson for those who have perception
Seemly unto men is a life of lusts, of women, and children, and hoarded talents of gold and silver, and of horses well-bred, and cattle, and tilth;- that is the provision for the life of this world; but God, with Him is the best resort
Say, 'But shall we tell you of a better thing than this?' For those who fear are gardens with their Lord, beneath which rivers flow; they shall dwell therein for aye, and pure wives and grace from God; the Lord looks on His servants
who say, 'Lord, we believe, pardon Thou our sins and keep us from the torment of the fire
the patient, the truthful, the devout, and those who ask for pardon at the dawn
God bears witness that there is no god but He, and the angels, and those possessed of knowledge standing up for justice. There is no God but He, the mighty, the wise
Verily, (the true) religion in God's sight is Islam, and those to whom the Book was given disagreed not until after that there was given to them knowledge, through mutual envy. But whoso disbelieves in God's signs, truly God is quick at reckoning up
And if they would dispute with thee, then say, 'I turn my face with resignation unto God, and whoso follows me.' And say to those who have been given the Book, unto the Gentiles, 'Are ye, too, resigned' and if they are resigned, then are they guided. But if they turn their backs, then thou hast only to preach, and God looks on his servants
Verily, those who disbelieve in God's signs, and kill the prophets without right, and kill those from among men, who bid what is just,- to them give the glad tidings of grievous woe
These are they whose works are void in this world and the next, and helpers have they none
Did ye not see those who have been given a portion of the Book? they were called unto the Book of God to decide between them; and then a sect of them turned their backs and turned away
that is because they say the fire shall not touch us save for a certain number of days. But that deceived them in their religion which they had invented
How will it be when we have gathered them together for a day whereof there is no doubt, when each soul shall be paid what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged
Say, 'O God, Lord of the kingdom! Thou givest the kingdom to whomsoever Thou pleasest, and strippest the kingdom from whomsoever Thou pleasest; Thou honourest whom Thou pleasest, and abasest whom Thou pleasest; in Thy hand is good. Verily, Thou art mighty over all
Thou dost turn night to day, and dost turn day to night, and dost bring forth the living from the dead, and dost provide for whom Thou pleasest without taking count
Those who believe shall not take misbelievers for their patrons, rather than believers, and he who does this has no part with God at all, unless, indeed, ye fear some danger from them. But God bids you beware of Himself, for unto Him your journey is
Say, 'If ye hide that which is in your breasts, or if ye show it, God knows it: He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, for God is mighty over all
The day that every soul shall find what it has done of good present before it; and what it has done of evil, it would fain that there were between itself and that a wide interval. 'God bids you beware of Himself, but God is gentle with His servants
Say, 'If ye would love God then follow me, and God will love you and forgive you your sins, for God is forgiving and merciful
Say, 'Obey God and the Apostle; but if ye turn your backs God loves not misbelievers
Verily, God has chosen Adam, and Noah, and Abraham's people, and Imran's people above the world
a seed, of which one succeeds the other, but God both hears and knows
When Imran's wife said, 'Lord! I have vowed to Thee what is within my womb, to be dedicated unto Thee, receive it then from me. Verily, Thou dost hear and know
And when she brought it forth she said, 'Verily, I have brought it forth a female' - but God knew best what she brought forth; and a male is not like a female - 'I have called her Mary, and I seek a refuge in Thee for her and for her seed from Satan the pelted
And her Lord received her with a good reception, and made her grow up with a good growth, and Zachariah took care of her. Whenever Zachariah entered the chamber to her he found beside her a provision, and said, 'O Mary, how hast thou this?' She said, 'It is from God, for God provides for whom He pleases without count
Therefore prayed Zachariah to his Lord, and said, 'Lord, grant me from Thee a good seed. Verily, Thou hearest prayer
And an angel cried out to him as he was standing praying in the chamber (and said) that 'God gives thee the glad tidings of John, to confirm the Word from God,- of a chief and a chaste one, and a prophet from amongst the righteous
He said, 'My Lord, how can there be to me a boy when old age has reached me, and my wife is barren?' Said he, 'Thus God does what He pleaseth
He said, 'My Lord, make for me a sign.' He said, 'Thy sign is that thou shalt not speak to men for three days, save by gesture; but remember thy Lord much, and celebrate His praises in the evening and the morning
And when the angels said, 'O Mary! verily, God has chosen thee, and has purified thee, and has chosen thee above the women of the world
O Mary! be devout unto thy Lord, and adore and bow down with those who bow
That is (one) of the declarations of the unseen world which we reveal to thee, though thou wert not by them when they threw their lots which of them should take care of Mary, nor were ye by them when they did dispute
When the angel said, 'O Mary! verily, God gives thee the glad tidings of a Word from Him; his name shall be the Messiah Jesus the son of Mary, regarded in this world and the next and of those whose place is nigh to God
And he shall speak to people in his cradle, and when grown up, and shall be among the righteous
She said, 'Lord! how can I have a son, when man has not yet touched me?' He said, 'Thus God creates what He pleaseth. When He decrees a matter He only says BE and it is
and He will teach him the Book, and wisdom, and the law, and the gospel
and he shall be a prophet to the people of Israel (saying), that I have come to you, with a sign from God, namely, that I will create for you out of clay as though it were the form of a bird, and I will blow thereon and it shall become a bird by God's permission; and I will heal the blind from birth, and lepers; and I will bring the dead to life by God's permission; and I will tell you what you eat and what ye store up in your houses. Verily, in that is a sign for you if ye be believers
And I will confirm what is before you of the law, and will surely make lawful for you some of that which was prohibited from you. I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and follow me
for God is my Lord, and your Lord, so worship Him:- this is the right path
And when Jesus perceived their unbelief, He said, 'Who are my helpers for God?' Said the apostles, 'We are God's helpers. We believe in God, so bear witness that we are resigned
Lord, we have believed in what Thou hast revealed, and we have followed the Apostle, so write us down with those which bear witness
But they (the Jews) were crafty, and God was crafty, for God is the best of crafty ones
When God said, 'O Jesus! I will make Thee die and take Thee up again to me and will clear thee of those who misbelieve, and will make those who follow thee above those who misbelieve, at the day of judgment, then to me is your return. I will decide between you concerning that wherein ye disagree
And as for those who misbelieve, I will punish them with grievous punishment in this world and the next, and they shall have none to help them
But as for those who believe and do what is right, He will pay them their reward, for God loves not the unjust
That is what we recite to thee of the signs and of the wise reminder
Verily the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam. He created him from earth, then He said to him BE, and he was
the truth from thy Lord, so be thou not of those who are in doubt
And whoso disputeth with thee after what has come to thee of knowledge, say, 'Come, let us call our sons and your sons, and our women and your women, and ourselves and yourselves: then we will imprecate and put God's curse on those who lie
Verily, those are the true stories, and there is no god but God, and, verily, God He is the mighty, the wise
but if they turn back, God knows the evildoers
Say, 'O ye people of the Book, come to a word laid down plainly between us and you, that we will not serve other than God, nor associate aught with him, nor take each other for lords rather than God.' But if they turn back then say, 'Bear witness that we are resigned
O people of the Book, why do ye dispute about Abraham, when the law and the gospel were not revealed until after him? What! do ye not understand
Here ye are, disputing about what ye have some knowledge of; why then do ye dispute about what ye have no knowledge of? God knows and ye know not
Abraham was not a Jew, nor yet a Christian, but he was a `Hanif resigned, and not of the idolaters
Verily, the people most worthy of Abraham are those who follow him and his prophets, and those who believe;- God is the patron of the believers
A sect of the people of the Book would fain they could lead you astray, but they only lead themselves astray, and they do not perceive
O people of the Book! why do ye disbelieve in the signs of God, the while ye witness them
O people of the Book! why do ye clothe the truth with falsehood and hide the truth the while ye know
A sect of the people of the Book say, 'Believe in what was revealed to those who believed at the first appearance of the day, and disbelieve it at the end thereof,' - that (others) may perchance go back (from their faith)
do not believe save one who followeth your religion.' Say, 'Verily, the (true) guidance is the guidance of God, that one should be given like what ye are given.' Or would they dispute with you before your Lord, say, 'Grace is in the hand of God, He gives it to whom he pleases, for God both comprehends and knows
He specially favours with his mercy whom he pleases, for God is Lord of mighty grace
And of the people of the Book, there are some of them who, if thou entrust them with a talent give it back to you; and some of them, if thou entrust them with a dinar, he will not give it back to thee except so long as thou dost stand over him. That is because they say, We owe no duty to the Gentiles;' but they tell a lie against God, the while they know
Yea, whoso fulfils his covenant and fears,- verily, God loves those who fear
Those who sell God's covenant and their oaths for a little price, these have no portion in the future life. God will not speak to them, and will not look upon them on the resurrection day, and will not purify them; but for them is grievous woe
And, verily, amongst them is a sect who twist their tongues concerning the Book, that ye may reckon it to be from the Book, but it is not from the Book. They say, 'It is from God,' but it is not from God, and they tell a lie against God, the while they know
It is not right for a man that God should give him a Book, and judgment, and prophecy, and that then he should say to men, 'Be ye servants of mine rather than of God;' but be ye rather masters of teaching the Book and of what ye learn
He does not bid you take the angels and the prophets for your lords; shall He bid you misbelieve again when you are once resigned
And when God took the compact from the prophets '(this is) surely what we have given you of the Book and wisdom. Then shall come to you the Apostle confirming what is with you. Ye must believe in him and help him.' He said, moreover, 'Are ye resolved and have ye taken my compact on that (condition).' They say, 'We are resolved.' He said, 'Then bear witness, for I am witness with you
but he who turns back after that, these are sinners
What is it other than God's religion that they crave? when to Him is resigned whosoever is in the heavens and the earth, will he or nill he, and to him shall they return
Say, 'We believe in God, and what has been revealed to thee, and what was revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and what was given to Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord,- we will make no distinction between any of them,- and we are unto Him resigned
Whosoever craves other than Islam for a religion, it shall surely not be accepted from him, and he shall, in the next world, be of those who lose
How shall God guide people who have disbelieved after believing and bearing witness that the Apostle is true, and after there come to them manifest signs? God guides the unjust folk
These, their reward is, that on them is the curse of God, and of the angels, and of men together
they shall dwell therein for aye - the torment shall not be alleviated from them, nor shall they be respited
save those who repent after that, and act aright, for verily, God is forgiving and merciful
Verily, those who misbelieve after believing, and then increase in misbelief, their repentance shall not be accepted; these are those who err
Verily, those who misbelieve and die in misbelief, there shall not be accepted from any one of them the earth-full of gold, though he should give it as a ransom. For them is grievous woe, and helpers have they none
Ye cannot attain to righteousness until ye expend in alms of what ye love. But what ye expend in alms, that God knows
All food was lawful to the children of Israel save what Israel made unlawful to himself before that the law was revealed. Say, 'Bring the law and recite it, if ye speak the truth
But whoso forges against God a lie, after that, they are the unjust
Say, 'God speaks the truth, then follow the faith of Abraham, a `hanif, who was not of the idolaters
Verily, the first House founded for men was surely that at Bekkah, for a blessing and a guidance to the worlds
Therein are manifest signs,- Abraham's station, and whosoever enters in is safe. There is due to God from man a pilgrimage unto the House, for whosoever can find his way there. But whoso misbelieves - God is independent of the worlds
Say, 'O people of the Book! why do ye misbelieve in God's signs, while God is witness of what ye do
Say, 'O people of the Book! why do ye turn from the way of God him who believes, craving to make it crooked, while ye are witnesses? But God is not careless of what ye do
O ye who believe! if ye obey the sect of those to whom the Book was brought, they will turn you, after your faith, to unbelievers again
How can ye misbelieve while unto you are recited the signs of God, and among you is His Apostle? But whoso takes tight hold on God, he is guided into the right way
O ye who believe! fear God with the fear that He deserves, and die not save ye be resigned
Take tight hold of God's rope altogether, and do not part in sects; but remember the favours of God towards you, when ye were enemies and He made friendship between your hearts, and on the morrow ye were, by His favour, brothers. Ye were on the edge of a pit of fire, but he rescued you therefrom. Thus does God show to you His signs, perchance ye may be guided
and that there may be of you a nation who shall invite to good, and bid what is reasonable, and forbid what is wrong; these are the prosperous
Be not like those who parted in sects and disagreed after there came to them manifest signs; for them is mighty woe
on the day when faces shall be whitened and faces shall be blackened. As for those whose faces are blackened,- 'Did ye misbelieve after your faith, then taste the torment for your misbelief
But as for those whose faces are whitened, they are in God's mercy, and they shall dwell therein for aye
These are the signs of God. We recite them to you in truth, for God desires not wrong unto the worlds
God's is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and unto God affairs return
Ye were the best of nations brought forth unto man. Ye bid what is reasonable, and forbid what is wrong, believing in God. Had the people of the Book believed, it would have been better for them. There are believers among them, though most of them are sinners
They shall surely not harm you save a hurt; and if they fight you, they shall show you their backs, then they shall not be helped
They are smitten with abasement wherever they be found, save for the rope of God and the rope of man; and they draw on themselves wrath from God. They are smitten, too, with poverty; that is because they did disbelieve in God's signs, and kill the prophets undeservedly. That is because they did rebel and did transgress
They are not all alike. Of the people of the Book there is a nation upright, reciting God's signs throughout the night, as they adore the while
They believe in God, and in the last day, and bid what is reasonable, and forbid what is wrong, and vie in charity; these are among the righteous
What ye do of good surely God will not deny, for God knows those who fear
Verily, those who misbelieve, their wealth is of no service to them, nor their children either, against God; they are the fellows of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein for aye
The likeness of what they expend in this life of the world, is as the likeness of wind wherein is a cold blast that falls upon a people's tilth who have wronged themselves and destroys it. It is not God who wrongs them, but it is themselves they wrong
O ye who believe! take not to intimacy with others than yourselves; they will not fail to spoil you; they would fain ye came to trouble,- hatred is shown by their mouths; but what their breasts conceal is greater still. We have made manifest to you our signs, did ye but understand
Ye it is who love them, but they love not you; and ye believe in the Book, all of it. But when they meet you they say, 'We believe;' and when they go aside they bite their finger tips at you through rage. Say, 'Die in your rage, for God doth know the nature of men's breasts
If good luck touch you it is bad for them, but if bad luck befall you they rejoice therein; yet if ye are patient and fear, their tricks shall not harm you, for what they do God comprehends
When thou didst set forth early from thy people to settle for the believers a camp to fight;- but God both hears and knows
when two companies of you were on the point of showing cowardice; but God was their guardian, for on God surely the believers do rely
Why! God gave you victory at Bedr when ye were in a poor way; fear God, then, haply ye may give thanks
When thou didst say unto the believers, 'Is it not enough for you that your Lord assists you with three thousand of the angels sent down from on high
Yea, if ye are patient and fear God, and they come upon you on a sudden, now, your Lord will assist you with five thousand of His angels, (angels) of mark
God only made this as glad tidings for you to comfort your hearts withal,- for victory is but from God, the mighty, the wise
to cut off the flank of those who misbelieve, or make them downcast, that they may retire disappointed
Thou hast nothing to do with the affair at all, whether He turn towards them again or punish them; for, verily, they are unjust
God's is what is in the heavens and in the earth. He forgives whom He pleases, and punishes whom He pleases; for God is forgiving and merciful
O ye who believe! devour not usury doubly doubled, but fear God, perchance ye may be prosperous
fear the fire which is prepared for the unbelievers
and obey God and His Apostle, perchance ye may get mercy
And vie with one another for pardon from your Lord, and for Paradise, the breadth of which is as the heaven and the earth, prepared for those who fear
for those who expend in alms, in prosperity and adversity, for those who repress their rage, and those who pardon men; God loves the kind
Those who when they do a crime, or wrong themselves, remember God, and ask forgiveness for their sins,- and who forgives sins save God?- and do not persevere in what they did, the while they know
these have their reward:- pardon from their Lord, and gardens beneath which rivers flow, dwelling therein for aye; for pleasant is the hire of those who act like this
Incidents have passed before your time, go on then in the earth, and see what was the end of those who called (the prophets) liars
This is an explanation unto men, and a guidance and a warning unto those who fear
Do not give way nor grieve, for ye shall have the upper hand if ye but be believers
If a sore touch you, a sore like it has touched people: these are days which we make to alternate amongst mankind that God may know who it is that believe, and may take from you witnesses, for God loves not the unjust
and that God may assay those who believe, and blot out the misbelievers
Do ye think that ye can enter Paradise and God not know those of you who have fought well, or know the patient
Why, ye longed for death before ye met it! Now ye have looked upon it and ye halt
Mohammed is but an apostle; apostles have passed away before his time; what if he die or is killed, will ye retreat upon your heels? He who retreats upon his heels does no harm to God at all; but God will recompense the thankful
It is not for any soul to die, save by God's permission written down for an appointed time; but he who wishes for the reward of this world we will give him of it, and he who wishes for the reward of the future we will give him of it, and we will recompense the grateful
How many prophets have myriads fought against! yet they did not give way at what befel them in God's way Nor were they weak, nor did they demean themselves:- God loves the patient
And their word was only to say, 'Lord, forgive us our sins and our extravagance in our affairs; and make firm our footing, and help us against the misbelieving folk
and God gave them the reward of this world, and good reward for the future too, for God doth love the kind
O ye who believe! if ye obey those who misbelieve, they will turn you back upon your heels, and ye will retreat the losers
Nay, God is your Lord, He is the best of helpers
We will throw dread into the hearts of those who misbelieve, for that they associate that with God which He has sent down no power for; but their resort is fire, and evil is the resort of the unjust
God has truly kept His promise, when ye knocked them senseless by His permission, until ye showed cowardice, and wrangled, and rebelled, after he had shown you what ye loved. Amongst you are those who love this world, and amongst you are those who love the next. Then He turned you away from them to try you; but He has pardoned you, for God is Lord of grace unto believers
when ye went up and looked not round upon any one, although the Apostle was calling you from your rear. Therefore did God reward you with trouble on trouble that ye should not grieve after what ye had missed, nor for what befel you, for God is well aware of what ye do
Then He sent down upon you after trouble safety,- drowsiness creeping over one company of you, and one company of you getting anxious about themselves, suspecting about God other than the truth, with the suspicion of the ignorant, and saying, 'Have we any chance in the affair?' Say, 'Verily, the affair is God's.' They conceal in themselves what they will not show to thee, and say, 'If we had any chance in the affair we should not be killed here.' Say, 'If ye were in your houses, surely those against whom slaughter was written down, would have gone forth to fight even to where they are lying now; that God may try what is in your breasts and assay what is in your hearts, for God doth know the nature of men's breasts
Verily, those of you who turned your backs on that day when the two armies met, it was but Satan who made them slip for something they had earned. But God has now pardoned them; verily, God is forgiving and clement
O ye who believe! be not like those who misbelieve, and say unto their brethren when they knock about in the earth, or are upon a raid, 'Had they but been at home, they had not died and had not been killed.' It was that God might make a sighing in their hearts, for God gives life and death; and God on what ye do doth look
And if, indeed, ye be killed in God's way or die, surely forgiveness from God and mercy is better than what ye gather
and if ye die or be killed it is to God ye shall be assembled
It was by a sort of mercy from God thou didst deal gently with them, for hadst thou been rough and rude of heart they had dispersed from around thee. But pardon them, and ask forgiveness for them, and take counsel with them in the affair. As for what thou hast resolved, rely upon God; verily, God loves those who do rely
If God help you, there is none can overcome you; but if He leave you in the lurch, who is there can help you after Him? Upon God then let believers rely
It is not for the prophet to cheat; and he who cheats shall bring what he has cheated on the resurrection day. Then shall each soul be paid what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged
Is he who follows the pleasure of God, like him who has drawn on himself anger from God, whose resort is hell? An evil journey shall it be
These are degrees with God, and God sees what ye do
God was surely very gracious to the believers, when He sent amongst them an apostle from themselves, to recite to them His signs, and purify them, and teach them the Book and wisdom, although they surely were before his time in manifest error
Or when an accident befals you, and ye have fallen on twice as much, ye say, 'How is this?' Say, 'It is from yourselves. Verily, God is mighty over all
And what befell you the day when the two armies met, it was by God's permission; that He might know the believers
and might know those who behaved hypocritically; for it was said to them, 'Come, fight in God's way,' or 'repel (the foe);' they said, 'If we knew how to fight we would surely follow you.' They were that day far nigher unto misbelief than they were to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, but God doth know best what they hid
Those who said of their brethren, whilst they themselves stayed at home, 'Had they obeyed us they would not have been killed.' Say, 'Ward off from yourselves death, if ye do speak the truth
Count not those who are killed in the way of God as dead, but living with their Lord;- provided for
rejoicing in what God has brought them of His grace, and being glad for those who have not reached them yet,- those left behind them; there is no fear for them, and they shall not be grieved
glad at favour from God and grace, and that God wasteth not the hire of the believers
Whoso answered to the call of God and of His prophet after sorrow had befallen them, for those, if they do good and fear God, is a mighty hire
To whom when men said, 'Verily, men have gathered round you, fear then them,' it only increased their faith, and they said, 'God is enough for us, a good guardian is He
Then they retired in favour from God and grace; no evil touched them; they followed the pleasure of God, and God is Lord of mighty grace
It is only that Satan who frightens his friends. Do not ye fear them, but fear me, if ye be believers
Let them not grieve thee who vie with each other in misbelief. Verily, they cannot hurt God at all. God wills not to make for them a portion in the future life; but for them is mighty woe
Verily, those who purchase misbelief for faith, they do not hurt God at all, and for them is grievous woe
Let not those who misbelieve reckon that our letting them range is good for themselves. We only let them have their range that they may increase in sin. And for them is shameful woe
God would not leave believers in the state which ye are in, until He discerns the vile from the good. And God would not inform you of the unseen, but God chooses of His apostles whom He pleases. Wherefore believe ye in God and His Apostle; and if ye believe and fear, for you is mighty hire
And let not those who are niggard of what God has given them of His grace, count that it is best for them;- nay, it is worse for them. What they have been niggard of shall be a collar round their necks upon the resurrection day. And God's is the heritage of the heavens and the earth, and God of what ye do is well aware
God heard the speech of those who said, 'Verily, God is poor and we are rich.' We will write down what they said, and how they killed the prophets undeservedly, and say, 'Taste ye the torment of burning
this shall they suffer for what their hands have sent on before;- for, verily, God is no unjust one to His servants
who say, 'Verily, God has covenanted with us that we should not believe in an apostle until he gives us a sacrifice which fire devours.' Say, 'There have come to you apostles before me with manifest signs, and with what ye talk about; why then did ye kill them, if ye speak the truth
And if they did call thee a liar, apostles before thee have been called liars too, who came with manifest signs, and with scriptures, and with the illuminating Book
Every soul must taste of death; and ye shall only be paid your hire upon the resurrection day. But he who is forced away from the fire and brought into Paradise is indeed happy; but the life of this world is but a possession of deceit
Ye shall surely be tried in your wealth, and in your persons, and ye shall surely hear from those who have had the Book brought them before you, and from those who associate others with God, much harm. But if ye be patient and fear,- verily, that is one of the determined affairs
When God took the compact from those who have had the Book brought them that 'Ye shall of a surety manifest it unto men, and not hide it,' they cast it behind their backs, and bought therewith a little price,- but evil is what they buy
Count not that those who rejoice in what they have produced, and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not that they are in safety from woe,- for them is grievous woe
God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and God is mighty over all
Verily, in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the succession of night and day, are signs to those possessed of minds
who remember God standing and sitting or lying on their sides, and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth. 'O Lord! thou hast not created this in vain. We celebrate Thy praise; then keep us from the torment of the fire
Lord! verily, whomsoever Thou hast made to enter the fire, Thou hast disgraced him; and the unjust shall have none to help them
Lord! verily, we heard a crier calling to the faith, "Believe in your Lord," and we did believe. Lord! forgive us our sins and cover our offences, and let us die with the righteous
Lord! and bring us what Thou hast promised us by Thy apostles, and disgrace us not upon the resurrection day; for, verily, Thou dost not break Thy promises
And the Lord shall answer them, 'I waste not the works of a worker amongst you, be it male or female,- one of you is from the other. 'Those who fled, and were turned out of their houses, and were harmed in my way, and who fought and were killed, I will cover their offences, and I will make them enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow.' A reward from God; for God, with Him are the best of rewards
Let it not deceive you that those who misbelieve go to and fro in the earth
It is a slight possession, and then their resort is Hell; an evil couch shall it be
But those who fear their Lord, for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall dwell therein for aye,- an entertainment from God; and that which is with God is best for the righteous
Verily, of the people of the Book are some who do believe in God, and in what has been revealed to you, and what was revealed to them, humbling themselves before God, and selling not the signs of God for a little price. These shall have their reward with their Lord; verily, God is quick at reckoning up
O ye who believe! be patient and vie in being patient, and be on the alert, and fear God, that haply ye may prosper
O ye folk! fear your Lord, who created you from one soul, and created therefrom its mate, and diffused from them twain many men and women. And fear God, in whose name ye beg of one another, and the wombs; verily, God over you doth watch
And give unto the orphans their property, and give them not the vile in exchange for the good, and devour not their property to your own property; verily, that were a great sin
But if ye fear that ye cannot do justice between orphans, then marry what seems good to you of women, by twos, or threes, or fours; and if ye fear that ye cannot be equitable, then only one, or what your right hands possess. That keeps you nearer to not being partial
And give women their dowries freely; and if they are good enough to remit any of it of themselves, then devour it with good digestion and appetite
But do not give up to fools their property which God has made you to stand by; but maintain them from it, and clothe them, and speak to them with a reasonable speech
Prove orphans until they reach a marriageable age, and if ye perceive in them right management, then hand over to them their property, and do not devour it extravagantly in anticipation of their growing up. And he who is rich, let him abstain; but he who is poor, let him devour in reason, and when ye hand over to them their property, then take witnesses against them; but God sufficeth for taking account
Men should have a portion of what their parents and kindred leave, and women should have a portion of what their parents and kindred leave, whether it be little or much, a determined portion
And when the next of kin and the orphans and the poor are present at the division, then maintain them out of it, and speak to them a reasonable speech
And let these fear lest they leave behind them a weak seed, for whom they would be afraid; and let them fear God, and speak a straightforward speech
Verily, those who devour the property of orphans unjustly, only devour into their bellies fire, and they shall broil in flames
God instructs you concerning your children; for a male the like of the portion of two females, and if there be women above two, then let them have two-thirds of what (the deceased) leaves; and if there be but one, then let her have a half; and as to the parents, to each of them a sixth of what he leaves, if he has a son; but if he have no son, and his parents inherit, then let his mother have a third, and if he have brethren, let his mother have a sixth after payment of the bequest he bequeaths and of his debt. Your parents or your children, ye know not which of them is nearest to you in usefulness: - an ordinance this from God; verily, God is knowing and wise
And ye shall have half of what your wives leave, if they have no son; but if they have a son, then ye shall have a fourth of what they leave, after payment of the bequests they bequeath or of their debts. And they shall have a fourth of what ye leave, if ye have no son; but if ye have a son, then let them have an eighth of what ye leave, after payment of the bequest ye bequeath and of your debts. And if the man's or the woman's (property) be inherited by a kinsman who is neither parent nor child, and he have a brother or sister, then let each of these two have a sixth; but if they are more than that, let them share in a third after payment of the bequest he bequeaths and of his debts, without prejudice, - an ordinance this from God, and God is knowing and clement
These be God's bounds, and whoso obeys God and the Apostle He will make him enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow, and they shall dwell therein for aye;- that is the mighty happiness
But whoso rebels against God and His Apostle, and transgresses His bounds, He will make him enter into fire, and dwell therein for aye; and for him is shameful woe
Against those of your women who commit adultery, call witnesses four in number from among yourselves; and if these bear witness, then keep the women in houses until death release them, or God shall make for them a way
And if two of you commit it, then hurt them both; but if they turn again and amend, leave them alone, verily, God is easily turned, compassionate
God is only bound to turn again towards those who do evil through ignorance and then turn again. Surely, these will God turn again to, for God is knowing, wise
His turning again is not for those who do evil, until, when death comes before one of them, he says, 'Now I turn again;' nor yet forth those who die in misbelief. For such as these have we prepared a grievous woe
O ye who believe! it is not lawful for you to inherit women's estates against their will; nor to hinder them, that ye may go off with part of what ye brought them, unless they commit fornication manifestly; but associate with them in reason, for if ye are averse from them, it may be that ye are averse from something wherein God has put much good for you
But if ye wish to exchange one wife for another, and have given one of them a talent, then take not from it anything. What! would you take it for a calumny and a manifest crime
How care ye take it when one of you has gone in unto the other, and they have taken from you a rigid compact
And do not marry women your fathers married,- except bygones,- for it is abominable and hateful, and an evil way
unlawful for you are your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your paternal aunts and maternal aunts, and your brother's daughters, and your sister's daughters, and your foster mothers, and your foster sisters, and your wives' mothers, and your step daughters who are your wards, born of your wives to whom ye have gone in; but if ye have not gone in unto them, then it is no crime in you; and the lawful spouses of your sons from your own loins, and that ye form a connexion between two sisters,- except bygones,- verily, God is forgiving, merciful
and married women, save such as your right hands possess,- God's Book against you! - but lawful for you is all besides this, for you to seek them with your wealth, marrying them and not fornicating; but such of them as ye have enjoyed, give them their hire as a lawful due; for there is no crime in you about what ye agree between you after such lawful due, verily, God is knowing and wise
But whosoever of you cannot go the length of marrying marriageable women who believe, then take of what your right hands possess, of your maidens who believe;- though God knows best about your faith. Ye come one from the other; then marry them with the permission of their people, and give them their hire in reason, they being chaste and not fornicating, and not receivers of paramours. But when they are married, if they commit fornication, then inflict upon them half the penalty for married women; that is for whomsoever of you fears wrong; but that ye should have patience is better for you, and God is forgiving and merciful
God wishes to explain to you and to guide you into the ordinances of those who were before you, and to turn towards you, for God is knowing, wise
God wishes to turn towards you, but those who follow their lusts wish that ye should swerve with a mighty swerving
God wishes to make it light for you, for man was created weak
O ye who believe! devour not your property amongst yourselves vainly, unless it be a merchandise by mutual consent. And do not kill yourselves; verily, God is compassionate unto you
But whoso does that maliciously and unjustly, we will broil him with fire; for that is easy with God
If ye avoid great sins from which ye are forbidden, we will cover your offences and make you enter with a noble entrance

who are miserly and bid men be miserly too, and who hide what God has given them of His grace;- but we have prepared for the misbelievers shameful woe

And those who are Jews, and those who pervert the words from their places, and say, 'We hear but we rebel, and do thou listen without hearing,' and (who say) 'rahina,' distorting it with their tongues and taunting about religion., But had they said, 'We hear and we obey, so listen and look upon us,' it would have been better for them and more upright; - but may God curse them in their misbelief, for they will not believe except a few

God, there is no God but He! He will surely assemble you on the resurrection day, there is no doubt therein; who is truer than God in his discourse

save those who reach a people betwixt whom and you is an alliance - or who come to you while their bosoms prevent them from fighting you or fighting their own people.

It is not for a believer to kill a believer save by mistake; and whosoever kills a believer by mistake then let him free a believing neck; and the blood-money must be paid to his people save what they shall remit as alms. But if he be from a tribe hostile to you and yet a believer, then let him free a believing neck. And if it be a tribe betwixt whom and you there is an alliance, then let the blood-money be paid to his friends, and let him free a believing neck; but he who cannot find the means, then let him fast for two consecutive months - a penance this from God, for God is knowing, wise

So were ye aforetime, but God was gracious to you, be ye then discerning; verily, God of what ye do is well aware
Not alike are those of the believers who sit at home without harm, and those who are strenuous in God's way with their wealth and their persons.

degrees from him, and pardon and mercy, for God is forgiving and merciful
Verily, the angels when they took the souls of those who had wronged themselves, said, 'What state were ye in?' they say, 'We were but weak in the earth;' they said, 'Was not God's earth wide enough for you to flee away therein?' These are those whose resort is hell, and a bad journey shall it be
Save for the weak men, and women, and children, who could not compass any stratagem, and were not guided to a way
these it may be God will pardon, for God both pardons and forgives

But when ye have fulfilled your prayer, remember God standing and sitting and lying on your sides; and when ye are in safety then be steadfast in prayer; verily, prayer is for the believers prescribed and timed

And whoso commits a fault or a sin and throws it on the innocent, he hath to bear a calumny and a manifest sin

and I will lead them astray; and I will stir up vain desires within them; and I will order them and they shall surely crop the ears of cattle; and I will order them and they shall surely alter God's creation;' but he who takes the devil for his patron instead of God, he loses with a manifest loss
He promises them, and stirs up vain desires within them; but the devil promises only to deceive

Those who lie in wait for you, and if the victory be yours from God, say, 'Were we not with you?' and if the misbelievers have a chance, they say, 'Did we not get the mastery over you, and defend you from the believers?'

and for their misbelief, and for their saying about Mary a mighty calumny
and for their saying, 'Verily, we have killed the Messiah, Jesus the son of Mary, the apostle of God'.... but they did not kill him, and they did not crucify him, but a similitude was made for them.

But he who is forced by hunger, not inclined willfully to sin, verily, God is forgiving, compassionate
They will ask thee what is lawful for them? say, 'Lawful for you are good things and what ye have taught beasts of prey (to catch), training them like dogs; - ye teach them as God taught you; - so eat of what they catch for you, and mention the name of God over it, and fear God, for verily, God is swift in reckoning up

O ye who believe! when ye rise up to prayer wash your faces, and your hands as far as the elbows, and wipe - your heads, and your feet down to the ankles. And if ye are polluted, then purify yourselves. But if ye are sick, or on a journey, or if one of you comes from the privy, or if ye have touched women and cannot find water, then take fine surface sand and wipe your faces and your hands therewith. God does not wish to make any hindrance for you; but he wishes to purify you and to fulfill his favour upon you; haply ye may give thanks

They misbelieve who say, 'Verily, God is the Messiah the son of Mary;' say, 'Who has any hold on God, if he wished to destroy the Messiah the son of Mary, and his mother, and those who are on earth altogether?'

But the Jews and the Christians say, 'We are the sons of God and His beloved.' Say, 'Why then does He punish you for your sins? nay, ye are mortals of those whom He has created! He pardons whom He pleases, and punishes whom He pleases; for God's is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and what is between the two, and unto Him the journey is
O people of the Book! our Apostle has come to you, explaining to you the interval of apostles; lest ye say, 'There came not to us a herald of glad tidings nor a warner.' But there has come to you now a herald of glad tidings and a warner, and God is mighty over all
When Moses said to his people, 'O my people! remember the favour of God towards you when He made amongst you prophets, and made for you kings, and brought you what never was brought to anybody in the worlds

They said, ' O Moses! verily, therein is a people, giants; and we will surely not enter therein until they go out from thence; but if they go out then we will enter in
Then said two men of those who fear, - God had been gracious to them both, - 'Enter ye upon them by the door, and when ye have entered it, verily, ye shall be victorious; and upon God do ye rely if ye be believers
They said, 'O Moses! we shall never enter it so long as they are therein; so, go thou and thy Lord and fight ye twain; verily, we will sit down here
Said he, 'My Lord, verily, I can control only myself and my brother; therefore part us from these sinful people
He said, 'Then, verily, it is forbidden them; for forty years shall they wander about in the earth; so vex not thyself for the sinful people
Recite to them the story of the two sons of Adam; truly when they offered an offering and it was accepted from one of them, and was not accepted from the other, that one said, 'I will surely kill thee;' he said, 'God only accepts from those who fear
If thou dost stretch forth to me thine hand to kill me, I will not stretch forth mine hand to kill thee; verily, I fear God the Lord of the worlds
verily, I wish that thou mayest draw upon thee my sin and thy sin, and be of the fellows of the Fire, for that is the reward of the unjust
But his soul allowed him to slay his brother, and he slew him, and in the morning he was of those who lose
And God sent a crow to scratch in the earth and show him how he might hide his brother's shame, he said, ' Alas, for me! Am I too helpless to become like this crow and hide my brother's shame?' and in the morning he was of those who did repent
For this cause have we prescribed to the children of Israel that whoso kills a soul, unless it be for another soul or for violence in the land, it is as though he had killed men altogether; but whoso saves one, it is as though he saved men altogether. Our apostles came to them with manifest signs; then, verily, many of them did after that commit excesses in the earth
The reward of those who make war against God and His Apostle, and strive after violence in the earth, is only that they shall be slaughtered or crucified, or their hands cut off and their feet on alternate sides, or that they shall be banished from the land; - that is a disgrace for them in this world, and for them in the next is mighty woe
save for those who repent before ye have them in your power, for know ye that God is forgiving, merciful
O ye who believe! fear God and crave the means to approach Him, and be strenuous in His way, haply ye will prosper then
Verily, those who disbelieve, even though they had what is in the earth, all of it, and the like thereof with it, to offer as a ransom from the punishment of the resurrection day, it would not be accepted from them; but for them is grievous woe
They may wish to go forth from the Fire, but they shall not go forth therefrom, for them is lasting woe
The man thief and the woman thief, cut off the hands of both as a punishment, for that they have erred; - an example from God, for God is mighty, wise
But whoso turns again after his injustice and acts aright, verily, God will turn to him, for, verily, God is forgiving, merciful
Do ye not know that God, His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He punishes whom He pleases, and forgives whom He pleases, for God is mighty overall
O thou Apostle! let not those grieve thee who vie in misbelief; or those who say with their mouths 'We believe,' but their hearts do not believe; or of those who are Jews, listeners to a lie, - listeners to other people, but who come not to thee. They pervert the words from their places and say, ' If this is what ye are given, take it; but if ye are not given it, then beware!' but he whom God wishes to mislead, thou canst do nothing with God for him; these are those whose hearts God wishes not to purify, for them in this world is disgrace, and for them in the next is mighty woe
listeners to a lie, eaters of unlawful things! But if they come to thee, then judge between them or turn aside from them; but if thou turnest aside from them they shall not harm thee at all, but if thou judgest, then judge between them with justice, verily, God loves the just
But how should they make thee their judge, when they have the law wherein is God's judgment? Yet they turn back after that, for they do not believe
Verily, we have revealed the law in which is guidance and light; the prophets who we're resigned did judge thereby those who were Jews, as did the masters and doctors by what they remembered of the Book of God and by what they were witnesses of. Fear not men, but fear me, and sell not my signs for a little price; for whoso will not judge by what God has revealed, these be the misbelievers
We have prescribed for thee therein 'a life for a life, and an eye for an eye, and a nose for a nose, and an ear for an ear, and a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds retaliation;' but whoso remits it, it is an expiation for him, but he whoso will not judge by what God has revealed, these be the unjust
And we followed up the footsteps of these (prophets) with Jesus the son of Mary, confirming that which was before him and the law, and we brought him the gospel, wherein is guidance and light, verifying what was before it of the law, and a guidance and an admonition unto those who fear
Then let the people of the gospel judge by that which is revealed therein, for whoso will not judge by what God has revealed, these be the evildoers
We have revealed to thee the Book in truth verifying what was before it, and preserving it; judge then between them by what God has revealed, and follow not their lusts, turning away from what is given to thee of the truth. For each one of you have we made a law and a pathway; and had God pleased He would have made you one nation, but He will surely try you concerning that which He has brought you. Be ye therefore emulous in good deeds; to God is your return altogether, and He will let you know concerning that wherein ye do dispute
Wherefore judge thou between them by what God has revealed, and follow not their lusts; but beware lest they mislead thee from part of what God has revealed to thee; yet if they turn back, then know that God wishes to fall on them for some sins of theirs, - verily, many men are evildoers
Is it the judgment of the Ignorance they crave? but who is better than God to judge for people who are sure
O ye who believe! take not the Jews and Christians for your patrons : they are patrons of each other; but whoso amongst you takes them for patrons, verily, he is of them, and, verily, God guides not an unjust people
Thou wilt see those in whose hearts is a sickness vieing with them; they say, 'We fear lest there befall us a reverse.' It may be God will give the victory, or an order from Himself, and they may awake repenting of what they thought in secret to themselves
Those who believe say, 'Are these they who swore by God with their most strenuous oath that they were surely with you?' - their works are in vain and they shall wake the losers
O ye who believe! whoso is turned away from his religion - God will bring (instead) a people whom He loves and who love Him, lowly to believers, lofty to unbelievers, strenuous in the way of God, fearing not the blame of him who blames. That is God's grace! He gives it unto whom He pleases, for God both comprehends and knows
God only is your patron, and His Apostle and those who believe, who are steadfast in prayer and give alms, bowing down
Whoso taketh as patrons God and His apostles and those who believe; - verily, God's crew, they are victorious
O ye who believe! take not for patrons those who take your religion for a jest or a sport, from amongst those who have been given the Book before and the misbelievers; but fear God if ye be believers
Nor those who, when ye call to prayer, take it for a jest and a sport; that is because they are a people who do not understand
Say, 'O people of the Book! do ye disavow us, for aught but that we believe in God, and what was revealed to us before, and for that most of you are evildoers
Say, 'Can I declare unto you something worse than retribution from God?' Whomsoever God has cursed and been wroth with - and he has made of them apes and swine - and who worship Taghut, they are in a worse plight and are more erring from the level path
When they come to you they say, 'We believe;' but they entered in with unbelief, and they went out therewith, and God knows best what they did hide
Thou wilt see many of them vieing in sin and enmity, and in eating unlawful things, - evil is it that they have done
The masters and their doctors prohibit them from speaking sin and eating unlawful things, - evil is what they have performed
The Jews say, - 'God's hand is fettered;' their hands are fettered and they are cursed for what they said; nay! His hands are outspread, He expends how He pleases! and that which has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will surely increase many of them in their rebellion and misbelief, for we have cast amongst them enmity and hatred till the resurrection day. Whenever they light a fire for war, God puts it out; they strive for corruption in the earth, but God loves not the corrupt
But did the people of the Book believe and fear, we would cover their offences, and we would make them enter into gardens of pleasure
and were they steadfast in the law and the gospel, and what has been sent down to them from their Lord, they should eat from above them and below them. Amongst them are a nation who are moderate, but many of them - bad is what they do
O thou Apostle! preach what has been revealed to thee from thy Lord; if thou do it not thou hast not preached His message, and God will not hold thee free from men; for God guides not people who misbelieve
Say, 'O people of the Book! ye rest on naught until ye stand fast by the law and the gospel, and what is revealed to you from your Lord.' But what has been revealed to thee from thy Lord will of a surety increase many of them in rebellion and misbelief, vex not thyself then for a people who misbelieve
Verily, those who believe and those who are Jews, and the Sabaeans, and the Christians, whosoever believes in God and the last day, and does what is right, there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve
We took a compact of the children of Israel, and we sent to them apostles; every time there came to them an apostle with what their souls loved not, a part of them they did call liars and a part of them they slew
And they reckoned that there would be no disturbance; but they were blind and deaf! and then God turned again towards them: and then many amongst them were blind and deaf! but God saw what they did
They misbelieve who say, 'Verily, God is the Messiah the son of Mary;' but the Messiah said, 'O children of Israel! worship God, my Lord and your Lord;' verily, he who associates aught with God, God hath forbidden him Paradise, and his resort is the Fire, and the unjust shall have none to help them
They misbelieve who say, 'Verily, God is the third of three;' for there is no God but one, and if they do not desist from what they say, there shall touch those who misbelieve amongst them grievous woe
Will they not turn again towards God and ask pardon of Him? for God is forgiving and merciful
The Messiah the son of Mary is only a prophet: prophets before him have passed away; and his mother was a confessor; they used both to eat food. - See how we explain to them the signs, yet see how they turn aside
Say, 'Will ye serve, other than God, what can neither hurt you nor profit you?' but God, He both hears and knows
Say, 'O people of the Book! exceed not the truth in your religion, and follow not the lusts of a people who have erred before, and who lead many astray, and who go away from the level path
Those of the children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of David and Jesus the son of Mary; that is because they rebelled and did transgress
they would not desist from the wrong they did; evil is that which they did
Thou wilt see many of them taking those who disbelieve for their patrons; evil is that which their souls have sent before them, for God's wrath is on them, and in the torment shall they dwell for aye
But had they believed in God and the prophet, and what was revealed to him, they had not taken these for their patrons; but many of them are evildoers
Thou wilt surely find that the strongest in enmity against those who believe are the Jews and the idolaters; and thou wilt find the nearest in love to those who believe to be those who say, 'We are Christians;' that is because there are amongst them priests and monks, and because they are not proud
And when they hear what has been revealed to the prophet, you will see their eyes gush with tears at what they recognise as truth therein; and they will say, 'O our Lord! we believe, so write us down amongst the witnesses
Why should we not believe in God and the truth that is given to us, nor desire that our Lord should make us enter with the upright people
Therefore has God rewarded them, for what they said, with gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; that is the reward of those who do good
but those who disbelieve and say our signs are lies, they are the fellows of hell

But eat of what God has provided you lawfully of good things; and fear God, in whom ye believe
God will not catch you up for a casual word in your oaths, but He will catch you up for having what ye make deliberate oaths about; and the expiation thereof is to feed ten poor men with the middling food ye feed your families withal, or to clothe them, or to free a neck; but he who has not the means, then let him fast three days. That is the expiation of your oaths, when ye have sworn to keep your oaths; thus does God explain to you His signs, - haply ye may be grateful
O ye who believe! verily, wine, and el maisar, and statues, and divining (arrows) are only an abomination of Satan's work; avoid them then that haply ye may prosper
Satan only desires to place enmity and hatred between you by wine and maisar, and to turn you from the remembrance of God and from prayer; but will ye not desist
and obey God, and obey the apostles, and beware, for if ye turn back then know that our Apostle has only his message to preach
There is no crime in those who believe and do right, for having tasted food, when they fear God, and believe, and do what is right, and then fear Him, and believe, and then fear, and do good, for God loves those who do good
O ye who believe! God will try you with something of the game that your hands and your lances take, that God may know who fears Him in secret; and whoso transgresses after that, for him is grievous woe
O ye who believe! kill not game while ye are on pilgrimage. But he amongst you who kills it purposely, his compensation is the like of that which he has killed, in sheep -- of which two equitable persons amongst you shall be judge -- an offering brought to the Kaabah; or as an expiation, the food of poor persons, or an equivalent thereof in fasting, that he may taste the evil result of his deed. God pardons bygones; but whoso returns, God will take vengeance on him, for God is mighty and the avenger
Lawful for you is the game of the sea, and to eat thereof; a provision for you and for travellers; but forbidden you is the game of the land while ye are on pilgrimage; so fear God to whom ye shall be gathered
God has made the Kaabah, the sacred House, to be a station for men, and the sacred month, and the offering and its neck garland; this is that ye may know that God knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and that God knows all things
Know that God is keen to punish, but that God is forgiving, merciful
The Apostle has only to preach his message, but God knows what ye show and what ye hide
Say, 'The vile shall not be deemed equal with the good, although the abundance of the vile please thee.' Fear God then, O ye who have minds! haply ye may prosper
O ye who believe! ask not about things which if they be shown to you will pain you; but if ye ask about them when the (whole) Qur'an is revealed, they shall be shown to you. God pardons that, for God is forgiving and clement

O ye who believe! let there be a testimony between you when any one of you is on the point of death - at the time he makes his will - two equitable persons from amongst you; or two others from some other folk, if ye be knocking about in the land, and the calamity of death befall you; ye shall shut them both up after prayer, and they shall both swear by God, if ye doubt them, (saying), 'We will not sell (our testimony) for a price, though it were to a relative, nor will we hide God's testimony, verily, then, we should be among sinners
But if it shall be lit upon that they too have deserved the imputation of sin, then let two others stand up in their place with those who think them deserving of the imputation, the nearest two in kin, and they shall both swear by God, 'Indeed, our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not transgressed, for then we should surely be of the unjust
thus is it easier for men to bear testimony according to the purport thereof, else must they fear lest an oath be given to rebut their own oath; but let them fear God and listen, for God guides not the people who do ill
On the day when God shall assemble the apostles and shall say, 'How were ye answered?' they will say, 'We have no knowledge; verily, thou art He who knoweth the unseen
When God said, 'O Jesus, son of Mary! remember my favours towards thee and towards thy mother, when I aided thee with the Holy Ghost, till thou didst speak to men in the cradle and when grown up.

And when I inspired the apostles that they should believe in him and in my Apostle, they said, "We believe; do thou bear witness that we are resigned

and they said, 'We desire to eat therefrom that our hearts may be at rest, and that we may know that what thou hast told us is the truth, and that we may be thereby amongst the witnesses
Said Jesus the son of Mary, 'O God, our Lord! send down to us a table from heaven to be to us as a festival, - to the first of us and to the last, and a sign from Thee, - and grant us provision, for Thou art the best of providers
God said, 'Verily, I am about to send it down to you; but whoso disbelieves amongst you after that, verily, I will torment him with the torment which I have not tormented any one with in all the worlds
And when God said, 'O Jesus, son of Mary! is it thou who didst say to men, take me and my mother for two gods, beside God?' He said, 'I celebrate Thy praise! what ails me that I should say what I have no right to? If I had said it, Thou wouldst have known it; Thou knowest what is in my soul, but I know not what is in Thy soul; verily, Thou art one who knoweth the unseen
I never told them save what Thou didst bid me, - "Worship God, my Lord and your Lord," and I was a witness against them so long as I was amongst them; but when Thou didst take me away to thyself Thou wert the watcher over them, for Thou art witness over all

God's is the kingdom of the heavens, and the earth, and all that is therein, and He is mighty over all
Praise belongs to God who created the heavens and the earth, and brought into being the darkness and the light. Yet do those who misbelieve hold Him to have peers

Then we destroyed them in their sins, and raised up other generations after them
Had we sent down to thee a book on paper, and they had touched it with their hands, still those who misbelieve would have said, 'This is naught but obvious magic
They say, 'Why has not an angel been sent down to him?' but if we had sent down an angel, the affair would have been decided, and then they would have had no respite
And had we made him an angel, we should have made him as a man too; and we would have made perplexing for them that which they deem perplexing now
There have been prophets before thee mocked at, but that encompassed them which the scoffers among them mocked at
Say, 'Go about in the earth, then wilt thou see how has been the end of those who called them liars

Say, 'I fear, if I rebel against my Lord, the torment of the mighty day
Whomsoever it is averted from on that day, God will have had mercy on; and that is obvious happiness
And if God touch thee with harm, there is none to take it off but He; and if He touch thee with good, He is mighty over all
He is sovereign over His servants, He is the wise, the aware
Say, 'What is the greatest witness?' Say, 'God is witness between you and me.' This Qur'an was inspired to me to warn you and those it reaches. Do ye really bear witness that with God are other gods?

Those to whom we have brought the Book know him as they know their sons;- those who lose their souls do not believe

On the day when we shall gather them all together, then shall we say to those who have associated others with ourself, 'Where are your associates whom ye did pretend
Then they will have no excuse but to say, 'By God our Lord, we did not associate (others with thee)
See how they lie against themselves, and how what they did forge deserts them
And they are some who listen unto thee, but we have placed a veil upon their hearts lest they should understand it, and in their ears is dullness of hearing; and though they saw each sign they would not believe therein; until when they come to thee to wrangle with thee, the unbelievers say, 'These are but old folks' tales
They forbid it and they avoid it;- but they destroy none but themselves; yet they do not perceive
But couldst thou see when they are set over the fire and say, 'Would that we were sent back! we would not call our Lord's signs lies, but we would be of the believers

The life of this world is nothing but a game and a sport, and surely the next abode were better for those who fear. What! do they not understand
Full well we know that verily that which they say grieves thee; but they do not call thee only a liar for the unjust gainsay the signs of God

Say, 'Look you now! if there should come God's torment, or there should come to you the hour, on other than God would ye call, if ye do tell the truth

Say, 'Look you now! if God's torment should come upon you suddenly or openly, would any perish save the people who do wrong
We do not send our messengers save as heralds of glad tidings and of warning, and whoso believes and acts aright, there is no fear for them, and they shall not be grieved
but those who say our signs are lies, torment shall touch them, for that they have done so wrong
Say, 'I do not say to you, mine are the treasuries of God, nor that I know the unseen; I do not say to you, I am an angel - if I follow aught but what I am inspired with -:' say, 'Is the blind equal to him who sees?' what! do ye not reflect
Admonish therewith those who fear that they shall be gathered unto their Lord; there is no patron for them but Him, and no intercessor; haply they may fear
Repulse not those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening, desiring His face; they have no reckoning against thee at all, and thou hast no reckoning against them at all;- repulse them and thou wilt be of the unjust
So have we tried some of them by others, that they may say, 'Are these those unto whom God has been gracious amongst ourselves?' Does not God know those who give thanks

Thus do we detail our signs, that the way of the sinners may be made plain
Say, 'I am forbidden to worship those ye call upon beside God;' say, 'I will not follow your lusts, for then should I err and not be of the guided
Say, 'I stand on a manifestation from my Lord, which ye call a lie. I have not with me what ye fain would hasten on, ???MISSING
Missing??? that the matter might be settled between me and you; but God knows best who are the unjust
With Him are the keys of the unseen. None knows them save He; He knows what is in the land and in the sea; and there falls not a leaf save that He knows it; nor a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor aught that is moist, nor aught that is dry, save that is in His perspicuous Book
He it is who takes you to Himself at night, and knows what ye have gained in the day; then He raises you up again, that your appointed time may be fulfilled; then unto Him is your return, and then will He inform you of what ye have done
He triumphs over His servants; He sends to them guardian angels, until, when death comes to any one of you, our messengers take him away; they pass not over any one
and then are they returned to God, their true sovereign. Is not His the rule? but He is very quick at reckoning up
Say, 'Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and of the sea?' ye call upon Him in humility and in secret, 'Indeed, if He would rescue us from this, we will surely be of those who give Him thanks
Say, 'God rescues from the darkness thereof, and from every trouble, yet ye associate others with Him

to every prophecy is a set time, and in the end ye shall know
When thou dost see those who plunge deeply into the discussion of our signs, turn from them until they plunge deeply into some other discourse; for it may be that Satan may make thee forget; but sit not, after thou hast remembered, with the unjust people
Those who fear are not bound to take account of them at all, but mind!- haply they may fear
Leave those who have taken their religion for a play and a sport, whom this world's life hath deceived, and remind them thereby that a soul shall be given up for what it has earned; nor has it, beside God, patron or intercessor; and though it should compensate with the fullest compensation, it would not be accepted. Those who are given up for what they have gained, for them is a drink of boiling water, and grievous woe for that they have misbelieved
Say, 'Shall we call on what neither profits us nor harms us, and be thrown back upon our heels after God has guided us, like him whom Satan hath led away bewildered in the earth, who has companions who call him to guidance, "Come to us?" ' Say, 'Verily, God's guidance is the guidance, and we are bidden to resign ourselves unto the Lord of the worlds
and be ye steadfast in prayer and fear Him, for He it is to whom we shall be gathered
He it is who has created the heavens and the earth in truth; and on the day when He says, 'BE,' then it is. His word is truth; to Him is the kingdom on the day when the trumpets shall be blown; the knower of the unseen and of the evident; He is wise and well aware
When Abraham said to his father Azar, 'Dost thou take idols for gods? verily, I see thee and thy people in obvious error

And when he saw the moon beginning to rise he said, 'This is my Lord;' but when it set he said, 'If God my Lord guides me not I shall surely be of the people who err
And when he saw the sun beginning to rise he said, 'This is my Lord, this is greatest of all;' but when it set he said, 'O my people! verily, I am clear of what ye associate with God
verily, I have turned my face to him who originated the heaven and the earth, as a 'Hanif, and I am not of the idolaters
And his people disputed with him;- he said, 'Do ye dispute with me concerning God, when He has guided me? but I fear not what ye associate with Him unless my Lord should wish for anything. My Lord doth comprehend all things in His knowledge, will ye not then remember
How should I fear what ye associate with Him, when ye yourselves fear not to associate with God what He has sent down to you no power to do? Which then of the two sects is worthier of belief, if indeed ye know
Those who believe and do not obscure their faith with wrong, they are those who shall have security, and they are guided
These are our arguments which we gave to Abraham against his people;- we raise the rank of whom we will; verily, thy Lord is wise and knowing
And we gave to him Isaac and Jacob, each did we guide. And Noah we guided before and all his seed,- David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron,- for thus do we reward those who do good
And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias, all righteous ones
and Ishmael and Elisha and Jonas and Lot, each one have we preferred above the worlds
and of their fathers and their seed and brethren; we have chosen them and guided them into a right way
That is God's guidance; He guides those whom He will of His servants; and if they associate aught with Him,- vain is that which they have worked
It is to these we give the Book and judgment and prophecy; and if these disbelieve therein we have given them in charge to a people who shall not disbelieve
It is these that God hath guided, and by their guidance be thou led. Say, 'I will not ask you for it a hire: it is naught save a reminder to the worlds
They do not prize God at His true worth when they say, 'God has never revealed to mortal anything.' Say, 'Who revealed the Book wherewith Moses came, a light and a guidance unto men? Ye put it on papers which ye show, though ye hide much; and ye are taught what ye knew not, neither you nor your fathers.' Say, 'God,' then leave them in their discussion to play
This is the Book which we have revealed, a blessing and a confirmation to those which were before it, and that the mother of cities may be warned, with those who are round about her. Those who believe in the last day believe therein, and they unto their prayers will keep
Who is more unjust than he who devises against God a lie, or says, 'I am inspired,' when he was not inspired at all? and who says, 'I will bring down the like of what God has sent down;' but didst thou see when the unjust are in the floods of death, and the angels stretch forth their hands, 'Give ye forth your souls; today shall ye be recompensed with the torment of disgrace, for that ye did say against God what was not true, and were too proud to hear His signs
And ye come now single-handed as we created you at first, and ye have left behind your backs that which we granted you; and we see not with you your intercessors whom ye pretended were partners amongst you; betwixt you have the ties been cut asunder; and strayed away from you is what ye did pretend
Verily, God it is who cleaves out the grain and the date-stone; He brings forth the living from the dead, and it is He who brings the dead from the living. There is God! how then can ye be beguiled
He it is who cleaves out the morning, and makes night a repose, and the sun and the moon two reckonings - that is the decree of the mighty, the wise
He it is who made for you stars that ye might be guided thereby in the darkness of the land and of the sea. Now have we detailed the signs unto a people who do know
He it is who made you spring from one soul, and gave you a settlement and a depository. Now have we detailed the signs unto a people who discern
He it is who sends down from the heavens water; and we bring forth therewith growths of everything; and we bring forth therefrom green things, where - from we bring forth grain in full ear; and the palm, from its spathe come clusters within reach; and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, alike and unlike;- behold its fruit when it fruits and ripens! verily, in that ye have a sign for the people who believe
Yet they made the ginn partners with God, though He created them! and they ascribed to Him sons and daughters, though they have no knowledge; celebrated be His praise! and exalted be He above what they attribute to Him
The inventor of the heavens and the earth! how can He have a son, when He has no female companion, and when He has created everything, and everything He knows
There is God for you,- your Lord! There is no god but He, the Creator of everything; then worship Him, for He o'er everything keeps guard
Sight perceives Him not, but He perceives men's sights; for He is the subtle, the aware
Now has an insight from your Lord come unto you, and he who looks therewith it is for himself; but he who is blind thereto, it is against his soul; and I am not your keeper
Thus do we turn about the signs, that they may say, 'Thou hast studied,' and that we may explain to those who know
Follow what is revealed to thee from thy Lord; there is no god but He, and shun the idolaters
But had God pleased, they would not have associated aught with Him; but we have not made thee a keeper over them, nor art thou for them a warder
Do not abuse those who call on other than God, for then they may abuse God openly in their ignorance. So do we make seemly to every nation their work, then unto their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of what they have done
They swore by God with their most strenuous oath, that if there come to them a sign they will indeed believe therein. Say, 'Signs are only in God's hands;- but what will make you understand that even when one has come, they will not believe
We will overturn their hearts and their eye-sights, even as they believed not at first; and we will leave them, in their rebellion, blindly wandering on
And had we sent down unto them the angels, or the dead had spoken to them, or we had gathered everything unto them in hosts, they would not have believed unless that God pleased - but most of them are ignorant
So have we made for every prophet an enemy,- devils of men and ginns; some of them inspire others with specious speech to lead astray; but had thy Lord pleased they would not have done it; so leave them with what they do devise
And let the hearts of those who believe not in the hereafter listen to it; and let them be well pleased with it; and let them gain what they may gain
Of other than God shall I crave a decree, when it is He who has sent down to you the Book in detail, and those to whom we gave the Book know that it is sent down from thy Lord, in truth? be thou not then of those who doubt
The words of thy Lord are fulfilled in truth and justice; there is none to change His words, for He both hears and knows
But if thou followest most of those who are in the land, they will lead thee astray from the path of God; they only follow suspicion and they only (rest on) conjecture
Thy Lord, He knows best who errs from His path, and He knows best the guided
Eat then of what God's name has been pronounced over, if ye believe in His signs
What ails you that ye do not eat from what God's name is pronounced over, when He has detailed to you what is unlawful for you? Save what ye are forced to; but, verily, many will lead you astray by their fancies, without knowledge. Verily, thy Lord knows best the transgressors
Leave alone the outside of sin and the inside thereof; verily, those who earn sin shall be recompensed for what they have gained
But eat not of what the name of God has not been pronounced over, for, verily, it is an abomination. Verily, the devils inspire their friends that they may wrangle with you; but if ye obey them, verily, ye are idolaters
Is he who was dead and we have quickened him, and made for him a light, that he might walk therein amongst men, like him whose likeness is in the darkness whence he cannot come forth? Thus is made seemly to the misbelievers what they have done
And thus have we placed in every town the great sinners thereof, that they may use craft therein; but they use not craft except against themselves, although they do not understand
And when there comes to them a sign, they say, 'We will not believe until we are brought like what the apostles were brought;' God knows best where to put His message. There shall befall those who sin, meanness in God's eyes, and grievous torment for the craft they used
Whomsoever God wishes to guide, He expands his breast to Islam; but whomsoever He wishes to lead astray, He makes his breast tight and straight, as though he would mount up into heaven; thus does God set His horror on those who do not believe
This is the way of thy Lord - straight. We have detailed the signs unto a mindful people
for them is an abode of peace; and their Lord, He is their patron for what they have done
And on the day when He shall gather them all together, 'O assembly of the ginns! ye have got much out of mankind.' And their clients from among mankind shall say, 'O our Lord! much advantage had we one from another;' but we reached our appointed time which thou hadst appointed for us. Says He, 'The fire is your resort, to dwell therein for aye! save what God pleases; verily, thy Lord is wise and knowing
Thus do we make some of the unjust patrons of the others, for that which they have earned
O assembly of ginns and men! did there not come to you apostles from among yourselves, relating to you our signs, and warning you of the meeting of this very day of yours? They say, 'We bear witness against ourselves.' The life of this world deceived them, and they bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers
That is because thy Lord would never destroy towns unjustly while their people are careless
but for every one are degrees of what they have done and thy Lord is not careless of that which they do
Thy Lord is rich, merciful; if He pleases He will take you off, and will cause what He pleases to succeed you; even as He raised you up from the seed of other people
Verily, what ye are promised will surely come, nor can ye frustrate it
Say, 'O my people! act according to your power, verily, I am acting too; and soon shall ye know whose is the future of the abode!' verily, the unjust shall not prosper
They set apart for God, from what He raises of tilth and of cattle, a portion, and they say, 'This is God's;' - as they pretend - ' and this is for our associates;' but that which is for their associates reaches not to God, and that which was for God does reach to their associates;- evil is it what they judge
Thus too have their associates made seemly to many of the idolaters the killing of their children, to destroy them, and to obscure for them their religion; but had God pleased they would not have done it, leave them alone and that which they have forged
And they say, 'These cattle and tilth are inviolable; none shall taste thereof, save such as we please' - as they pretend - and there are cattle whose backs are prohibited, and cattle over whom God's name is not pronounced,- forging a lie against Him! He shall reward them for what they have forged
And they say, 'What is in the wombs of these cattle is unlawful for our wives, but if it be (born) dead, then are they partners therein.' He will reward them for their attribution; verily, He is wise and knowing
Losers are they who kill their children foolishly, without knowledge, and who prohibit what God has bestowed upon them, forging a lie against God; they have erred and are not guided
He it is who brought forth gardens with trailed and untrailed vines, and the palms and corn land, with various food, and olives, and pomegranates, alike and unlike. Eat from the fruit thereof whene'er it fruits, and bring the dues thereof on the day of harvest, and be not extravagant; verily, He loves not the extravagant
Of cattle are there some to ride on and to spread. Eat of what God has bestowed upon you, and follow not the footsteps of Satan; verily, he is to you an open foe
Eight pairs,- of sheep two, and of goats two; say, 'Are the two males unlawful, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? inform me with knowledge if ye tell the truth
And of camels two, and cows two; say, 'Are the two males unlawful, or the two females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were ye witnesses when God ordained for you these?- Then who is more unjust than he who devises a lie against God, to lead men astray without knowledge? verily, God guides not the unjust people
Say, 'I cannot find in what I am inspired with anything unlawful for the taster to taste; unless it be dead (of itself), or blood that has been shed, or the flesh of swine,- for that is a horror - or an abomination that is consecrated to other than God. But he who is forced, not willfully nor transgressing,- then, verily, thy Lord is forgiving and merciful
To those who were Jews did we prohibit everything that hath a solid hoof; and of oxen and sheep did we prohibit to them the fat, save what the backs of both do bear, or the inwards, or what is mixed with bone; with that did we recompense them for their rebellion, for, verily, we are true
And if they give thee the lie, say, 'Your Lord is of ample mercy, nor shall His violence be turned back from the sinful people
Those who associate others with God will say, 'Had God pleased, we had not so associated, nor our fathers; nor should we have forbidden aught.' Thus did they give the lie to those who came before them, until they tasted of our violence! Say, 'Have ye any knowledge? if so, bring it forth to us: ye only follow suspicion, and ye do but conjecture
Say, 'God's is the searching argument; and had He pleased He would have guided you all
Say, 'Come on then with your witnesses, who bear witness that God has prohibited these!' but if they do bear witness, bear thou not witness with them; nor follow the lust of those who say our signs are lies, and those who do not believe in the last day, or those who for their Lord make peers
Say, 'Come! I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you, that ye may not associate aught with Him, and (may show) kindness to your parents, and not kill your children through poverty;- we will provide for you and them;- and draw not nigh to flagrant sins, either apparent or concealed, and kill not the soul, which God hath forbidden save by right; that is what God ordains you, haply ye may understand
And draw not nigh unto the wealth of the orphan, save so as to better it, until he reaches full age; and give weight and measure with justice. We do not compel the soul save what it can compass; and when ye pronounce, then be just, though it be in the case of a relative
And God's compact fulfill ye; that is what He ordained you, haply ye may be mindful. Verily, this is my right way; follow it then, and follow not various paths, to separate yourselves from His way; that is what He has ordained you, haply ye may fear
Then we gave Moses the Book, complete for him who acts aright, and a decision and a guidance and a mercy; haply in the meeting of their Lord they will believe
This is the Book which we have sent down; it is a blessing; follow it then and fear; haply ye may obtain mercy
Lest ye say, 'The Book was only sent down to two sects before us; verily, we, for what they read, care naught
Or, lest ye should say, 'Had we had a book revealed to us we should surely have been more guided than they;' but there is come to them a manifest sign from their Lord, and a guidance and a mercy; who then is more unjust than he who calls God's signs lies, and turns from them? we will reward those who turn from our signs with an evil punishment for that they turned away
What do they expect but that the angels should come for them, or that thy Lord should come, or that some signs of thy Lord should come? On the day when some signs do come, its faith shall profit no soul which did not believe before, unless it has earned some good by its faith. Say, 'Wait ye expectant, then we wait expectant too
Verily, those who divided their religion and became sects, thou hast not to do with them, their matter is in God's hands, He will yet inform them of that which they have done
He who brings a good work shall have ten like it; but he who brings a bad work shall be recompensed only with the like thereof, for they shall not be wronged
Say, 'As for me, my Lord has guided me to the right way, a right religion,- the faith of Abraham the 'Hanif, for he was not of the idolaters
Say, 'Verily, my prayers and my devotion and my life and my death belong to God, the Lord of the worlds
He has no partner; that is what I am bidden; for I am first of those who are resigned
Say, 'Other than God shall I crave for a Lord when He is Lord of all?' but no soul shall earn aught save against itself; nor shall one bearing a burden bear the burden of another; and then unto your Lord is your return, and He will inform you concerning that whereon ye do dispute
He it is who made you vicegerents, and raised some of you above others in degree, to try you by that which he has brought you;- verily, thy Lord is swift to punish, but, verily, He is forgiving and merciful
S
A book revealed to thee,- so let there be no straitness in thy breast, that thou mayest warn thereby,- and a reminder to the believers
Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord, and follow not beside Him patrons; little is it that ye mind
Yet how many a town have we destroyed, and our violence came upon it by night, or while they slept at noon; and their cry, when our violence came upon them
was only to say, 'Verily, we were unjust
But we will of a surety question those to whom the prophets were sent
and we will narrate to them with knowledge, for we were not absent
The balance on that day is true, and whosesoever scales are heavy, they are prosperous
but whosesoever scales are light, they it is who lose themselves, for that they did act unjustly by our signs
We have established you in the earth, and we have made for you therein livelihoods; little is it that ye thank
and we created you, then we fashioned you, then we said unto the angels, ' Adore Adam,' and they adored, save Iblis, who was not of those who did adore
Said He, 'What hinders thee from adoring when I order thee?' he said, 'I am better than he; Thou hast created me from fire, and him Thou hast created out of clay
Said He, 'Then go down therefrom; what ails thee that thou shouldst be big with pride therein? go forth! verily, thou art of the little ones
He said, 'Respite me until the day when they shall be raised
He said, 'Verily, thou art of the respited
said he, 'For that Thou hast led me into error, I will lie in wait for them in Thy straight path
then I will surely come to them, from before them and from behind them; and most of them Thou shalt not find thankful
He said, 'Go forth there-from, despised, expelled; whoso follows thee, I will surely fill hell with you altogether
But, O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in Paradise and eat from whence ye will, but draw not nigh unto this tree or ye will be of the unjust
But Satan whispered to them to display to them what was kept back from them of their shame, and he said, 'Your Lord has only forbidden you this tree lest ye should be twain angels, or should become of the immortals
and he swore to them both, 'Verily, I am unto you a sincere adviser
and he beguiled them by deceit, and when they twain tasted of the tree, their shame was shown them, and they began to stitch upon themselves the leaves of the garden. And their Lord called unto them, 'Did I not forbid you from that tree there, and say to you, Verily, Satan is to you an open foe
They said, 'O our Lord! we have wronged ourselves - and if Thou dost not forgive us and have mercy on us, we shall surely be of those who are lost
He said, 'Go ye down, one of you to the other a foe; but for you in the earth there is an abode, and a provision for a season
He said, 'Therein shall ye live and therein shall ye die, from it shall ye be brought forth
O sons of Adam! we have sent down to you garments wherewith to cover your shame, and plumage; but the garment of piety, that is better. That is one of the signs of God, haply ye may remember
O sons of Adam! let not Satan infatuate you as he drove your parents out of Paradise, stripping from them their garments, and showing them their shame; verily, he sees you - he and his tribe, from whence ye cannot see them. Verily, we have made the devils patrons of those who do not believe
and when they commit an abomination they say, 'We found our fathers at this, and God bade us do it.' Say, 'God bids you not to do abomination; do ye say against God that which ye do not know
Say, 'My Lord bids only justice: - set steadfastly your faces at every mosque and pray to Him, being sincere in your religion. As He brought you forth in the beginning, shall ye return
A sect He guides, and for a sect of them was error due; verily, they did take the devils for their patrons instead of God, and they did count that they were guided
O sons of Adam! take your ornaments to every mosque; and eat and drink, but do not be extravagant, for He loves not the extravagant
Say, 'Who has prohibited the ornaments of God which He brought forth for His servants, and the good things of His providing?' say, 'On the day of judgment they shall only be for those who believed when in the life of this world.' Thus do we detail the signs unto a people that do know
Say, 'My Lord has rely prohibited abominable deeds, the apparent thereof and the concealed thereof, and sin, and greed for that which is not right, and associating with God what He has sent down no power for, and saying against God that which ye do not know
Every nation has its appointed time, and when their appointed time comes they cannot keep it back an hour, nor can they bring it on
O sons of Adam! verily, there will come to you apostles from amongst you, narrating unto you my signs; then whoso fears God and does what is right, there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve
But those who say my signs are lies, and who are too big with pride for them, these are the fellows of the Fire, they shall dwell therein for aye
Who is more unjust than he who devises against God a lie, or says His signs are lies? These, their portion of the Book shall reach them, until when our messengers come to take their souls away, and say, 'Where is what ye used to call upon instead of God?' they say, 'They have strayed away from us;' and they shall bear witness against themselves that they have been misbelievers
He will say, 'Enter ye - amongst the nations who have passed away before you, both of ginns and men - into the fire;' whenever a nation enters therein, it curses its mate; until, when they have all reached it, the last of them will say unto the first, 'O our Lord! these it was who led us astray, give them double torment of the fire!' He will say, 'To each of you double! but ye do not know
And the first of them will say unto the last, 'Ye have no preference over us, so taste ye the torment for that which ye have earned
Verily, those who say our signs are lies and are too big with pride for them; for these the doors of heaven shall not be opened, and they shall not enter into Paradise until a camel shall pass into a needle's eye
It is thus that we reward the sinners; for them is a couch of hell-fire, with an awning above them! thus do we reward the unjust
But those who believe and do what is right - we will not oblige a soul more than its capacity - they are the fellows of Paradise, they shall dwell therein for aye
We will strip away what ill feeling is in their breasts - there shall flow beneath them rivers, and they shall say, 'Praise belongs to God who guided us to this! for we should not have been guided had not God guided us! - the apostles of our Lord did come to us with truth!' And it shall be cried out to them, 'This is Paradise which ye have as an inheritance for that which ye have done
And the fellows of Paradise will call out to the fellows of the Fire, 'We have now found that what our Lord promised us is true; have ye found that what your Lord promised you is true?' They will say, 'Yea!' And a crier from amongst them will cry out, 'The curse of God is on the unjust
who turn from the way of God and crave to make it crooked, while in the hereafter they do disbelieve
And betwixt the two there is a veil, and on al Aaraf are men who know each by marks; and they shall cry out to the fellows of Paradise, 'Peace be upon you!' they cannot enter it although they so desire
But when their sight is turned towards the fellows of the Fire, they say, 'O our Lord! place us not with the unjust people
And the fellows on al Aaraf will cry out to the men whom they know by their marks, and say, 'Of no avail to you were your collections, and what ye were so big with pride about
are these those ye swore that God would not extend mercy to? Enter ye Paradise; there is no fear for you, nor shall ye be grieved
But the fellows of the Fire shall cry out to the fellows of Paradise, 'Pour out upon us water, or something of what God has provided you with.' They will say, 'God has prohibited them both to those who misbelieve
who took their religion for a sport and a play; whom the life of the world beguiled.' - Today do we forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day, and for that they did deny our signs
Now we have brought them a book explaining it in knowledge, a guidance and a mercy to a people who believe
Do they wait now for aught but its interpretation?- on the day when its interpretation shall come, those who forgot it before will say, There did come to us the apostles of our Lord in truth, have we intercessors to intercede for us? or, could we return, we would do otherwise than we did.' They have lost themselves, and that which they devised has strayed away from them
Verily, your Lord is God who created the heavens and the earth in six days; then He made for the Throne. He covers night with the day - it pursues it incessantly - and the sun and the moon and the stars are subject to His bidding. Aye!- His is the creation and the bidding,- blessed be God the Lord of the worlds
Call on your Lord humbly and secretly, verily, He loves not the transgressors
And do not evil in the earth after it has been righted; and call upon Him with fear and earnestness; verily, the mercy of God is nigh unto those who do well
He it is who sends forth the winds as heralds before His mercy; until when they lift the heavy cloud which we drive to a dead land, and send down thereon water, and bring forth therewith every kind of fruit; - thus do we brine, forth the dead; haply ye may remember
And the good land brings forth its vegetation by the permission of its Lord; and that which is vile brings forth naught but scarcity. Thus do we turn about our signs for a people who are grateful
We did send Noah unto his people, and he said, 'O my people! serve God, ye have no god but Him; verily, I fear for you the torment of the mighty day
Said the chiefs of his people, 'Verily, we do surely see you in obvious error
Said he, 'O my people! there is no error in me; but I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds
I preach to you the messages of my Lord, and I give you sincere advice; and I know from God what ye know not
What! do ye wonder that there came to you a reminder from your Lord by a man from amongst yourselves, to warn you, and that ye may fear? but haply ye may receive mercy
But they called him a liar, and we rescued him and those who were with him in the ark; and we drowned those who said our signs were lies, verily, they were a blind people
And unto 'Ad (we sent) their brother Hud, who said, 'O my people! serve God, ye have no god save Him; what! will ye not then fear
Said the chiefs of those who misbelieved amongst his people, 'Verily, we see thee in folly, and, verily, we certainly think thou art of the liars
He said, 'O my people! there is no folly in me; but I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds
I preach to you the messages of your Lord; and, verily, I am to you a faithful adviser
What! do ye then wonder that there comes to you a reminder from your Lord by a man from amongst yourselves, to warn you? remember when He made you vicegerents after Noah's people and increased you in length of stature; remember, then, the benefits of God,- haply ye may prosper
They said, 'Hast thou come to us that we may worship God alone, and leave what our fathers used to worship? then bring us what thou dost threaten us with, if thou art of those who tell the truth
He said, 'There shall fall upon you from your Lord horror and wrath; do ye wrangle with me about names, which ye and your fathers have named yourselves, for which God sent down no power; wait then expectant, and I with you will wait expectant too
But we rescued him and those with him, by mercy from ourselves, and we cut off the hindermost parts of those who said our signs were lies and who were not believers
Unto Thamud (we sent) their brother Zalih, who said, 'O my people! worship God; ye have no god but Him: there has come to you a manifest sign from your Lord. This she-camel of God's is a sign for you; leave her then to eat in the land of God, and touch her not with evil, or there will overtake you grievous woe
And remember how he made you vicegerents after 'Ad and established you in the earth, so that ye took for yourselves castles on its plains and hewed out mountains into houses; and remember the benefits of God, and waste not the land, despoiling it
Said the chiefs of those who were big with pride from amongst his people to those who were weak,- to those amongst them who believed, 'Do ye know that Zalih is sent from his Lord?' They said, 'We do believe in that with which he is sent
Said those who were big with pride, 'Verily, in what ye do believe we disbelieve
Then they did hamstring the camel, and rebelled against the bidding of their Lord and said, 'O Zalih! bring us what thou didst threaten us with, if thou art of those who are sent
Then the earthquake took them, and in the morning they lay prone in their dwellings
and he turned away from them and said, 'O my people! I did preach to you the message of my Lord, and I gave you good advice! but ye love not sincere advisers
And Lot, when he said to his people, 'Do ye approach an abomination which no one in all the world ever anticipated you in
verily, ye approach men with lust rather than women - nay, ye are a people who exceed
But his people's answer only was to say, 'Turn them out of your village, verily, they are a people who pretend to purity
But we saved him and his people, except his wife, who was of those who lingered
and we rained down upon them a rain; - see then how was the end of the sinners
And unto Midian did we send their brother Shohaib, who said, 'O my people! serve God, ye have no god save Him. There has come to you a manifest sign from your Lord; then give good weight and measure, and be not niggardly of your gifts to men, and do not evil in the earth after it has been righted. That is better for you if ye are believers
and sit not down in every path, threatening and turning from the path of God those who believe in Him, and craving to make it crooked. Remember when ye were few and He multiplied you; and see what was the end of the evildoers
And if there be a party of you who believe in what I am sent with, and a party who believe not, then wait patiently until God judges between us, for He is the best of judges
Said the crowd of those who were big with pride amongst His people, 'We will of a surety turn thee out, O Shohaib! and those who believe with thee, from our village; or else thou shalt return unto our faith.' Said he, 'What even if we be averse therefrom
We shall have devised a lie against God if we return unto your faith, after God has saved us from it; and what should ail us that we should return thereto, unless that God our Lord should please? our Lord embraces everything in His knowledge; - on God do we rely. O our Lord! open between us and between our people in truth, for Thou art the best of those who open
And the chiefs of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, 'If ye follow Shohaib, verily, ye shall be the losers
then there took them the earthquake, and in the morning they lay in their dwellings prone
Those who called Shohaib a liar, (were) as though they had not dwelt therein! - Those who called Shohaib a liar, they were the losers then
And he turned away from them and said, 'O my people! I preached to you the messages of my Lord, and I gave you good advice; how should I be vexed for a people who do misbelieve
We have not sent unto a city any prophet except we overtook the people thereof with trouble and distress, that haply they might humble themselves
and then did we give them, in exchange for evil, good, until they increased and said, 'Distress and joy both touched our fathers;' then we overtook them suddenly ere they could perceive
Had the people of the town but believed and feared, we would have opened up for them blessings from the heavens and from the earth; but they said it was a lie, so we overtook them for that which they had earned
Were the people of these cities then secure that our violence would not come on them by night, while they slept
were the people of these cities secure that our violence would not come on them in the morning whilst they played
were they secure from the craft of God? none feel secure from the craft of God except a people that shall lose
Is it not shown to those who inherit the earth after its (former) people, that, did we please, we would smite them in their sins, and would set a stamp upon their hearts, and then they should not hear
These cities, we do relate to thee their stories. There came to them our apostles with manifest signs; but they did not at all believe in what they called a lie before.- Thus doth God set a stamp upon the hearts of those who misbelieve
Nor did we find in most of them a covenant; but we did find most of them workers of abomination
Then we raised up after them Moses with our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs; but they dealt unjustly therewith, and see what was the end of the evildoers
Moses said, 'O Pharaoh! verily, I am an apostle from the Lord of the worlds
it is not right for me to speak against God aught but the truth. I have come to you with a manifest sign from my Lord; send then the children of Israel with me
Said he, 'If thou hast come with a sign, then bring it, if thou art of those who speak the truth
Then he threw his rod down, and lo! it was an obvious snake
and he drew out his hand, and lo! it was white to the beholders
Said the chiefs of Pharaoh's people, 'Verily, this is surely a knowing magician
he desires to turn you out of your land; - what is it then ye bid
They said, 'Give him and his brother some hope; and send into the cities to collect
and bring you every knowing magician
And the magician came to Pharaoh and said, 'Is there indeed a reward for us if we are conquerors
He said, 'Yea! and ye shall be of those who draw nigh unto me
They said, 'O Moses! wilt thou cast down (thy rod) or shall we be (first) to throw
Said he, 'Throw down;' and when they threw down, they did enchant the people's eyes, and made them dread, and brought a mighty magic
But we inspired Moses (saying), 'Throw down thy rod, and it will gulp down that which they devise
and the truth stood fast, and vain was that which they had done
and they were conquered there, and turned back feeling small
and the magicians threw themselves down adoring
Said they, 'We believe in the Lord of the worlds
the Lord of Moses and Aaron
Said Pharaoh, 'Do ye believe in him ere I give you leave? This is craft which ye have devised in the land, to turn its people out therefrom, but soon shall ye know
I will cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides, then I will crucify you altogether
They said, 'Verily, we unto our Lord return
nor dost thou take vengeance on us, save for that we believe in the signs of our Lord, when they come to us. 'O our Lord! pour out upon us patience, and take us to Thyself resigned
And the chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, 'Will ye leave Moses and his people, to do evil in the land, and to leave thee and thy gods?' Said he, 'We will have their sons slain and their women we will let live, for, verily, we are triumphant over them
Said Moses unto his people, 'Ask for aid from God and be patient; verily, the earth is God's! He gives it for an inheritance to whom He pleases of His servants, and the future is for those who fear
They said, 'We have been hurt before thou didst come to us, and since thou hast come to us.' Said he, 'It may be that your Lord will destroy your foe, and will make you succeed him in the earth; and He will see how ye act
We had overtaken Pharaoh's people with the years (of dearth) and scarcity of fruits, that haply they might remember
but when there came to them a good thing they said, 'This is ours;' and if there befell them an evil, they took the augury from Moses and those with him; - is not their augury only in God's hands? - but most of them know not
And they said, 'Whatever thou dost bring us as a sign to enchant us therewith, yet will we not believe in thee
Then we sent upon them the flood and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and the blood, - signs detailed; but they were big with pride and were a people who did sin
And when there fell upon them the plague, they said, 'O Moses! call upon thy Lord for us, as He has covenanted with thee; verily, if thou dost remove the plague from us, we will believe in thee; and we will assuredly send with thee the children of Israel
But when we removed from them the plague until the appointed time which they should reach, lo! then they broke their promise
But we took vengeance on them, and we drowned them in the sea, for that they said our signs were lies and were careless thereof
And we gave as an inheritance unto the people who had been weak, the eastern quarters of the earth and the western quarters thereof, which we had blest; and the good word of thy Lord was fulfilled on the children of Israel, for that they were patient; and we destroyed that which Pharaoh and his people had made and that which they had piled
And with the children of Israel we passed across the sea; and they came unto a people devoted to their idols, and said, 'O Moses! make for us a god as they have gods.' Said he, 'Verily, ye are ignorant people
Verily, these - destroyed shall be that which they are given to; and vain is that which they have done
He said, 'Other than God then do ye crave for a god, when He has preferred you above the worlds
And when we saved you from Pharaoh's people who wrought you evil woe, killing your sons, and letting your women live; and in that was a mighty trial from your Lord
And we appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed them with ten (more), so that the time appointed by his Lord was completed to forty nights. And Moses said unto his brother Aaron, 'Be thou my vicegerent amongst my people, and do what is right, and follow not the path of the evildoers
And when Moses came to our appointment, and his Lord spake unto him, he said, 'O my Lord! show me, - that I may look on thee!' He said, Thou canst not see me; but look upon the mountain, and if it remain steady in its place, thou shalt see me;' but when his Lord appeared unto the mountain He made it dust, and Moses fell down in a swoon! And when he came to himself, he said, 'Celebrated be thy praise! I turn repentant unto Thee, and I am the first of those who are resigned
He said, 'O Moses! verily, I have chosen thee over the people with my messages and my words, take then what I have brought thee, and be of those who thank
And we wrote for him upon tablets an admonition concerning everything, and a detailing of everything: 'Take them then with firmness, and bid thy people take them for what is best thereof. I will show you the abode of those who work abominations
I will turn from my signs those who are big with pride in the earth without right; and if they see every sign they shall not believe therein, and if they see the path of rectitude they shall not take it for a path; but if they see the path of error they shall take it for a path; - that is because they have said our signs are lies and have been careless of them
But those who say our signs and the meeting of the last day are lies,-- vain are their works: shall they be rewarded save for that which they have done
And Moses' people after him took to themselves of their ornaments a corporeal calf that lowed; did they not see that it could not speak with them, nor could it guide them in the path? They took it and they were unjust
but when they bit their hands with fruitless rage and saw that they had gone astray, they said,' Verily, if our Lord have not compassion on us and forgive us we shall surely be of those who lose
And when Moses returned unto his people angry and grieved, he said, 'Evil is it that ye have done after me! Would ye hasten on the bidding of your Lord?' and he threw down the tablets and took his brother by the head to drag him towards him, but he said, 'O son of my mother! verily, the people weakened me and well-nigh killed me; make not then mine enemies glad about me, and put me not with the unjust people
He said, 'O Lord! pardon me and my brother, and let us enter into Thy mercy; for Thou art the most merciful of the merciful
Verily, these have taken to themselves a calf; there shall reach them wrath from their Lord, and abasement in the life of this world; for thus do we reward those who forge a lie
But those who have done bad works, and then turn again after them and believe,- verily, thy Lord, after that, is forgiving and merciful
And when Moses' wrath calmed down he took the tables, in the inscription of which was guidance and mercy for those who dread their Lord
And Moses chose from his people seventy men for our appointment; and when the earthquake took them he said, 'O my Lord! hadst Thou willed, Thou hadst destroyed them before and me. Wilt Thou destroy us for what the fools amongst us have done? This is naught but Thy trial, wherewith Thou dost lead astray whom Thou pleasest and guidest whom Thou pleasest; Thou art our patron! forgive us and have mercy on us, for Thou art the best of those who do forgive
And write down for us in this world good, and in the future too; verily, we are guided unto Thee.' He said, 'My punishment - with it I fall on whom I will; and my mercy embraceth everything; and I will write it down for those who fear, and who give alms, and those who in our signs believe
who follow the Apostle - the illiterate prophet, whom they find written down with them in the law and the gospel, bidding them what is reasonable and forbidding them what is wrong, and making lawful for them what is good, and making unlawful evil things; and setting down for them their burdens and the yokes which were upon them; - to those who believe in him and aid him and help him and follow the law which has been sent down with him - they shall be the prosperous
Say, 'O ye folk! verily, I am the Apostle of God unto you all' -, of Him whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, there is no god but He! He quickens and He kills! believe then in God and His Apostle, the illiterate prophet,- who believes in God and in His words - then follow him that haply ye may be guided
Amongst Moses' people is a nation guided in truth, and thereby act they justly
And we cut them up into twelve tribes, each a nation; and we revealed unto Moses, when his people asked him for drink, 'Strike with thy staff the rock!' and there gushed forth from it twelve springs, each folk knew their drinking place. And we overshadowed them with the cloud; and sent down upon them the manna and the quails, 'Eat of the good things we have provided you with!' - Yet they did not wrong us, but it was themselves they wronged
And when it was said unto them, 'Dwell in this city and eat therefrom as ye will, and say 'hittatun and enter the gate adoring; so will we pardon you your sins; - we will increase those who do well
But those amongst them who did wrong changed it for another word than which was said to them; and we sent upon them a plague from heaven for that they were unjust
Ask them too about the city which stood by the sea, when they transgressed upon the Sabbath; when their fish came to them on the Sabbath day sailing straight up to them; but on the days when they kept not the Sabbath, they came not to them, thus did we try them for the abominations that they wrought
And when a nation from amongst them said, 'Why do ye warn a people whom God would destroy, or punish with severe torment?' they said, 'As an excuse to your Lord, that haply they may fear
But when they forgot what they had been reminded of, we saved those who forbade evil, but we overtook those who did wrong with punishment; - evil was the abomination that they did
but when they rebelled against what they were forbidden, we said to them, 'Become ye apes, despised and spurned
and then thy Lord proclaimed that He would surely send against them till the resurrection day, those who should wreak them evil torment; verily, thy Lord is quick at following up, but, verily, He is forgiving, merciful
We cut them up in the earth into nations. Of them are the righteous, and of them are the reverse of that; we have tried them with good things and with bad things; haply they may return
But there succeeded them successors who inherited the Book! They take the goods of this lower world and say, 'It will be forgiven us.' But if the like goods came to them they would take them too! Was there not taken from them a covenant by the Book, that they should not say against God aught but the truth? Yet they study therein! But the abode of the future life is better for those who fear - do ye not then understand
But those who hold fast by the Book and are steadfast in prayer - verily, we will not waste the hire of those who do right
And when we shook the mountain over them, as though it were a shadow, and they thought it would fall upon them (saying), 'Take ye what we have given you with firmness, and remember what is therein; haply ye may fear
And when thy Lord took from the children of Adam out of their loins their seed, and made them bear witness against themselves, ' Am I not your Lord?' They said, 'Yea! we do bear witness' - lest ye should say on the day of resurrection, 'Verily, for this we did not care
or say, 'Verily, our fathers associated others with God before us, and we were but their seed after them: wilt Thou then destroy us for what vaindoers did
Thus do we detail the signs; haply they may return
Read to them the declaration of him to whom we brought our signs, and who stepped away therefrom, and Satan followed him, and he was of those who were beguiled
Had we pleased we would have exalted him thereby, but lie crouched upon the earth and followed his lust, and his likeness was as the likeness of a dog, whom if thou shouldst attack he hangs out his tongue, or if thou should leave him, hangs out his tongue too. That is the likeness of the people who say our signs are lies. Tell them then these tales - haply they may reflect
Evil is the likeness of a people who say our signs are lies; themselves it is they wrong
Whoever Allah guides - he is the [rightly] guided; and whoever He sends astray - it is those who are the losers
We have created for hell many of the ginn and of mankind; they have hearts and they discern not therewith; they have eyes and they see not therewith; they have ears and they hear not therewith; they are like cattle, nay, they go more astray! these it is who care not
But God's are the good names; call on Him then thereby, and leave those who pervert His names; they shall be rewarded for that which they have done
And of those whom we have created is a nation who are guided in truth and thereby act with equity
but they who say our signs are lies, we will bring them down by degrees from whence they know not
I will let them range; - verily, my stratagem is efficacious
Do they not then reflect that their companion is not possessed? he is but an obvious warner
Do they not behold the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth, and what things God has created, and (see that), it may be, their time is already drawing nigh? in what relation then will they believe
He whom God leads astray there is no guide for him! He leaves them in their rebellion, blindly wandering on
They will ask you about the Hour, for what time it is fixed? - say, 'The knowledge thereof is only with my Lord; none shall manifest it at its time but He; it is heavy in the heavens and the earth, it will not come to you save on a sudden.' They will ask as though thou wert privy to it, say, 'The knowledge thereof is only with God,' - but most folk do not know
Say, 'I cannot control profit or harm for myself, save what God will. If I knew the unseen I should surely have much that is good, nor would evil touch me; I am but a warner and a herald of good tidings unto a people who believe
He it is who created you from one soul, and made therefrom its mate to dwell therewith; and when he covered her she bore a light burden and went about therewith; but when it grew heavy they called on God, Lord of them both, 'Surely if thou givest us a rightly-shaped child we shall of a surety be of those who thank
And when He gave them both a rightly-shaped child they joined partners with Him for that which He had given them, but exalted be God above that which they associate with Him
Will they associate with Him those who cannot create aught, but are themselves created
which have no power to help them, and cannot even help themselves
But if ye call them unto guidance they will not follow you. It is the same to them if Thou dost call them or if Thou dost hold thy tongue
Those whom ye call on other than God are servants like yourselves. Call on them then, and let them answer you, if so be ye tell the truth
Have they feet to walk with? or have they hands to hold with? or have they eyes to see with? or have they ears to hear with? Call upon your partners; then plot against me, and do not wait
Verily, my patron is God, who hath sent down the Book, and He is the patron of the righteous
But those whom ye call on beside Him cannot help you, nor can they even help themselves
But if ye call them unto the guidance they will not hear, thou mayest see them looking towards thee, yet they do not see
Take to pardon, and order what is kind, and shun the ignorant
and if an incitement from the devil incites you, then seek refuge in God: verily, He both hears and knows
Verily, those who fear God, if a wraith from the devil touch, mention Him, and lo! they see
And their brethren he shall increase in error, then they shall not desist
Shouldst Thou not bring them a sign they say, 'Hast Thou not yet made choice of one?' Say, 'I only follow what is inspired to me by my Lord. These are perceptions from my Lord, and a guidance and a mercy to a people who believe
And when the Qur'an is read, then listen thereto and keep silence; haply ye may obtain mercy
And remember thy Lord within thyself humbly and with fear, not openly in words, in the morning and in the evening; and be not of those who do not care
Verily, they who are with my Lord are not too big with pride for His service, but they do celebrate His praise, and Him they do adore
They will ask thee about the spoils. Say, 'The spoils are God's and the Apostle's; fear God and settle it amongst yourselves; obey God and the Apostle if ye do believe
Verily, the believers are those who, when God's name is mentioned, their hearts sink with fear; and when His signs are rehearsed to them they increase them in faith; and on their Lord do they rely
who are steadfast in prayer, and of what we have bestowed upon them give in alms
these are in truth believers; to them are degrees with their Lord, and forgiveness, and a generous provision
As thy Lord caused thee to go forth from thy house with the truth, although a sect of the believers were averse therefrom
They wrangled with thee about the truth after it was made plain, as though they were being driven on to death and looked thereon
and when God promised you that one of the two troops should be yours, and ye would fain have had those who had no arms. God wished to prove the truth true by His words, and to cut off the hindermost parts of those who misbelieve
to prove the truth true, and to make vain the vain, although the sinners are averse
When ye asked for succour from your Lord, and He answered you, 'I will assist you with a thousand angels, with others in reserve
God made it only glad tidings to quiet your hearts therewith; for victory is only from God! verily, God is mighty and wise
When drowsiness covered you as a security from Him, and He sent down upon you from the heavens water to purify you withal, and to take away from you the plague of Satan, and to tie up your hearts and to make firm your footsteps
When your Lord inspired the angels - 'Verily, I am with you; make ye firm then those who believe; I will cast dread into the hearts of those who misbelieve,- strike off their necks then, and strike off from them every finger tip
That is, because they went into opposition against God and His Apostle; for he who goes into opposition against God and His Apostle - verily, God is keen to punish
There, taste it! since for the misbelievers is the torment of the Fire
O ye who believe! when ye meet those who misbelieve in swarms, turn not to them your hinder parts
for he who turns to them that day his hinder parts, save turning to fight or rallying to a troop, brings down upon himself wrath from God, and his resort is hell, and an ill journey shall it be
Ye did not slay them, but it was God who slew them; nor didst thou shoot when thou didst shoot, but God did shoot, to try the believers from Himself with a goodly trial; verily, God both hears and knows
There! verily, God weakens the stratagem of the misbelievers
If ye wish the matter to be decided, a decision has now come to you; but if ye desist, it is better for you; and if ye turn back we will turn too, and your troop shall avail nothing, great in number though it be, since God is with the believers
O ye who believe! obey God and His Apostle, and turn not from Him while ye hear
and be not like those who say, 'We hear,' and yet they hear not
Verily, the worst of beasts in God's sight are the deaf, the dumb who do not understand
Had God known any good in them, He would have made them hear; but had He made them hear, they would have turned back and have swerved aside
O ye who believe! answer God and His Apostle when He calls you to that which quickens you; and know that God steps in between man and his heart; and that to Him ye shall be gathered
And fear temptation, which will not light especially on those of you who have done wrong; but know that God is keen to punish
Remember when ye were few in number and weak in the land, fearing lest people should snatch you away; then He sheltered you and aided you with victory, and provided you with good things; haply ye may give thanks
O ye who believe! be not treacherous to God and His Apostle; nor be treacherous to your engagement while ye know
Know that your wealth and your children are but a temptation, and that God - with Him is mighty hire
O ye who believe! if ye fear God He will make for you a discrimination, and will cover for you your offences, and will forgive you; for God is Lord of mighty grace
And when those who misbelieve were crafty with thee to detain thee a prisoner, or kill thee, or drive thee forth; they were crafty, but God was crafty too, for God is best of crafty ones
But when our verses were rehearsed to them they said, 'We have already heard.- If we pleased we could speak like this; verily, this is nothing but tales of those of yore
When they said, 'O God! if this be truth, and from Thee, then rain upon us stones from heaven or bring us grievous woe
But God would not torment them while thou art amongst them; nor was God going to torment them while they asked Him to forgive
But what ails them that God should not torment them while they turn folk away from the Holy Mosque, though they are not the guardians thereof - its guardians are only the pious?- but most of them know not
Their prayer at the House was naught but whistling and clapping hands!- taste then the torment for that ye misbelieved
Verily, those who misbelieve expend their wealth to turn folk from the path of God; but they shall spend it, and then it shall be for them sighing, and then they shall be overcome! Those who misbelieve, into hell shall they be gathered
that God may distinguish the vile from the good, and may put the vile, some on the top of the other, and heap all up together, and put it into hell!- These are those who lose
Say to those who misbelieve, if they desist they will be forgiven what is past; but if they return,- the course of those of former days has passed away
Fight them then that there should be no sedition, and that the religion may be wholly God's; but if they desist, then God on what they do doth look
But if they turn their backs, then know that God is your Lord; a good Lord is He, and a good help
and know that whenever ye seize anything as a spoil, to God belongs a fifth thereof, and to His Apostle, and to kindred and orphans, and the poor and the wayfarer; if ye believe in God and what we have revealed unto our servants on the day of the discrimination,- the day when the two parties met; and God is mighty over all
When ye were on the near side of the valley, and they were on the far side, and the camels were below you; had ye made an appointment then ye would have failed to keep your appointment - but it was that God might accomplish a thing that was as good as done! that he who was to perish might perish with a manifest sign; and that he who was to live might live with a manifest sign; for, verily, God hears and knows
When God showed thee them in thy dream as though they were but few; but had He shown thee them as though they were many, ye would have been timid, and ye would have quarrelled about the matter;- but God preserved you; verily, He knows the nature of men's breasts
And when He showed them to you, as ye encountered them, as few in your eyes; and made you seem few in their eyes; that God might accomplish a thing that was as good as done; for unto God do things return
O ye who believe! when ye encounter a troop, then stand firm and remember God; and haply ye may prosper
and fear God and His Apostle, and do not quarrel or be timid, so that your turn of luck go from you; but be ye patient, verily, God is with the patient
And be not like those who went forth from their homes with insolence, and for appearance sake before men, and to turn folks off God's way; for all they do God comprehends
And when Satan made their works appear seemly to them, and said, 'There is none amongst mankind to conquer you today, for, verily, I am your neighbour!' and when the two troops came in sight of each other, he turned upon his heels and said, 'Verily, I am clear of you! verily, I see what you see not! verily, I fear God, for God is keen to punish
And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was sickness said, 'Their religion hath beguiled these men, but he who relies upon God, verily, God is mighty and wise
Couldst thou see when the angels take away the souls of those who misbelieve; they smite them on their faces and hinder parts.- 'Taste ye the torment of burning
that is for what your hands have sent on before; and for that God is no unjust one towards his servants
As was the wont of Pharaoh's people and those before them! they disbelieved in the signs of God, and God overtook them in their sins; verily, God is strong and keen to punish
That is because God is not one to change a favour He has favoured a people with, until they change what they have in themselves, and for that God both hears and knows
As was the wont of Pharaoh's people and those before them! they said our signs were lies, and we destroyed them in their sins, and drowned Pharaoh's people; and all of them were evildoers
Verily, the worst of beasts in God's eyes are those who misbelieve and will not believe
with whom if thou dost make a league, they break their league each time, for they fear not God
but shouldst thou ever catch them in war, then make those who come after them run by their example, haply they may remember then
And shouldst thou ever fear from any people treachery, then throw it back to them in like manner; verily, God loves not the treacherous
Deem not that those who misbelieve can win; verily, they cannot make (God) powerless
Prepare ye against them what force and companies of horse ye can, to make the enemies of God, and your enemies, and others beside them, in dread thereof. Ye do not know them, but God knows them! and whatever ye expend in God's way He will repay you; and ye shall not be wronged
But if they incline to peace, incline thou to it too, and rely upon God; verily, He both hears and knows
But if they wish to betray thee, then God is enough for thee! He it is who supports thee with His help and with the believers
and reconciles their hearts! Didst thou expend all that is in the earth thou couldst not reconcile their hearts, but God reconciled them, verily, He is mighty and wise
O thou prophet ! God is sufficient for thee, with those of the believers who follow thee
O thou prophet! urge on the believers to fight. If there be of you twenty patient men, they shall conquer two hundred; if there be of you a hundred, they shall conquer a thousand of those who misbelieve, because they are a people who did not discern
Now has God made it light for you; He knows that there is a weakness amongst you: but if there be amongst you but a patient hundred, they will conquer two hundred; and if there be of you a thousand, they will conquer two thousand, by the permission of God,- for God is with the patient
It has not been for any prophet to take captives until he hath slaughtered in the land! Ye wish to have the goods of this world, but God wishes for the next, for God is mighty, wise
Were it not for a book from God that had gone before, there would have touched you, for that which ye took, a mighty punishment
Eat of what spoils ye have taken, what is lawful and good; and fear God, verily, God is forgiving and merciful
O thou prophet! say to such of the captives as are in your hands, 'If God knows of any good in your hearts, he will give you better than that which is taken from you, and will forgive you; for God is forgiving and merciful
But if they desire to betray thee,- they have betrayed God before! but He hath given you power over them; for God is knowing, wise
Verily, those who believe and have fled and fought strenuously with their wealth and persons in God's way, and those who have given refuge and help, these shall be next of kin to each other. But those who believe, but have not fled, ye have naught to do with their claims of kindred, until they flee as well. But if they ask you for aid for religion's sake, then help is due from you, except against a people between whom and you there is an alliance; for God on what ye do doth look
And those who misbelieve, some of them are next of kin to others - unless ye act the same there will be sedition in the land, and great corruption
Those who believe and have fled and fought strenuously in God's cause, and those who have given a refuge and a help, those it is who believe; to them is forgiveness and generous provision due
And those who have believed afterwards and have fled and fought strenuously with you; these too are of you, but blood relations are nearer in kin by the Book of God. Verily, God all things doth know
AN immunity from God and His Apostle to those idolaters with whom ye have made a league
Roam ye at large in the land for four months, but know that ye cannot make God helpless, and that God disgraces the misbelievers
A proclamation from God and His Apostle to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage, that God is clear of the idolaters as is His Apostle! If then ye repent it is better for you; but if ye turn your backs, then know that ye cannot make God helpless. Give to those who misbelieve glad tidings of grievous woe
Except to those of the idolaters with whom ye have made a league, and who then have not failed you at all, and have not backed up any one against you. Fulfill for them then your covenant until the time agreed upon with them; verily, God loves those who fear
But when the sacred months are passed away, kill the idolaters wherever ye may find them; and take them, and besiege them, and lie in wait for them in every place of observation; but if they repent, and are steadfast in prayer, and give alms, then let them go their way; verily, God is forgiving and merciful
And if any one of the idolaters ask thee for aid, then aid him, in order that he may hear the word of God; then let him reach his place of safety,- that is, because they are a folk who do not know
How can there be for the idolaters a treaty with God and with His Apostle, save those with whom ye have made a league at the Sacred Mosque! Then while they stand by you, stand ye by them; verily, God loves those who fear
How!- if they prevail against you, they will not observe either ties of blood or ties of client ship; they please you with their mouths, but their hearts refuse; and most of them do work abomination
They barter God's signs for a little price, and they turn folk from His way; verily, they - evil is that which they have done
They will not observe in a believer ties of kindred nor ties of clientship; but they it is are the transgressors
But if they repent and are steadfast in prayer and give alms, then they are your brethren in religion - we detail the signs unto a people that do know
But if they break faith with you after their treaty, and taunt your religion, then fight the leaders of misbelief; verily, they have no faith, haply they may desist
Will ye not fight a people who broke their oaths, and intended to expel the Apostle? They began with you at first, are ye afraid of them? God is more deserving that ye should fear Him! If ye be believers
kill them! God will torment them by your hands, and disgrace them, and aid you against them, and heal the breasts of a people who believe
and will remove rage from their hearts; for God turns unto Him whomsoever He pleases, and God is knowing, wise
Did ye reckon that ye would be left, when God knows not as yet those of you who fought strenuously, and who did not take other than God and His Apostle, and the believers for an intimate friend? for God is well aware of what ye do
It is not for idolaters to repair to the mosques of God, bearing witness against themselves to unbelief; they it is whose works are vain, and in the Fire shall they dwell for, aye
He only shall repair to the mosques of God who believes in God and the last day, and is steadfast in prayer, and gives the alms, and fears only God;- it may be that these will be of those who are guided
Have ye made out the giving drink to the pilgrims and the repairing to the Sacred Mosque to be like being one who believes in God and in the last day, and is strenuous in the way of God?- they are not equal in God's sight, and God guides not an unjust people

The Jews say Ezra is the son of God; and the Christians say that the Messiah is the son of God; that is what they say with their mouths, imitating the sayings of those who misbelieved before.- God fight them! how they lie

Verily, the number of months with God is twelve months in God's Book, on the day when He created the heavens and the earth; of these are four that are sacred; that is the subsisting religion. Then do not wrong yourselves therein, but fight the idolaters, one and all, as they fight you one and all, and know that God is with those who fear
Verily, putting off is but an increase in misbelief to lead astray therewith those who misbelieve. They make it lawful one year, but they make it unlawful another year, that they may come to an understanding as to the number which God has made sacred, and make lawful what God has prohibited. Seemly to them are their evil works, but God guides not a misbelieving people

Of them are some who defame thee, with respect to alms; though if they are given a part thereof, they are content; and if they are not given a part thereof, then are they in a rage
Would that they were content with what God and His Apostle had brought them, and would say, 'God is enough for us! God will bring us of His grace, and so will His Apostle; verily, unto God is our desire
Alms are only for the poor and needy, and those who work for them, and those whose hearts are reconciled, and those in captivity, and those in debt, and those who are on God's path, and for the wayfarer;- an ordinance this from God, for God is knowing, wise
And of them are some who are by the ears with the prophet, and say, 'He is all ear.' Say, 'An ear of good for you!' he believes in God, and believes in those who do believe, and is a mercy unto such of you as believe; but those who are by the ears with the Apostle of God, for them is grievous woe

Make no excuse! Ye have misbelieved after your faith; if we forgive one sect of you, we will torment another sect, for that they sinned
The hypocrites, men and women, some of them follow others, bidding what is wrong and forbidding what is right, and they clench their hands. They forget God and He forgets them! Verily, the hypocrites, they are the doers of abomination
God has promised unto the hypocrites, men and women, and unto the misbelievers, hell-fire, to dwell therein for aye; it is enough for them! God shall curse them, and theirs shall be enduring woe
Ye are like those who were before you. They were stronger than you and more abundant in wealth and children; they enjoyed their portion then, and ye enjoy your portion, as they enjoyed their portion before you; and ye discuss as they discussed. Their works are vain in this world and the next, and they it is who lose
Did there not come to them the declaration of those who were before them? of the people of Noah and 'Ad and Thamud, and of the people of Abraham, and the people of Midian? and of the overturned (cities)? Their apostles came to them with manifest signs; for God would not wrong them, but it was themselves they wronged

And of them are some who make a treaty with God, that 'If He bring us of His grace, we will give alms and we will surely be among the righteous
But when He gave them of His grace they were niggardly thereof, and turned their backs and swerved aside

Do they not know that God knows their secrets and their whisperings, and that God knows the unseen things
Those who defame such of the believers as willingly give their alms, and such as can find nothing to give but their exertions, and who mock at them,- God will mock at them, and for them is grievous woe
Ask forgiveness for them or ask not forgiveness, for them! if they shouldst ask forgiveness for them seventy times, yet would not God forgive them; that is because they disbelieved in God and His Apostle, for God guides not a people who work abomination
Those who were left behind rejoiced in staying behind the Apostle of God, and were averse from fighting strenuously with their wealth and their persons in God's way, and said, 'March not forth in the heat.' Say, 'The fire of hell is hotter still, if ye could but discern

R
Those are the signs of the wise Book! was it a wonder to the folk I that we inspired a man from amongst themselves, 'Warn thou the folk; and give glad tidings to those who believe, that for them there is an advance of sincerity gone before them with their Lord?' The misbelievers say, 'Verily, this is an obvious sorcerer

Verily, the likeness of this world's life is like water which we send down from the sky, and the plants of the earth, from which men and cattle eat, are mingled therewith; until when the earth puts on its gilding and is adorned, the people thereof think that they have power over it.

But most of them follow only suspicion; verily, suspicion does not avail against the truth at all; verily, God knows what they do
This Qur'an could not have been devised by any beside God; but it verifies that which was before it, and details the Book - there is no doubt therein - from the Lord of the worlds

Either we will show thee something of that with which we threatened them, or we will take thee to ourself, for unto us is their return; then is God a witness to what they do
Every nation has its apostle; and when their apostle comes to them, it is decided between them with justice, and they are not wronged
But they say, 'When is this threat (to come), if ye tell the truth
Say, 'I have no power over myself for harm or for profit, save what God will. Every nation has its appointed time; when their appointed time comes to them they cannot delay it for an hour or bring it on

When the youths resorted to the cave and said, 'O our Lord! bring us mercy from Thee, and dispose for us our affair aright
And we struck their ears (with deafness) in the cave for a number of years
Then we raised them up again, that we might know which of the two crews could best calculate the time of their tarrying
We will narrate to thee their story in truth. Verily, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and we added to their guidance
and we braced up their hearts, when they stood up and said, 'Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, we will not call upon any god beside Him, for then we should have said an extravagant thing
These people of ours have taken to other gods beside Him. Though they do not bring any manifest authority for them. And who is more unjust than he who forges against God a lie
So when ye have gone apart from them and what they serve other than God, then resort ye to the cave. Our Lord will unfold His mercy to you, and will dispose for you your affair advantageously
And thou mightst have seen the sun when it rose decline from their cave towards the right hand, and when it set leave them on the left hand, while they were in the spacious part thereof. That is one of the signs of God. Whom God guides he is guided indeed, and whom He leads astray thou shalt surely find for him no patron to guide aright
Thou mightst have reckoned them waking though they were sleeping, as we turned them towards the right and towards the left; and their dog spreading out his fore-paws on the threshold. Hadst thou come suddenly upon them thou wouldst surely have turned and fled away from them, and wouldst surely have been filled by them with dread
Thus did we raise them up that they might question each other. Spake a speaker amongst them, 'How long have ye tarried?' They said, 'We have tarried a day or part of a day.' They said, 'Your Lord knows best your tarrying; so send one of you with this coin of yours to the city, and let him look which of them has purest food, and let him bring you provision thereof; and let him be subtle and not let any one perceive you
Verily, they - should they perceive you - would stone you, or would force you back again unto their faith, and ye would never prosper then
Thus did we make their people acquainted with their story, that they might know that God's promise is true; and that the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When they disputed amongst themselves concerning their affair, and said, 'Build a building over them, their Lord knows best about them;' and those who prevailed in their affair said, 'We will surely make a mosque over them
They will say, 'Three, and the fourth of them was their dog:' and they will say, 'Five, and the sixth of them was their dog:' guessing at the unseen: and they will say, 'Seven, and the eighth of them was their dog.' Say, 'My Lord knows best the number of them; none knows them but few.' Dispute not therefore concerning them save with a plain disputation, and ask not any one of them concerning them
And never say of anything, 'Verily, I am going to do that to-morrow
except 'if God please;' and remember thy Lord when thou hast forgotten, and say,' It may be that my Lord will guide me to what is nearer to the right than this
They tarried in their cave three hundred years and nine more
Say, 'God knows best of their tarrying. His are the unseen things of the heavens and the earth - He can see! and hear!' They have no patron beside Him, nor does He let any one share in His judgment
So, recite what thou art inspired with of the Book of thy Lord; there is no changing His words; nor shalt thou ever find a refuge beside Him
and keep thyself patient, with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, desiring His face; nor let thine eyes be turned from them, desiring the adornment of the life of this world; and obey not him whose heart we have made heedless of remembrance of us, and who follows his lusts, for his affair is ever in advance (of the truth)
But say, 'The truth is from your Lord, so let him who will, believe; and let him who will, disbelieve.' Verily, we have prepared for the evildoers a fire, sheets of which shall encompass them; and if they cry for help, they shall be helped with water like molten brass, which shall roast their faces: - an ill drink and an evil couch
Verily, those who believe and act aright,- verily, we will not waste the hire of him who does good works
These, for them are gardens of Eden; beneath them rivers flow; they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and shall wear green robes of silk, and of brocade; reclining therein on thrones;- pleasant is the reward, and goodly the couch
Strike out for them a parable: Two men, for one of whom we made two gardens of grapes, and surrounded them with palms, and put corn between the two
Each of the two gardens brought forth its food and did not fail in aught. And we caused a river to gush forth amidst them
and he had fruit, and said unto his fellow, who was his next-door neighbour, 'I am more wealthy than thee, and mightier of household
And he went in unto his garden, having wronged himself: said he, 'I do not think that this will ever disappear
and I do not think that the hour is imminent; and if even I be sent back unto my Lord, I shall find a better one than it in exchange
Said unto him his fellow, who was his next-door neighbour, 'Thou hast disbelieved in Him who created thee from earth, and then from a clot, then fashioned thee a man
but, God, He is my Lord; nor will I associate any one with my Lord
Why couldst thou not have said, when thou didst go into thy garden, "What God pleases! there is no power save in God," - to look at, I am less than thee in wealth and children
but haply my Lord will give me something better than thy garden, and will send upon it thunder-claps from the sky, and it shall be on the morrow bare slippery soil
or on the morrow its water may be deeply sunk, so that thou canst not get thereat
And his fruits were encompassed, and on the morrow he turned down the palms of his hands for what he had spent thereon, for it was fallen down upon its trellises. And he said, 'Would that I had never associated any one with my Lord
And he had not any party to help him beside God, nor was he helped
In such a case the patronage is God's, the true; He is best at rewarding and best at bringing to an issue
Strike out for them, too, a parable of the life of this world; like water which we send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth is mingled therewith; - and on the morrow it is dried up, and the winds scatter it; for God is powerful over all
Wealth and children are an adornment of the life of this world; but enduring good works are better with thy Lord, as a recompense, and better as a hope
And the day when we will move the mountains, and thou shalt see the (whole) earth stalking forth; and we will gather them, and will not leave one of them behind
Then shall they be presented to thy Lord in ranks. - Now have ye come to us as we created you at first! nay, but ye thought that we would never make our promise good
And the Book shall be placed, and thou shalt see the sinners in fear of what is in it; and they will say, ' Alas, for us! what ails this Book, it leaves neither small nor great things alone, without numbering them?' and they shall find present what they have done; and thy Lord will not wrong any one
And when we said to the angels, ' Adore Adam,' they adored him, save only Iblis, who was of the ginn, who revolted from the bidding of his Lord. 'What! will ye then take him and his seed as patrons, rather than me, when they are foes of yours? bad for the wrong-doers is the exchange
I did not make them witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of the creation of themselves, nor did I take those who lead astray for my supporters
On the day when He shall say, 'Call ye my partners whom ye pretend:' and they shall call on them, but they shall not answer them; and we will set the vale of perdition between them
and the sinners shall see the fire, and shall think that they are going to fall therein, and shall find no escape therefrom
We have turned about in this Qur'an for men every parable; but man is ever at most things a caviller
Naught prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, or from asking pardon of their Lord, except the coming on them of the course of those of yore, or the coming of the torment before their eyes
We sent not prophets save as heralds of glad tidings and as warners; but those who misbelieve wrangle with vain speech to make void the truth therewith; and they take my signs and the warnings given them as a jest
Who is more unjust than he who, being reminded of the signs of his Lord, turns away therefrom, and forgets what his hands have done before? verily, we will place veils upon their hearts lest they should understand, and dullness in their ears! And if thou shouldst call them to the guidance, they will not be guided then for ever
But thy Lord is forgiving, endowed with mercy; were He to punish them for what they have earned He would have hastened for them the torment. Nay rather, they have their appointed time, and shall never find a refuge beside Him
These cities, we destroyed them when they were unjust; and for their destruction we set an appointed time
And when Moses said to his servant, 'I will not cease until I reach the confluence of the two seas, or else I will go on for years
But when they reached the confluence of the two they forgot their fish, and it took its way in the sea with a free course
And when they had passed by, he said to his servant, 'Bring us our dinners, for we have met with toil from this journey of ours
Said he, 'What thinkest thou? when we resorted to the rock, then, verily, I forgot the fish, but it was only Satan who made me forget it, lest I should remember it; and it took its way in the set wondrously
Said he, 'This is what we were searching for.' So they turned back upon their footsteps, following them up
Then they found a servant of our servants, to whom we had given mercy from ourselves, and had taught him knowledge from before us
Said Moses to him, 'Shall I follow thee, so that thou mayest teach me, from what thou hast been taught, the right way
said he, 'Verily, thou canst never have patience with me
How canst thou be patient in what thou comprehendest no knowledge of
He said, 'Thou wilt find me, if God will, patient; nor will I rebel against thy bidding
He said, 'Then, if thou followest me, ask me not about anything until I begin for them the mention of it
So they set out until when they rode in the bark, he scuttled it. Said he, 'Hast thou scuttled it to drown its crew? Thou hast produced a strange thing
Said he, 'Did I not tell thee, verily, thou canst never have patience with me
Said he, 'Rebuke me not for forgetting, and impose not on me a difficult command
So they set out until they met a boy, and he killed him. And he (Moses) said, 'Hast thou killed a pure person without (his killing) a person? thou hast produced an unheard-of thing
Said he, 'Did I not tell thee, verily, thou canst not have patience with me
Said he, 'If I ask thee about anything after it, then do not accompany me. Now hast thou arrived at my excuse
So they set out until when they came to the people of a city; and they asked the people thereof for food; but they refused to entertain them. And they found therein a wall which wanted to fall to pieces, and he set it upright. Said (Moses), 'Hadst thou pleased thou mightst certainly have had a hire for this
Said he, 'This is the parting between me and thee. I will give thee the interpretation of that with which thou couldst not have patience
As for the bark it belonged to poor people, who toiled on the sea, and I wished to damage it, for behind it was a king who seized on every bark by force
And as for the youth, his parents were believers, and we feared lest he should impose upon them rebellion and misbelief
So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange a better one than him in purity, and nearer in filial affection
And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan youths in the city, and beneath it was a treasure belonging to them both, and their father was a righteous man, and their Lord desired that they should reach puberty, and then take out their treasure as a mercy from thy Lord; and I did it not on my own bidding. That is the interpretation of what thou couldst not have patience with
And they will ask thee about Dhu 'l Qarnain, say, 'I will recite to you a mention of him
verily, we established for him in the earth, and we gave him a way to everything
and he followed a way
until when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a black muddy spring, and he found thereat a people.' We said, 'O Dhu 'l Qarnain! thou mayest either torment these people, or treat them well
Said he, 'As for him who does wrong, I will torment him, then shall be be sent back to his Lord, and He will torment him with An unheard-of torment
but as for him who believes and acts aright, for him is an excellent reward, and we will tell him our easy bidding
Then he followed a way
until when he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rise upon a people to whom we had given no shelter therefrom
So! And we comprehended the knowledge of what (forces) he had with him
Then he followed a way
until when he reached the point between the two mountains, he found below them both a people who could scarcely understand speech
They said, 'O Dhu 'l Qarnain! verily, Yagug and Magug are doing evil in the land. Shall we then pay thee tribute, on condition that thou set between us and them a rampart
He said, 'What my Lord hath established me in is better; so help me with strength, and I will set between you and them a barrier
Bring me pigs of iron until they fill up the space between the two mountain sides.' Said he, 'Blow until it makes it a fire.' Said he, 'Bring me, that I may pour over it, molten brass
So they could not scale it, and they could not tunnel it
Said he, 'This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it as dust, for the promise of my Lord is true
And we left some of them to surge on that day over others, and the trumpet will be blown, and we will gather them together
And we will set forth hell on that day before the misbelievers
whose eyes were veiled from my Reminder, and who were unable to hear
What! did those who misbelieve reckon that they could take my servants for patrons beside me? Verily, we have prepared hell for the misbelievers to alight in
Say, 'Shall we inform you of those who lose most by their works
those who erred in their endeavours after the life of this world, and who think they are doing good deeds
Those who misbelieve in the signs of their Lord and in meeting Him, vain are their works; and we will not give them right weight on the resurrection day
That is their reward, - hell! for that they misbelieved and took my signs and my apostles as a mockery
Verily, those who believe and act aright, for them are gardens of Paradise to alight in
to dwell therein for aye, and they shall crave no change therefrom
Say, 'Were the sea ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would surely fail before the words of my Lord fail; aye, though we brought as much ink again
Say, 'I am only a mortal like yourselves; I am inspired that your God is only one God. Then let him who hopes to meet his Lord act righteous acts, and join none in the service of his Lord
H. Z
The mention of thy Lord's mercy to His servant Zachariah
when he called on his Lord with a secret calling
Said he, 'My Lord! verily, my bones are weak, and my head flares with hoariness; - and I never was unfortunate in my prayers to Thee, my Lord
But I fear my heirs after me, and my wife is barren; then grant me from Thee a successor
to be my heir and the heir of the family of Jacob, and make him, my Lord! acceptable
O Zachariah! verily, we, give thee glad tidings of a son, whose name shall be John. We never made a namesake of his before
Said he, 'My Lord! how can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have reached through old age to decrepitude
He said, 'Thus says thy Lord, It is easy for Me, for I created thee at first when yet thou wast nothing
Said he, 'O my Lord! make for me a sign.' He said, 'Thy sign is that thou shalt not speak to men for three nights (though) sound
Then he went forth unto his people from the chamber, and he made signs to them: 'Celebrate (God's) praises morning and evening
O John! take the Book with strength;' and we gave him judgment when a boy
and grace from us, and purity; and he was pious
and righteous to his parents, and was not a rebellious tyrant

And mention, in the Book, Mary; when she retired from her family into an eastern place

Said she, 'Verily, I take refuge in the Merciful One from thee, if thou art pious
Said he, 'I am only a messenger of thy Lord to bestow on thee a pure boy
Said she, 'How can I have a boy when no man has touched me, and when I am no harlot
He said, 'Thus says thy Lord, It is easy for Me! and we will make him a sign unto man, and a mercy from us; for it is a decided matter
So she conceived him, and she retired with him into a remote place
And the labour pains came upon her at the trunk of a palm tree, and she said, 'O that I had died before this, and been forgotten out of mind
and he called to her from beneath her, 'Grieve not, for thy Lord has placed a stream beneath thy feet
and shake towards thee the trunk of the palm tree, it will drop upon thee fresh dates fit to gather
so eat, and drink, and cheer thine eye; and if thou shouldst see any mortal say, "Verily, I have vowed to the Merciful One a fast, and I will not speak today with a human being
Then she brought it to her people, carrying it; said they, 'O Mary! thou hast done an extraordinary thing
O sister of Aaron! thy father was not a bad man, nor was thy mother a harlot
And she pointed to him, and they said, 'How are we to speak with one who is in the cradle a child
He said, 'Verily, I am a servant of God; He has brought me the Book, and He has made me a prophet
and He has made me blessed wherever I be; and He has required of me prayer and almsgiving so long as I live
and piety towards my mother, and has not made me a miserable tyrant
and peace upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised up alive
That is, Jesus the son of Mary, - by the word of truth whereon ye do dispute
God could not take to himself any son! celebrated be His praise! when He decrees a matter He only says to it, 'BE,' and it is
and, verily, God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him; this is the right way
And the parties have disagreed amongst themselves, but woe to those who disbelieve, from the witnessing of the mighty day
they can hear and they can see, on the day when they shall come to us; but the evildoers are today in obvious error
And warn them of the day of sighing, when the matter is decreed while they are heedless, and while they do not believe
Verily, we will inherit the earth and all who are upon it, and unto us shall they return
And mention, in the Book, Abraham; verily, he was a confessors,- a prophet
When he said to his father, 'O my sire! why dost thou worship what can neither hear nor see nor avail thee aught
O my sire! verily, to me has come knowledge which has not come to thee; then follow me, and I will guide thee to a level way
O my sire! serve not Satan; verily, Satan is ever a rebel against the Merciful
O my sire! verily,. I fear that there may touch thee torment from the Merciful, and that thou mayest be a client of Satan
Said he, 'What! art thou averse from my gods, O Abraham? verily, if thou dost not desist I will certainly stone thee; but get thee gone from me for a time
Said he, 'Peace be upon thee! I will ask forgiveness for thee from my Lord; verily, He is very gracious to me
but I will part from you and what ye call on beside God, and will pray my Lord that I be not unfortunate in my prayer to my Lord
And when he had parted from them and what they served beside God, we granted him Isaac and Jacob, and each of them we made a prophet

and he used to bid his people prayers and almsgiving, and was acceptable in the sight of his Lord

and we raised him to a lofty place
These are those to whom God has been gracious, of the prophets of the seed of Adam, and of those whom we bore with Noah, and of the seed of Abraham and Israel, and of those we guided and elected; when the signs of the Merciful are read to them, they fall down adoring and weeping
And successors succeeded them, who lost sight of prayer and followed lusts, but they shall at length find themselves going wrong
except such as repent and believe and act aright; for these shall enter Paradise, and shall not be wronged at all
gardens of Eden, which the Merciful has promised to His servants in the unseen; verily, His promise ever comes to pass
They shall hear no empty talk therein, but only 'peace;' and they shall have their provision therein, morning and evening
that is Paradise which we will give for an inheritance to those of our servants who are pious
We do not descend save at the bidding of thy Lord; His is what is before us, and what is behind us, and what is between those; for thy Lord is never forgetful
the Lord of the heavens and the earth, and of what is between the two; then serve Him and persevere in His service. Dost thou know a namesake of His
Man will say, 'What! when I have died shall I then come forth alive
Does not man then remember that we created him before when he was naught
And by thy Lord! we will surely gather them together, and the devils too; then we will surely bring them forward around hell, on their knees
Then we will drag off from every sect whichever of them has been most bold against the Merciful

Then we will save those who fear us; but we will leave the evildoers therein on their knees

And how many generations before them have we destroyed who were better off in property and appearance
Say, 'Whosoever is in error, let the Merciful extend to him length of days!- until they see what they are threatened with, whether it be the torment or whether it be the Hour, then they shall know who is worse placed and weakest in forces
And those who are guided God will increase in guidance. And enduring good works are best with thy Lord for a reward, and best for restoration
Hast thou seen him who disbelieves in our signs, and says, 'I shall surely be given wealth and children
Has he become acquainted with the unseen, or has he taken a compact with the Merciful
Not so! We will write down what he says, and we will extend to him a length of torment
and we will make him inherit what he says, and he shall come to us alone
They take other gods besides God to be their glory
Not so! They shall deny their worship and shall be opponents of theirs
Dost thou not see that we have sent the devils against the misbelievers, to drive them on to sin
but, be not thou hasty with them. Verily, we will number them a number (of days)
the day when we will gather the pious to the Merciful as ambassadors
and we will drive the sinners to hell like (herds) to water
They shall not possess intercession, save he who has taken a compact with the Merciful
They say, 'The Merciful has taken to Himself a son
ye have brought a monstrous thing
The heavens well-nigh burst asunder thereat, and the earth is riven, and the mountains fall down broken
that they attribute to the Merciful a son
but it, becomes not the Merciful to take to Himself a son
there is none in the heavens or the earth but comes to the Merciful as a servant
He counts them and numbers them by number
and they are all coming to Him on the resurrection day singly
Verily, those who believe and act aright, to them the Merciful will give love

H
We have not sent down this Qur'an to thee that thou shouldst be wretched
only as a reminder to him who fears
descending from Him who created the earth and the high heavens
the Merciful settled on the throne
His are what is in the heavens, and what is in the earth, and what is between the two, and what is beneath the ground

God, there is no god but He! His are the excellent names

And when he came to it he was called to, 'O Moses
verily, I am thy Lord, so take off thy sandals; verily, thou art in the holy valley Tuva
and I have chosen thee. So listen to what is inspired thee

and join him with me in the affair
that we may celebrate Thy praises much
and remember Thee much
Verily, Thou dost ever behold us
He said, 'Thou art granted thy request, O Moses
and we have already shown favours unto thee at another time
When we inspired thy mother with what we inspired her
Hurl him into the ark, and hurl him into the sea; and the sea shall cast him on the shore, and an enemy of mine and of his shall take him;" - for on thee have I cast my love, that thou mayest be formed under my eye
When thy sister walked on and said, "Shall I guide you to one who will take charge of him?" And we restored thee to thy mother, that her eye might be cheered and that she should not grieve. And thou didst slay a person and we saved thee from the trouble, and we tried thee with various trials. And thou didst tarry for years amongst the people of Midian; then thou didst come (hither) at (our) decree, O Moses
And I have chosen thee for myself
Go, thou and thy brother, with my signs, and be not remiss in remembering me
Go ye both to Pharaoh; verily, he is outrageous

We did show him our signs, all of them, but he called them lies and did refuse
Said he, 'Hast thou come to us, to turn us out of our land with thy magic, O Moses
Then we will bring you magic like it; and we will make between us and thee an appointment; we will not break it, nor do thou either;-a fair place
Said he, 'Let your appointment be for the day of adornment, and let the people assemble in the forenoon
But Pharaoh turned his back, and collected his tricks, and then he came
Said Moses to them, 'Woe to you! do not forge against God a lie; lest He destroy you by torment; for disappointed has ever been he who has forged

Said they, 'These twain are certainly two magicians, who wish to turn you out of your land by their magic, and to remove your most exemplary doctrine
Collect therefore your tricks, and then form a row; for he is prosperous today who has the upper hand
Said they, 'O Moses! either thou must throw, or we must be the first to throw
He said, 'Nay, throw ye!' and lo! their ropes and their staves appeared to move along
And Moses felt a secret fear within his soul
Said we, 'Fear not! thou shalt have the upper hand
Throw down what is in thy right hand; and it shall devour what they have made. Verily, what they have made is but a magician's trick; and no magician shall prosper wherever he comes
And the magicians were cast down in adoration; said they, 'We believe in the Lord of Aaron and of Moses
Said he, 'Do ye believe in Him before I give you leave? Verily, he is your master who taught you magic! Therefore will I surely cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides, and I will surely crucify you on the trunks of palm trees; and ye shall surely know which of us is keenest at torment and more lasting
Said they, 'We will never prefer thee to what has come to us of manifest signs, and to Him who originated us. Decide then what thou canst decide; thou canst only decide in the life of this world
Verily, we believe in our Lord, that He may pardon us our sins, and the magic thou hast forced us to use; and God is better and more lasting
Verily, he who comes to his Lord a sinner,- verily, for him is hell; he shall not die therein, and shall not live

gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; for that is the reward of him who keeps pure
And we inspired Moses, 'Journey by night with my servants, and strike out for them a dry road in the sea. Fear not pursuit, nor be afraid
Then Pharaoh followed them with his armies, and there overwhelmed them of the sea that which overwhelmed them
And Pharaoh and his people went astray and were not guided
O children of Israel! We have saved you from your enemy; and we made an appointment with you on the right side of the mount; and we sent down upon you the manna and the quails

Yet am I forgiving unto him who repents and believes and does right, and then is guided
But what has hastened thee on away from thy people, O Moses
He said, 'They were here upon my track and I hastened on to Thee, my Lord! that thou mightest be pleased
Said He, 'Verily, we have tried thy people, since thou didst leave, and es Samariy has led them astray
And Moses returned to his people, wrathful, grieving! Said he, 'O my, people! did not your Lord promise you a good promise? Has the time seemed too long for you, or do you desire that wrath should light on you from your Lord, that ye have broken your promise to me
They said, 'We have not broken our promise to thee of our own accord. But we were made to carry loads of the ornaments of the people, and we hurled them down, and so did es Samariy cast
and he brought forth for the people a corporeal calf which lowed.' And they said, 'This is your god and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten
What! do they not see that it does not return them any speech, and cannot control for them harm or profit
Aaron too told them before, 'O my people! ye are only being tried thereby; and, verily, your Lord is the Merciful, so follow me and obey my bidding
They said, 'We will not cease to pay devotion to it until Moses come back to us
Said he, 'O Aaron! what prevented thee, when thou didst see them go astray
from following me? Hast thou then rebelled against my bidding
Said he, 'O son of my mother! seize me not by my beard, or my head! Verily, I feared lest thou shouldst say, "Thou hast made a division amongst the children of Israel, and hast not observed my word
Said he, 'What was thy design, O Samariy
Said he, 'I beheld what they beheld not, and I grasped a handful from the footprint of the messenger and cast it; for thus my soul induced me
Said he, 'Then get thee gone; verily, it shall be thine in life to say, "Touch me not!" and, verily, for thee there is a threat which thou shalt surely never alter. But look at thy god to which thou wert just now devout; we will surely burn it, and then we will scatter it in scattered pieces in the sea
Your God is only God who,- there is no god but He,- He embraceth everything in His knowledge
Thus do we narrate to thee the history of what has gone before, and we have brought thee a reminder from us
Whoso turns therefrom, verily, he shall bear on the resurrection day a burden
for them to bear for aye, and evil for them on the resurrection day will it be to bear
On the day when the trumpet shall be blown, and we will gather the sinners in that day blue-eyed
They shall whisper to each other, 'Ye have only tarried ten days
We know best what they say, when the most exemplary of them in his way shall say, 'Ye have only tarried a day
They will ask thee about the mountains; say, 'My Lord will scatter them in scattered pieces
and He will leave them a level plain
thou wilt see therein no crookedness or inequality
On that day they shall follow the caller in whom is no crookedness; and the voices shall be hushed before the Merciful, and thou shalt hear naught but a shuffling
On that day shall no intercession be of any avail, save from such as the Merciful permits, and who is acceptable to Him in speech
He knows what is before them and what is behind them, but they do not comprehend knowledge of Him
Faces shall be humbled before the Living, the Self-subsistent; and he who bears injustice is ever lost
But he who does righteous acts and is a believer, he shall fear neither wrong nor diminution
Thus have we sent it down an Arabic Qur'an; and we have turned about in it the threat,- haply they may fear, or it may cause them to remember
Exalted then be God, the king, the truth! Hasten not the Qur'an before its inspiration is decided for thee; but say, 'O Lord! increase me in knowledge
We did make a covenant with Adam of yore, but he forgot it, and we found no firm purpose in him
And when we said to the angels, ' Adore Adam,' they adored, save Iblis, who refused
And we said, 'O Adam! verily, this is a foe to thee and to thy wife; never then let him drive you twain forth from the garden or thou wilt be wretched
Verily, thou hast not to be hungry there, nor naked
and, verily, thou shalt not thirst therein, nor feel the noonday heat
But the devil whispered to him. Said he, 'O Adam! shall I guide thee to the tree of immortality, and a kingdom that shall not wane
And they eat therefrom, and their shame became apparent to them; and they began to stitch upon themselves some leaves of the garden; and Adam rebelled against his Lord, and went astray
Then his Lord chose him, and relented towards him, and guided him
Said he, 'Go down, ye twain, therefrom altogether, some of you foes to the other. And if there should come to you, from me a guidance; then whoso follows my guidance shall neither err nor be wretched
But he who turns away from my reminder, verily, for him shall be a straitened livelihood; and we will gather him on the resurrection day blind
He shall say, 'My Lord! wherefore hast Thou gathered me blind when I used to see
He shall say, 'Our signs came to thee, and thou didst forget them; thus today art thou forgotten
Thus do we recompense him who is extravagant and believes not in the signs of his Lord; and the torment of the hereafter is keener and more lasting
Does it not occur to them how many generations we have destroyed before them?- they walk in their very dwelling-places; verily, in that are signs to those endued with intelligence
And had it not been for thy Lord's word already passed (the punishment) would have been inevitable and (at) an appointed time
Bear patiently then what they say, and celebrate the praises of thy Lord before the rising of the sun, and before its setting, and at times in the night celebrate them; and at the ends of the day; haply thou mayest please (Him)
And do not strain after what we have provided a few of them with - the flourish of the life of this world, to try them by; but the provision of thy Lord is better and more lasting
Bid thy people prayer, and persevere in it; we do not ask thee to provide. We will provide, and the issue shall be to piety
They say, 'Unless he bring us a sign from his Lord - What! has there not come to them the manifest sign of what was in the pages of yore
But had we destroyed them with torment before it, they would have said, 'Unless Thou hadst sent to us an apostle, that we might follow Thy signs before we were abased and put to shame
Say, ' Each one has to wait, so wait ye but in the end ye shall know who are the fellows of the level way, and who are guided
Their reckoning draws nigh to men, yet in heedlessness they turn aside
No reminder comes to them from their Lord of late, but they listen while they mock
and their hearts make sport thereof! And those who do wrong discourse secretly (saying), 'Is this man aught but a mortal like yourselves? will ye accede to magic, while ye can see
Say, 'My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and the earth, He hears and knows
Nay!' they say, 'a jumble of dreams; nay! he has forged it; nay! he is a poet; but let him bring us a sign as those of yore were sent
No city before them which we destroyed believed - how will they believe
Nor did we send before them any but men whom we inspired? Ask ye the people of the Scriptures if ye do not know
Nor did we make them bodies not to eat food, nor were they immortal
Yet we made our promise to them good, and we saved them and whom we pleased; but we destroyed those who committed excesses
We have sent down to you a book in which is a reminder for you; have ye then no sense
How many a city which had done wrong have we broken up, and raised up after it another people
And when they perceived our violence they ran away from it
Run not away, but return to what ye delighted in, and to your dwellings! haply ye will be questioned
Said they, 'O woe is us! verily, we were wrong-doers
And that ceased not to be their cry until we made them mown down,- smouldering out
We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between the two in play
Had we wished to take to a sport, we would have taken to one from before ourselves; had we been bent on doing so
Nay, we hurl the truth against falsehood and it crashes into it, and lo! it vanishes, but woe to you for what ye attribute (to God)
His are whosoever are in the heavens and the earth, and those who are with Him are not too big with pride for His service, nor do they weary
They celebrate His praises by night and day without intermission
Or have they taken gods from the earth who can raise up (the dead)
Were there in both (heaven and earth) gods beside God, both would surely have been corrupted. Celebrated then be the praise of God, the Lord of the throne, above what they ascribe
He shall not be questioned concerning what He does, but they shall be questioned
Have they taken gods beside Him? Say, 'Bring your proofs. This is the reminder of those who are with me, and of those who were before me.' Nay, most of them know not the truth, and they do turn aside
We have not sent any prophet before thee, but we inspired him that, 'There is no god but Me, so serve ye Me
And they say, 'The Merciful has taken a son; celebrated be His praise!' - Nay, honoured servants
they do not speak until He speaks; but at His bidding do they act
He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they shall not intercede except for him whom He is pleased with; and they shrink through fear
And whoso of them should say, 'Verily, I am god instead of Him,' such a one we recompense with hell; thus do we recompense the wrongdoers
Do not those who misbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were both solid, and we burst them asunder; and we made from water every living thing - will they then not believe
And we placed on the earth firm mountains lest it should move with them, and He made therein open roads for paths, haply they may be guided
and we made the heaven a guarded roof; yet from our signs they turn aside
He it is who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, each floating in a sky
We never made for any mortal before thee immortality; what, if thou shouldst die, will they live on for aye
Every soul shall taste of death! we will test them with evil and with good, as a trial; and unto us shall they return
And when those who misbelieve see thee, they only take thee for a jest, 'Is this he who mentions your gods?' Yet they at the mention of the Merciful do disbelieve
Man is created out of haste. I will show, you my signs; but do not hurry Me
And they say, 'When will this threat (come to pass), if ye tell the truth
Did those who misbelieve but know when the fire shall not be warded off from their faces nor from their backs, and they shall not be helped
Nay, it shall come on them suddenly, and shall dumbfounder them, and they shall not be able to repel it, nor shall they be respited
Prophets before thee have been mocked at, but that whereat they jested encompassed those who mocked
Say, 'Who shall guard you by night and by day from the Merciful?' Nay, but they from the mention of their Lord do turn aside
Have they gods to defend them against us? These cannot help themselves, nor shall they be abetted against us
Nay, but we have granted enjoyment to these men and to their fathers whilst life was prolonged. Do they not see that we come to the land and shorten its borders? Shall they then prevail
Say, 'I only warn you by inspiration;' but the deaf hear not the call when they are warned
But if a blast of the torment of thy Lord touches them, they will surely say, 'O, woe is us! verily, we were wrong-doers
We will place just balances upon the resurrection day, and no soul shall be wronged at all, even though it be the weight of a grain of mustard seed, we will bring it; for we are good enough at reckoning up
We did give to Moses and Aaron the Discrimination, and a light and a reminder to those who fear
who are afraid of their Lord in secret; and who at the Hour do shrink
This is a blessed reminder which we have sent down, will ye then deny it
And we gave Abraham a right direction before; for about him we knew
When he said to his father and to his people, 'What are these images to which ye pay devotion
Said they, 'We found our fathers serving them
Said he, 'Both you and your fathers have been in obvious error
They said, 'Dost thou come to us with the truth, or art thou but of those who play
He said, 'Nay, but your Lord is Lord of the heavens and the earth, which He originated; and I am of those who testify to this
and, by God! I will plot against your idols after ye have turned and shown me your backs
So he brake them all in pieces, except a large one they had; that haply they might refer it to that
Said they, 'Who has done this with our gods? verily, he is of the wrong-doers
They said, 'We heard a youth mention them who is called Abraham
Said they, 'Then bring him before the eyes of men; haply they will bear witness
Said they, 'Was it thou who did this to our gods, O Abraham
Said he, 'Nay, it was this largest of them; but ask them, if they can speak
Then they came to themselves and said, 'Verily, ye are the wrong-doers
Then they turned upside down again: 'Thou knewest that these cannot speak
Said he, 'Will ye then serve, beside God, what cannot profit you at all, nor harm you
fie upon you, and what ye serve beside God! have ye then no sense
Said they, 'Burn him, and help your gods, if ye are going to do so
We said, 'O fire! be thou cool and a safety for Abraham
They desired to plot against him, but we made them the losers
And we brought him and Lot safely to the land which we have blessed for the world
and we bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob as a fresh gift, and each of them we made righteous persons
and we made them high priests to guide (men) by our bidding, and we inspired them to do good works, and to be steadfast in prayer, and to give alms; and they did serve us
And Lot, to him we gave judgment and knowledge, and we brought him safely out of the city which had done vile acts; verily, they were a people who wrought abominations
And we made him enter into our mercy; verily, he was of the righteous
And Noah, when he cried aforetime, and we answered him and saved him and his people from the mighty trouble
and we helped him against the people who said our signs were lies; verily, they were a bad people, so we drowned them all together
And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field, when some people's sheep had strayed therein at night; and we testified to their judgment
and this we gave Solomon to understand. To each of them we gave judgment and knowledge; and to David we subjected the mountains to celebrate our praises, and the birds too,- it was we who did it
And we taught him the art of making coats of mail for you, to shield you from each other's violence; are ye then grateful
And to Solomon (we subjected) the wind blowing stormily, to run on at his bidding to the land which Ave have blessed, - for all things did we know
and some devils to dive for him, and to do other works beside that; and we kept guard over them
And Job, when he cried to his Lord, 'As for me, harm has touched me, but Thou art the most merciful of the merciful ones
And we answered him, and removed from him the distress that was upon him; and we gave his family, and the like of them with them, as a mercy from us, and a remembrance to those who serve us
And Ishmael, and Idris, and Dhu 'l Kifl, all of these were of the patient
and we made them enter into our mercy; verily, they were among the righteous
And Dhu 'nnun, when he went away in wrath and thought that we had no power over him; and he cried out in the darkness, ' There is no god but Thou, celebrated be Thy praise! Verily, I was of the evildoers
And we answered him, and saved him from the trouble. Thus do we save believers
And Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord, 'O Lord! leave me not alone; for thou art the best of heirs
And we answered him, and bestowed upon him John; and we made his wife right for him; verily, these vied in good works, and called on us with longing and dread, and were humble before us
And she who guarded her private parts, and we breathed into her of our Spirit, and we made her and her son a sign unto the worlds
Verily, this your nation is one nation; and I am your Lord, so serve me
But they cut up their affair amongst themselves; they all shall return to us
and he who acts aright, and he who is a believer, there is no denial of his efforts, for, verily, we will write them down for him
There is a ban upon a city which we have destroyed that they shall not return
until Yagug and Magug are let out, and they from every hummock shall glide forth
And the true promise draws nigh, and lo! they are staring - the eyes of those who misbelieve! O, woe is us! we were heedless of this, nay, we were wrong-doers
Verily, ye, and what ye serve beside God, shall be the pebbles of hell, to it shall ye go down
Had these been God's they would not have gone down thereto: but all shall dwell therein for aye
for them therein is groaning, but they therein shall not be heard
Verily, those for whom the good (reward) from us was fore-ordained, they from it shall be kept far away
they shall not hear the slightest sound thereof, and they in what their souls desire shall dwell for aye
The greatest terror shall not grieve them; and the angels shall meet them, (saying), 'This is your day which ye were promised
The day when we will roll up the heavens as es-Sigill rolls up the books; as we produced it at its first creation will we bring it back again - a promise binding upon us; verily, we are going to do it
And already have we written in the Psalms after the reminder that the earth shall my righteous servants inherit
Verily, in this is preaching for a people who serve me
We have only sent thee as a mercy to the worlds
Say, 'I am only inspired that your God is one God; are ye then resigned
But if they turn their backs say, 'I have proclaimed (war) against all alike, but I know not if what ye are threatened with be near or far
Verily, He knows what is spoken openly, and He knows what ye hide
I know not, haply, it is a trial for you and a provision for a season
Say, 'My Lord! judge thou with truth! and our Lord is the Merciful whom we ask for aid against what they ascribe
O ye folk! fear your Lord. Verily, the earthquake of the Hour is a mighty thing
On the day ye shall see it, every suckling woman shall be seared away from that to which she gave suck; and every pregnant woman shall lay down her load; and thou shalt see men drunken, though they be not drunken: but the torment of God is severe
And amongst men is one who wrangles about God without knowledge, and follows every rebellious devil
against whom it is written down that whoso takes him for a patron, verily, he will lead him astray, and will guide him towards the torment of the blaze
O ye folk! if ye are in doubt about the raising (of the dead),- verily, we created you from earth, then from a clot, then from congealed blood, then from a morsel, shaped or shapeless, that we may explain to you. And we make what we please rest in the womb until an appointed time; then we bring you forth babes; then let you reach your full age; and of you are some who die; and of you are some who are kept back till the most decrepit age, till he knows no longer aught of knowledge. And ye see the earth parched, and when we send down water on it, it stirs and swells, and brings forth herbs of every beauteous kind
That is because God, He is the truth, and because He quickens the dead, and because He is mighty over all
and because the Hour is coming, there is no doubt therein, and because God raises up those who are in the tombs
And amongst men is one who wrangles about God without knowledge or guidance or an illuminating book
twisting his neck from the way of God; for him is disgrace in this world, and we will make him taste, upon the resurrection day, the torment of burning
That is for what thy hands have done before, and for that God is not unjust unto His servants
And amongst men is one who serves God (wavering) on a brink; and if there befall him good, he is comforted; but if there befall him a trial, he turns round again, and loses this world and the next - that is an obvious loss
He calls, besides God, on what can neither harm him nor profit him;- that is a wide error
He calls on him whose harm is nigher than his profit,- a bad lord and a bad comrade
Verily, God makes those who believe and do aright enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow; verily, God does what He will
He who thinks that God will never help him in this world or the next - let him stretch a cord to the roof and put an end to himself; and let him cut it and see if his stratagem will remove what he is enraged at
Thus have we sent down manifest signs; for, verily, God guides whom He will
Verily, those who believe, and those who are Jews, and the Sabaeans, and the Christians, and the Magians, and those who join other gods with God, verily, God will decide between them on the resurrection day; verily, God is witness over all
Do they not see that God, whosoever is in the heavens adores Him, and whosoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the beasts, and many among men, though many a one deserves the torments? Whomsoever God abases there is none to honour him; verily, God does what He pleases
These are two disputants who dispute about their Lord, but those who misbelieve, for them are cut out garments of fire, there shall be poured over their heads boiling water
wherewith what is in their bellies shall be dissolved and their skins too
and for them are maces of iron
Whenever they desire to come forth therefrom through pain, they are sent back into it:. 'And taste ye the torment of the burning

Verily, those who misbelieve and who turn men away from God's path and the Sacred Mosque, which we have made for all men alike, the dweller therein, and the stranger, and he who desires therein profanation with injustice, we will make him taste grievous woe
And when we established for Abraham the place of the House, (saying), 'Associate naught with me, but cleanse my House for those who make the circuits, for those who stand to pray, for those who bow, and for those too who adore
And proclaim amongst men the Pilgrimage; let them come to you on foot and on every slim camel, from every deep pass
that they may witness advantages for them, and may mention the name of God for the stated days over what God has provided them with of brute beasts, then eat thereof and feed the badly off, the poor
Then let them finish the neglect of their persons, and let them pay their vows and make the circuit round the old House
That do. And whoso magnifies the sacred things of God it is better for him with his Lord. 'Cattle are lawful for you, except what is recited to you; and avoid the abomination of idols, and avoid speaking falsely
being 'Hanifs to God, not associating aught with Him; for he who associates aught with God, it is as though he had fallen from heaven, and the birds snatch him up, or the wind blows him away into a far distant place
That - and he who makes grand the symbols of God, they come from piety of heart
Therein have ye advantages for an appointed time, then the place for sacrificing them is at the old House
To every nation have we appointed rites, to mention the name of God over what He has provided them with of brute beasts; and your God is one God, to Him then be resigned, and give glad tidings to the lowly
whose hearts when God is mentioned are afraid, and to those who are patient of what befalls them, and to those who are steadfast in prayer and of what we have given them expend in alms
The bulky (camels) we have made for you one of the symbols of God, therein have ye good; so mention the name of God over them as they stand in a row, and when they fall down (dead) eat of them, and feed the easily contented and him who begs
Thus have we subjected them to you; haply, ye may give thanks! Their meat will never reach to God, nor yet their blood, but the piety from you will reach to Him. Thus hath He subjected them to you that ye may magnify God for guiding you: and give thou glad tidiness to those who do good
Verily, God will defend those who believe; verily, God loves not any misbelieving traitor
Permission is given to those who fight because they have been wronged, - and, verily, God to help them has the might
who have been driven forth from their homes undeservedly, only for that they said, 'Our Lord is God;' and were it not for God's repelling some men with others, cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques, wherein God's name is mentioned much, would be destroyed. But God will surely help him who helps Him; verily, God is powerful, mighty
Who, if we establish them in the earth, are steadfast in prayer, and give alms, and bid what is right, and forbid what is wrong; and God's is the future of affairs
But if they call thee liar, the people of Noah called him liar before them, as did 'Ad and Thamud
and the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot
and the fellows of Midian; and Moses was called a liar too: but I let the misbelievers range at large, and then I seized on them, and how great was the change
And how many a city have we destroyed while it yet did wrong, and it was turned over on its roofs, and (how many) a deserted well and lofty palace
Have they not travelled on through the land? and have they not hearts to understand with, or ears to hear with? for it is not their eyes which are blind, but blind are the hearts which are within their breasts
They will bid thee hasten on the torment, but God will never fail in his promise; for, verily, a day with thy Lord is as a thousand years of what ye number
And to how many a city have I given full range while it yet did wrong! then I seized on it, and unto me was the return
Say, 'O ye folk! I am naught but a plain warner to you
but those who believe and do right, for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
but those who strive to discredit our signs, they are the fellows of hell
We have not sent before thee any apostle or prophet, but that when he wished, Satan threw not something into his wish; but God annuls what Satan throws; then does God confirm his signs, and God is knowing, wise
to make what Satan throws a trial unto those in whose hearts is sickness, and those whose hearts are hard; and, verily, the wrong - doers are in a wide schism
and that those who have been given 'the knowledge' may know that it is the truth from thy Lord, and may believe therein, and that their hearts may be lowly; for, verily, God surely will guide those who believe into a right way
But those who misbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the Hour comes on them suddenly, or there comes on them the torment of the barren day
The kingdom on that day shall be God's, He shall judge between them; and those who believe and do aright shall be in gardens of pleasure
but those who misbelieve and say our signs are lies, these - for them is shameful woe
And those who flee in God's way, and then are slain or die, God will provide them with a goodly provision; for, verily, God is the best of providers
He shall surely make them enter by an entrance that they like; for, verily, God is knowing, clement
That (is so). Whoever punishes with the like of what he has been injured with, and shall then be outraged again, God shall surely help him; verily, God pardons, forgives
That for that God joins on the night to the day, and joins on the day to the night, and that God is hearing, seeing
that is for that God is the truth, and for that what ye call on beside Him is falsehood, and that God is the high, the great
Hast thou not seen that God sends down from the sky water, and on the morrow the earth is green? verily, God is kind and well aware
His is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and, verily, God is rich and to be praised
Hast thou not seen that God has subjected for you what is in the earth, and the ship that runs on in the sea at His bidding, and He holds back the sky from falling on the earth save at His bidding? verily, God to men is gracious, merciful
He it is who quickens you, then makes you die, then will He quicken you again - verily, man is indeed ungrateful
For every nation have we made rites which they observe; let them not then dispute about the matter, but call upon thy Lord; verily, thou art surely in a right guidance
But if they wrangle with thee, say, 'God best knows what ye do
God shall judge between them on the resurrection day concerning that whereon they disagreed
Didst thou not know that God knows what is in the heavens and the earth? verily, that is in a book; verily, that for God is easy
And they serve beside God what He has sent down no power for, and what they have no knowledge of; but the wrong-doers shall have none to help them
When our signs are read to them manifest, thou mayest recognise in the faces of those who misbelieve disdain; they well-nigh rush at those who recite to them our signs. Say, 'Shall I inform you of something worse than that for you, the Fire which God has promised to those who misbelieve? an evil journey shall it be
O ye folk! a parable is struck out for you, so listen to it. Verily, those on whom ye call beside God could never create a fly if they all united together to do it, and if the fly should despoil them of aught they could not snatch it away from it - weak is both the seeker and the sought
They do not value God at His true value; verily, God is powerful, mighty
God chooses apostles of the angels and of men; verily, God hears and sees
He knows what is before them and what is behind them; and unto God affairs return
O ye who believe! bow down and adore, and serve your Lord, and do well, haply ye may prosper
and fight strenuously for God, as is His due. He has elected you, and has not put upon you any hindrance by your religion,- the faith of your father Abraham. He has named you Muslims before and in this (book), that the Apostle may be a witness against you, and that ye may be witnesses against men. Be ye then steadfast in prayer, and give alms, and hold fast by God; He is your sovereign, and an excellent sovereign, and an excellent help
Prosperous are the believers
who in their prayers are humble
and who from vain talk turn aside
and who in almsgiving are active
And who guard their private parts
except for their wives or what their right hands possess for then, verily, they are not to be blamed
but whoso craves aught beyond that, they are the transgressors
and who observe their trusts and covenants
and who guard well their prayers
these are the heirs
who shall inherit Paradise; they shall dwell therein for aye
We have created man from an extract of clay
then we made him a clot in a sure depository
then we created the clot congealed blood, and we created the congealed blood a morsel; then we created the morsel bone, and we clothed the bone with flesh then we produced it another creation; and blessed be God, the best of creators
Then shall ye after that surely die
then shall ye on the day of resurrection be raised
And we have created above you seven roads; nor are we heedless of the creation
And we send down from the heaven water by measure, and we make it rest in the earth; but, verily, we are able to take it away
and we produce for you thereby gardens of palms and grapes wherein ye have many fruits, and whence ye eat
And a tree growing out of Mount Sinai which produces oil, and a condiment for those who eat

and on them and on ships ye are borne

Said the chiefs of those who misbelieved among his people, 'This is nothing but a mortal like yourselves who wishes to have preference over you, and had God pleased He would have sent angels; we have not heard of this amongst our fathers of yore
he is nothing but a man possessed; let him bide then for a season
Said he, 'Help me, for they call me liar

But when thou art settled, thou and those with thee in the ark, say, "Praise belongs to God, who saved us from the unjust people
And say, "My Lord! make me to alight in a blessed alighting-place, for Thou art the best of those who cause men to alight
Verily, in that is a sign, and, verily, we were trying them
Then we raised up after them another generation
and we sent amongst them a prophet of themselves (saying), 'Serve God, ye have no god but He; will ye then not fear
Said the chiefs of his people who misbelieved, and called the meeting of the last day a lie, and to whom we gave enjoyment in the life of this world, 'This is only a mortal like yourselves, who eats of what ye eat
and drinks of what ye drink; and if ye obey a mortal like yourselves, verily, ye will then be surely losers
Does he promise you that when ye are dead, and have become dust and bones, that then ye will be brought forth
Away, away with what ye are threatened
there is only our life in the world! We die and we live, and we shall not be raised
He is only a man who forges against God a lie. And we believe not in him
Said he, 'My Lord! help me, for they call me liar
He said, 'Within a little they will surely awake repenting
And the noise seized them deservedly; and we made them as rubbish borne by a torrent; so, away with the unjust people
Then we raised up after them other generations
No nation can anticipate its appointed time, nor keep it back
Then we sent our apostles one after another. Whenever its apostle came to any nation they called him a liar; and we made some to follow others; and we made them legends; away then with a people who do not believe
Then we sent Moses and his brother Aaron with our signs
and with plain authority to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they were too big with pride, and were a haughty people
And they said, 'Shall we believe two mortals like ourselves, when their people are servants of ours
So they called them liars, and were of those who perished
And we gave Moses the Book, that haply they might be guided
And we made the son of Mary and his mother a sign; and we lodged them both on a high place, furnished with security and a spring
O ye apostles! eat of the good things and do right; verily, what ye do I know
And, verily, this nation of yours is one nation, and I am your Lord; so fear me
And they have become divided as to their affair amongst themselves into sects, each party rejoicing in what they have themselves
So leave them in their flood (of error) for a time
Do they reckon that that of which we grant them such an extent
of wealth and children, we hasten to them as good things - nay, but they do not perceive
Verily, those who shrink with terror at their Lord
and those who in the signs of their Lord believe
and those who with their Lord join none
and those who give what they do give while their hearts are afraid that they unto their Lord will return
these hasten to good things and are first to gain the same
But we will not oblige a soul beyond its capacity; for with us is a book that utters the truth, and they shall not be wronged
Nay, their hearts are in a flood (of error) at this, and they have works beside this which they do
Until we catch the affluent ones amongst them with the torment; then lo! they cry for aid
Cry not for aid today! verily, against us ye will not be helped
My signs were recited to you, but upon your heels did ye turn back
big with pride at it, in vain discourse by night
Is it that they did not ponder over the words, whether that has come to them which came not to their fathers of yore
Or did they not know their apostle, that they thus deny him
Or do they say, 'He is possessed by a ginn?' Nay, he came to them with the truth, and most of them are averse from the truth
But if the truth were to follow their lusts, the heavens and the earth would be corrupted with all who in them are! - Nay, we brought them their reminder, but they from their reminder turn aside
Or dost thou ask them for a tribute? but the tribute of thy Lord is better, for He is the best of those who provide
And, verily, thou dost call them to a right way
but, verily, those who believe not in the hereafter from the way do veer
But if we had mercy on them, and removed the distress they have, they would persist in their rebellion, blindly wandering on
And we caught them with the torment, but they did not abase themselves before their Lord, nor did they humble themselves
until we opened for them a door with grievous torment, then lo! they are in despair
He it is who produced for you hearing, and sight, and minds, - little is it that ye thank
And He it is who created you in the earth, and unto Him shall ye be gathered
And He it is who gives you life and death; and His is the alternation of the night and the day; have ye then no sense
Nay, but they said like that which those of yore did say
They said, 'What! when we have become earth and bones, are we then going to be raised
We have been promised this, and our fathers too, before;- this is naught but old folks' tales
Say, 'Whose is the earth and those who are therein, if ye but know
They will say, 'God's.' Say, 'Do ye not then mind
Say, 'Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the mighty throne
They will say, 'God.' Say, 'Do ye not then fear
Say, 'In whose hand is the dominion of everything; He succours but is not succoured, - if ye did but know
They will say, 'God's.' Say, 'Then how can ye be so infatuated
Nay, we have brought them the truth, but, verily, they are liars
God never took a son, nor was there ever any god with Him;- then each god would have gone off with what he had created, and some would have exalted themselves over others,- celebrated be His praises above what they attribute (to Him)
He who knows the unseen and the visible, exalted be He above what they join with Him
Say, 'My Lord! if Thou shouldst show me what they are threatened
my Lord! then place me not amongst the unjust people
Missing
Repel evil by what is better. We know best what they attribute (to thee)
And say, 'My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from the incitings of the devils
and I seek refuge in Thee from their presence
Until when death comes to any one of them he says, 'My Lord! send ye me back
haply I may do right in that which I have left!' Not so! - a mere word he speaks! - but behind them is a bar until the day they shall be raised
And when, the trumpet shall be blown, and there shall be no relation between them on that day, nor shall they beg of each other then
And he whose scales are heavy,- they are the prosperous
But he whose scales are light,- these are they who lose themselves, in hell to dwell for aye
The fire shall scorch their faces, and they shall curl their lips therein
Were not my signs recited to you? and ye said that they were lies
They say, 'Our Lord! our misery overcame us, and we were a people who did err
Our Lord! take us out therefrom, and if we return, then shall we be unjust
He will say, 'Go ye away into it and speak not to me
Verily, there was a sect of my servants who said, Our Lord! we believe, so pardon us, and have mercy upon us, for Thou art the best of the merciful ones
And ye took them for a jest until ye forgat my reminder and did laugh thereat
Verily, I have recompensed them this day for their patience; verily, they are happy now
He will say, 'How long a number of years did ye tarry on earth
They will say, 'We tarried a day or part of a day, but ask the Numberers
He will say, 'Ye have only tarried a little, were ye but to know it
Did ye then reckon that we created you for sport, and that to us ye would not return
But exalted be God, the true; there is no god but He, the Lord of the noble throne
and whoso calls upon another god with God has no proof of it, but, verily, his account is with his Lord; verily, the misbelievers shall not prosper
And say, 'Lord, pardon and be merciful, for Thou art the best of the merciful ones
A chapter which we have sent down and determined, and have sent down therein manifest signs; haply ye may be mindful
The whore and the whoremonger. Scourge each of them with a hundred stripes, and do not let pity for them take hold of you in God's religion, if ye believe in God and the last day; and let a party of the believers witness their torment
And the whoremonger shall marry none but a whore or an idolatress; and the whore shall none marry but an adulterer or an idolater; God has prohibited this to the believers
but those who cast (imputations) on chaste women and then do not bring four witnesses, scourge them with eighty stripes, and do not receive any testimony of theirs ever, for these are the workers of abomination
Except such as repent after that and act aright, for, verily, God is forgiving and compassionate
And those who cast (imputation) on their wives and have no witnesses except themselves, then the testimony of one of them shall be to testify four times that, by God, he is of those who speak the truth
and the fifth testimony shall be that the curse of God shall be on him if he be of those who lie
And it shall avert the punishment from her if she bears testimony four times that, by God, he is of those who lie
and the fifth that the wrath of God shall be on her if he be of those who speak the truth
And were it not for God's grace upon you and His mercy, and that God is relenting, wise
Verily, those who bring forward the lie, a band of you,- reckon it not as an evil for you, nay, it is good for you; every man of them shall have what he has earned of sin; and he of them who managed to aggravate it, for him is mighty woe
Why did not, when ye heard it, the believing men and believing women think good in themselves, and say, 'This is an obvious lie
Why did they not bring four witnesses to it? but since they did not bring the witnesses, then they in God's eyes are the liars
And but for God's grace upon you, and His mercy in this world and the next, there would have touched you, for that which ye spread abroad, mighty woe
When ye reported it with your tongues, and spake with your mouths what ye had no knowledge of, and reckoned it a light thing, while in God's eyes it was grave
And why did ye not say when ye heard it, 'It is not for us to speak of this? Celebrated be His praises, this is a mighty calumny
God admonishes you that ye return not to the like of it ever, if ye be believers
and God manifests to you the signs, for God is knowing, wise
Verily, those who love that scandal should go abroad amongst those who believe, for them is grievous woe in this world and the next; for God knows, but ye do not know
And but for God's grace upon you, and His mercy, and that God is kind and compassionate
O ye who believe! follow not the footsteps of Satan, for he who follows the footsteps of Satan, verily, he bids you sin and do wrong; and but for God's grace upon you and His mercy, not one of you would be ever pure; but God purifies whom He will, for God both hears and knows
And let not those amongst you who have plenty and ample means swear that they will not give aught to their kinsman and the poor and those who have fled their homes in God's way, but let them pardon and pass it over. Do ye not like God to forgive you? and God is forgiving, compassionate
Verily, those who cast imputations on chaste women who are negligent but believing shall be cursed in this world and the next; and for them is mighty woe
The day when their tongues and hands and feet shall bear witness against them of what they did
on that day God will pay them their just due; and they shall know that God, He is the plain truth
The vile women to the vile men, and the vile men to the vile women; and the good women to the good men, and the good men to the good women: these are clear of what they say to them - forgiveness and a noble provision
O ye who believe! enter not into houses which are not your own houses, until ye have asked leave and saluted the people thereof, that is better for you; haply ye may be mindful
And if ye find no one therein, then do not enter them until permission is given you, and if it be said to you, 'Go back!' then go back, it is purer for you; for God of what ye do doth know
It is no crime against you that ye enter uninhabited houses,- a convenience for you;- and God knows what ye show and what ye hide
Say to the believers that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts; that is purer for them; verily, God is well aware of what they do
And say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their private parts, and display not their ornaments, except those which are outside; and let them pull their kerchiefs over their bosoms and not display their ornaments save to their husbands and fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or what their right hands possess, or their male attendants who are incapable, or to children who do not note women's nakedness; and that they beat not with their feet that their hidden ornaments may be known;- but turn ye all repentant to God, O ye believers haply ye may prosper
And marry the single amongst you, and the righteous among your servants and your handmaidens. If they be poor, God will enrich them of His grace, for God both comprehends and knows
And let those who cannot find a match, until God enriches them of His grace, keep chaste. And such of those whom your right hands possess as crave a writing, write it for them, if ye know any good in them, and give them of the wealth of God which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution, if they desire to keep continent, in order to crave the goods of the life of this world; but he who does compel them, then, verily, God after they are compelled is forgiving, compassionate
Now have we sent down to you manifest signs, and the like of those who have passed away before you, and as an admonition to those who fear
God is the light of the heavens and the earth; His light is as a niche in which is a lamp, and the lamp is in a glass, the glass is as though it were a glittering star; it is lit from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east nor of the west, the oil of which would well-nigh give light though no fire touched it,- light upon light!- God guides to His light whom He pleases; and God strikes out parables for men, and God all things doth know
In the houses God has permitted to be reared and His name to be mentioned therein - His praises are celebrated therein mornings and evenings
Men whom neither merchandize nor selling divert from the remembrance of God and steadfastness in prayer and giving alms, who fear a day when hearts and eyes shall be upset
that God may recompense them for the best that they have done, and give them increase of His grace; for God provides whom He pleases without count
But those who misbelieve, their works are like the mirage in a plain, the thirsty counts it water till when he comes to it he finds nothing, but he finds that God is with him; and He will pay him his account, for God is quick to take account
Or like darkness on a deep sea, there covers it a wave above which is a wave, above which is a cloud,- darknesses one above the other,- when one puts out his hand he can scarcely see it; for he to whom God has given no light, he has no light
Hast thou not seen that God,- all who are in the heavens and the earth celebrate His praises, and the birds too spreading out their wings; each one knows its prayer and its praise, and God knows what they do
Missing
Hast thou not seen that God drives the clouds, and then re-unites them, and then accumulates them, and thou mayest see the rain coming forth from their midst; and He sends down from the sky mountains with hail therein, and He makes it fall on whom He pleases, and He turns it from whom He pleases; the flashing of His lightning well-nigh goes off with their sight
God interchanges the night and the day; verily, in that is a lesson to those endowed with sight
And God created every beast from water, and of them is one that walks upon its belly, and of them one that walks upon two feet, and of them one that walks upon four. God creates what He pleases; verily, God is mighty over all
Now have we sent down manifest signs, and God guides whom He pleases unto the right way
They will say, 'We believe in God and in the Apostle, and we obey.' Then a sect of them turned their backs after that, and they are not believers
And when they are called to God and His Apostle to judge between them, lo! a sect of them do turn aside
But had the right been on their side they would have come to him submissively enough
Is there a sickness in their hearts, or do they doubt, or do they fear lest God and His Apostle should deal unfairly by them?- Nay, it is they who are unjust
The speech of the believers, when they are called to God and His Apostle to judge between them, is only to say, 'We hear and we obey;' and these it is who are the prosperous
for whoso obeys God and His Apostle and dreads God and fears Him, these it is who are the happy
They swear by God with their most strenuous oath that hadst Thou ordered them they would surely go forth. Say, 'Do not swear - reasonable obedience; verily, God knows what ye do
Say, 'Obey God and obey the Apostle; but if ye turn your backs he has only his burden to bear, and ye have only your burden to bear. But if ye obey him, ye are guided; but the Apostle has only his plain message to deliver
God promises those of you who believe and do right that He will give them the succession in the earth as He gave the succession to those before them, and He will establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them, and to give them, after their fear, safety in exchange.;- they shall worship me, they shall not associate aught with me: but whoso disbelieves after that, those it is who are the sinners
And be steadfast in prayer and give alms and obey the Apostle, haply ye may obtain mercy
Do not reckon that those who misbelieve can frustrate (God) in the earth, for their resort is the Fire, and an ill journey shall it be
O ye who believe! let those whom your right hands possess, and those amongst you who have not reached puberty, ask leave of you three times: before the prayer of dawn, and when ye put off your clothes at noon, and after the evening prayer;- three times of privacy for you: there is no crime on either you or them after these while ye are continually going one about the other. Thus does God explain to you His signs, for God is knowing, wise
And when your children reach puberty let them ask leave as those before them asked leave. Thus does God explain to you His signs, for God is knowing, wise
And those women who have stopped (child-bearing), who do not hope for a match, it is no crime on them that they put off their clothes so as not to display their ornaments; but that they abstain is better for them, for God both hears and knows
There is no hindrance to the blind, and no hindrance to the lame, and no hindrance to the sick, and none upon yourselves that you eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your paternal uncles, or the houses of your paternal aunts, or the houses of your maternal uncles, or the houses of your maternal aunts, or what ye possess the keys of, or of your friend, there is no crime on you that ye eat all together or separately. And when ye enter houses then greet each other with a salutation from God, blessed and good. Thus does God explain to you His signs, haply ye may understand
Only those are believers who believe in God and His Apostle, and when they are with Him upon public business go not away until they have asked his leave; verily, those who ask thy leave they it is who believe in God and His Apostle. But when they ask thy leave for any of their own concerns, then give leave to whomsoever thou wilt of them, and ask pardon for them of God; verily, God is forgiving and merciful
Make not the calling of the Apostle amongst yourselves like your calling one to the other; God knows those of you who withdraw themselves covertly. And let those who disobey his order beware lest there befall them some trial or there befall them grievous woe
Ay, God's is what is in the heavens and the earth, He knows what ye are at; and the day ye shall be sent back to Him then He will inform you of what ye have done, for God all things doth know
Blessed be He who sent down the Discrimination to His servant that he might be unto the world a warner
whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and who has not taken to Himself a son, and who has no partner in His kingdom, and created everything, and then decreed it determinately
And they take beside Him gods who create not aught, but are themselves created, and cannot control for themselves harm or profit, and cannot control death, or life, or resurrection
And those who misbelieve say, 'This is nothing but a lie which he has forged, and another people hath helped him at it;' but they have wrought an injustice and a falsehood
And they say, 'Old folks' tales, which he has got written down while they are dictated to him morning and evening
Say, 'He sent it down who knows the secret in the heavens and the earth; verily, He is ever forgiving, merciful
And they say, 'What ails this prophet that he eats food and walks in the markets?- unless there be sent down to him an angel and be a warner with him
Or there be thrown to him a treasury or he have a garden to eat therefrom .... !' and the unjust say, 'Ye only follow an infatuated man
See how they strike out for thee parables, and err, and cannot find a way
Blessed be He who, if He please, can make for thee better than that, gardens beneath which rivers flow, and can make for thee castles
Nay, but they call the Hour a lie; but we have prepared for those who call the Hour a lie a blaze
when it seizes them from a far-off place they shall hear its raging and roaring
and when they are thrown into a narrow place thereof, fastened together, they shall call there for destruction
Call not today for one destruction, but call, for many destructions
Say, 'Is that better or the garden of eternity which was promised to those who fear - which is ever for them a recompense and a retreat
They shall have therein what they please, to dwell therein for aye: that is of thy Lord a promise to be demanded
And the day He shall gather them and what they served beside God, and He shall say, 'Was it ye who led my servants here astray, or did they err from the way
They shall say, 'Celebrated be Thy praise, it was not befitting for us to take any patrons but Thee; but Thou didst give them and their fathers enjoyment until they forgot the Reminder and were a lost people
And now have they proved you liars for what ye say, and they cannot ward off or help. And he of you who does wrong we will make him taste great torment
We have not sent before thee any messengers but that they ate food and walked in the markets; but we have made some of you a trial to others: will ye be patient? thy Lord doth ever look
And those who do not hope to meet us say, 'Unless the angels be sent down to us, or we see our Lord....!' They are too big with pride in their souls and they have exceeded with a great excess
The day they shall see the angels,- no glad tidings on that day for the sinners, and they shall say, 'It is rigorously forbidden
And we will go on to the works which they have done, and make them like motes in a sunbeam scattered
The fellows of Paradise on that day shall be in a better abiding-place and a better noonday rest
The day the heavens shall be cleft asunder with the clouds, and the angels shall be sent down descending
The true kingdom on that day shall belong to the Merciful, and it shall be a hard day for the misbelievers
And the day when the unjust shall bite his hands and say, 'O, would that I had taken a way with the Apostle
O, woe is me! would that I had not taken such a one for a friend now
for he did lead me astray from the Reminder after it had come to me, for Satan leaves man in the lurch
The Apostle said, 'O my Lord! verily, my people have taken this Qur'an to be obsolete
Thus have we made for every prophet an enemy from among the sinners; but thy Lord is good guide and helper enough
Those who misbelieve said, 'Unless the Qur'an be sent down to him all at once...!' - thus - that we may stablish thy heart therewith, did we reveal it piecemeal
Nor shall they come to thee with a parable without our bringing thee the truth and the best interpretation
They who shall be gathered upon their faces to hell,- these are in the worst place, and err most from the path
And we did give to Moses the Book, and place with him his brother Aaron as a minister
and we said, 'Go ye to the people who say our signs are lies, for we will destroy them with utter destruction
And the people of Noah, when they said the apostles were liars, we drowned them, and we made them a sign for men; and we prepared for the unjust a grievous woe
And 'Ad and Thamud and the people of ar Rass, and many generations between them
For each one have we struck out parables, and each one have we ruined with utter ruin
Why, they have come past the cities which were rained on with an evil rain; have they not seen them?- nay, they do not hope to be raised up again
And when they saw thee they only took thee for a jest, 'Is this he whom God has sent as an apostle
he well-nigh leads us astray from our gods, had we not been patient about them.' But they shall know, when they see the torment, who errs most from the path
Dost thou consider him who takes his lusts for his god? wilt thou then be in charge over him
or dost thou reckon that most of them will hear or understand? they are only like the cattle, nay, they err more from the way
Hast thou not looked to thy Lord how He prolongs the shadow? but had He willed He would have made it stationary; then we make the sun a guide thereto
then we contract it towards us with an easy contraction
And He it is who made the night for a garment; and sleep for repose, and made the day for men to rise up again
And He it is who sent the winds with glad tidings before His mercy; and we send down from the heavens pure water
to quicken therewith the dead country, and to give it for drink to what we have created,- the cattle and many folk
We have turned it in various ways amongst them that they may remember; though most men refuse aught but to misbelieve
But, had we pleased, we would have sent in every city a warner
So obey not the unbelievers and fight strenuously with them in many a strenuous fight
He it is who has let loose the two seas, this one sweet and fresh, that one bitter and pungent, and has made between them a rigorous prohibition
And he it is who has created man from water, and has made for him blood relationship and marriage relationship; for thy Lord is mighty
Yet they worship beside God what can neither profit them nor harm them; but he who misbelieves in his Lord backs up (the devil)
We have only sent thee to give glad tidings and to warn
Say, 'I ask you not for it a hire unless one please to take unto his Lord a way
And rely thou upon the Living One who dies not; and celebrate His praise, for He knows well enough about the thoughts of His servants
He who created the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, in six days, and then made for the throne; the Merciful One, ask concerning Him of One who is aware
And when it is said, ' Adore ye the Merciful!' they say, 'What is the Merciful? shall we adore what thou dost order us?' and it only increases their aversion
Blessed be He who placed in the heavens zodiacal signs, and placed therein the lamp and an illuminating moon
And He it is who made the night and the day alternating for him who desires to remember or who wishes to be thankful
And the servants of the Merciful are those who walk upon the earth lowly, and when the ignorant address them, say, 'Peace
And those who pass the night adoring their Lord and standing
and those who say, 'O our Lord! turn from us the torment of hell; verily, its torments are persistent
verily, they are evil as an abode and a station
And those who when they spend are neither extravagant nor miserly, but who ever take their stand between the two
and who call not upon another god with God; and kill not the soul which God has prohibited save deservedly; and do not commit fornication: for he who does that shall meet with a penalty
doubled for him shall be the torment on the resurrection day, and he shall be therein for aye despised
Save he who turns again and believes and does a righteous work; for, as to those, God will change their evil deeds to good, for God is ever forgiving, merciful
And he who turns again and does right, verily, he turns again to God repentant
And those who do not testify falsely; and when they pass by frivolous discourse, pass by it honourably
and those who when they are reminded of the signs of their Lord do not fall down thereat deaf and blind
and those who say, 'Our Lord! grant us from our wives and seed that which may cheer our eyes, and make us models to the pious
These shall be rewarded with a high place for that they were patient: and they shall meet therein with salutation and peace
to dwell therein for aye; a good abode and station shall it be
Say, 'My Lord cares not for you though you should not call (on Him); and ye have called (the Apostle) a liar, but it shall be (a punishment) which ye cannot shake off
M
Those are the signs of the perspicuous Book
haply thou art vexing thyself to death that they will not be believers
If we please we will send down upon them from the heaven a sign, and their necks shall be humbled thereto
But there comes not to them any recent Reminder from the Merciful One that they do not turn away from
They have called (thee) liar! but there shall come to them a message of that at which they mocked
Have they not looked to the earth, how we caused to grow therein of every noble kind
verily, in that is a sign; but most of them will never be believers
but, verily, thy Lord He is mighty and merciful
And when thy Lord called Moses (saying), 'Come to the unjust people
to the people of Pharaoh, will they not fear
Said he, 'My Lord! verily, I fear that they will call me liar
and my breast is straitened, and my tongue is not fluent; send then unto Aaron
for they have a crime against me, and I fear that they may kill me
Said He, 'Not so; but go with our signs, verily, we are with you listening
And go to Pharaoh and say, "Verily, we are the apostles of the Lord of the worlds
(to tell thee to) send with us the children of Israel
And he said, 'Did we not bring thee up amongst us as a child? and thou didst dwell amongst us for years of thy life
and thou didst do thy deed which thou hast done, and thou art of the ungrateful
Said he, 'I did commit this, and I was of those who erred
And I fled from you when I feared you, and my Lord granted me judgment, and made me one of His messengers
and this is the favour thou hast obliged me with, that thou hast enslaved the children of Israel
Said Pharaoh, 'Who is the Lord of the worlds
Said he, 'The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between the two, if ye are but sure
Said he to those about him, 'Do ye not listen
Said he, 'Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of yore
Said he, 'Verily, your apostle who is sent to you is surely mad
Said he, 'The Lord of the east and of the west, and of what is between the two, if ye had but sense
Said he, 'If thou dost take a god besides Me I will surely make thee one of the imprisoned
Said he, 'What, if I come to thee with something obvious
Said he, 'Bring it, if thou art of those who tell the truth
And he threw down his rod, and, behold, it was an obvious serpent
and he plucked out his hand, and, behold, it was white to the spectators
He said to the chiefs around him, 'Verily, this is a knowing sorcerer
he desires to turn you out of your land! what is it then ye bid
They said, 'Give him and his brother some hope, and send into the cities to collect
and bring to thee every knowing sorcerer
And the sorcerers assembled at the appointed time on a stated day
and it was said to the people, 'Are ye assembled
haply we may follow the sorcerers if we gain the upper hand
And when the sorcerers came they said to Pharaoh, 'Shall we, verily, have a hire if we gain the upper hand
Said he, 'Yes; and, verily, ye shall then be of those who are nigh (my throne)
And Moses said to them, 'Throw down what ye have to throw down
So they threw down their ropes and their rods and said, 'By Pharaoh's might, verily, we it is who shall gain the upper hand
And Moses threw down his rod, and, lo, it swallowed up what they falsely devised
And the sorcerers threw themselves down, adoring
Said they, 'We believe in the Lord of the worlds
the Lord of Moses and Aaron
Said he, 'Do ye believe in Him ere I give you leave? Verily, he is your chief who has taught you sorcery, but soon ye shall know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides, and I will crucify you all together
They said, 'No harm; verily, unto our Lord do we return
verily, we hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, for we are the first of believers
And we inspired Moses, 'Journey by night with my servants; verily, ye are pursued
And Pharaoh sent into the cities to collect
Verily, these are a small company
And, verily, they are enraged with us
but we are a multitude, wary
Turn them out of gardens and springs
and treasuries, and a noble station
thus, - and we made the children of Israel to inherit them
And they followed them at dawn

Those are the signs of the Qur'an and the perspicuous Book
a guidance and glad tidings to the believers
who are steadfast at prayer, and give alms, and of the hereafter are sure

Those are the signs of the perspicuous Book
we recite to thee from the history of Moses and Pharaoh in truth unto a people who believe
Verily, Pharaoh was lofty in the land and made the people thereof sects; one party of them he weakened, slaughtering their sons and letting their women live. Verily, he was of the despoilers
And we wished to be gracious to those who were weakened in the earth, and to make them models, and to make them the heirs
and to establish for them in the earth; and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts what they had to beware of from them
And we inspired the mother of Moses, 'Suckle him; and when thou art afraid for him then throw him into the river, and fear not and grieve not; verily, we are going to restore him to thee, and to make him of the apostles
And Pharaoh's family picked him up that he might be for them a foe and a grief; verily, Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were sinners
And Pharaoh's wife said, 'He is a cheering of the eye to me, and to thee. Kill him not; it may be that he will profit us, or that we may take him for a son;' for they did not perceive
And the heart of Moses' mother was void on the morrow; she well-nigh disclosed him, had it not been that we bound up her heart that she might be of the believers
And she said to his sister, 'Follow him up.' And she looked after him from afar, and they did not perceive
And we made unlawful for him the wet-nurses. And she said, 'Shall I guide you to the people of a house who will take care of him for you, and who will be sincere respecting him
So we restored him to his mother that her eye might be cheered, and that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of God is true, though most of them know not
And when he reached puberty, and was settled, we gave him judgment and knowledge; for thus do we reward those who do well
And he entered into the city at the time the people thereof were heedless, and he found therein two men fighting; the one of his sect and the other of his foes. And he who was of his sect asked his aid against him who was of his foes; and Moses smote him with his fist and finished him. Said he, 'This is of the work of Satan, verily, he is a misleading obvious foe
Said he, 'My Lord! verily, I have wronged my soul, but forgive me.' So He forgave him; for He is forgiving and merciful
Said he, 'My Lord! for that Thou hast been gracious to me, I will surely not back up the sinners
And on the morrow he was afraid in the city, expectant. And behold, he whom he had helped the day before cried (again) to him for aid. Said Moses to Him, 'Verily, thou art obviously quarrelsome
And when he wished to assault him who was the enemy to them both, he said, 'O Moses! dost thou desire to kill me as thou didst kill a person yesterday? thou dost only desire to be a tyrant in the earth; and thou dost not desire to be of those who do right
And a man came from the remote parts of the city running, said he, 'O Moses! verily, the chiefs are deliberating concerning thee to kill thee; go then forth; verily, I am to you a sincere adviser
So he went forth therefrom, afraid and expectant. Said he, 'Lord, save me from the unjust people
And when he turned his face in the direction of Midian, he said, 'It may be that my Lord will guide me to a level path
And when he went down to the water of Midian he found thereat a nation of people watering their flocks. And he found beside them two women keeping back their flocks. Said he, 'What is your design?' They said, 'We cannot water our flocks until the herdsmen have finished; for our father is a very old man
So he watered for them; then he turned back towards the shade and said, 'My Lord! verily, I stand in need of what Thou sendest down to me of good
And one of the two came to him walking modestly; said she, 'Verily; my father calls thee, to reward thee with hire for having watered our flocks for us.' And when he came to him and related to him the story, said he, ' Fear not, thou art safe from the unjust people
Said one of them, 'O my sire! hire him; verily, the best of those whom thou canst hire is the strong and faithful
Said he, 'Verily, I desire to marry thee to one of these daughters of mine, on condition that thou dost serve me for hire eight years; and if thou shalt fulfil ten it is of thyself; for I do not wish to make it wretched for thee; thou wilt find me, if it please God, of the righteous
Said he, 'That is between you and me; whichever of the two terms I fulfil, let there be no enmity against me, for God over what we say keeps guard
And when Moses had fulfilled the appointed time, and was journeying with his people, he perceived from the side of the mountain a fire; said he to his people, 'Tarry ye here; verily, I have perceived a fire, haply I may bring you good news therefrom, or a brand of fire that haply ye may be warmed
And when he came to it he was called to, from the right side of the wady, in the blessed valley, out of the tree, 'O Moses! verily, I am God the Lord of the worlds
so throw down thy rod;' and when he saw it quivering as though it were a snake, he turned away and fled and did not return. 'O Moses! approach and fear not, verily, thou art amongst the safe
Thrust thy hand into thy bosom, it shall come out white, without hurt; and then fold again thy wing, that thou dost now stretch out through dread; for those are two signs from thy Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs; verily, they are a people who work abomination
Said he, 'My Lord! verily, I have killed a person amongst them, and I fear that they will kill me
and my brother Aaron, he is more eloquent of tongue than I; send him then with me as a support, to verify me; verily, I fear that they will call me liar

and we followed them up in this world with a curse; and on the resurrection day they shall be abhorred
And we gave Moses the Book, after that we had destroyed the former generations, as an insight to men and a guidance and a mercy; haply they may be mindful
Thou wast not upon the western side when we decided for Moses, but afar off; nor wast thou of the witnesses
But we raised up (other) generations, and life was prolonged for them; and thou wast not staying amidst the people of Midian, reciting to them our signs; but we were sending our apostles
Nor wast thou by the side of the mountain when we called; but it is a mercy from thy Lord, that thou mayest warn a people to whom no warner has come before thee; haply they may be mindful
And lest there should befall them a mishap for what their hands have sent before, and they should say, 'Our Lord! why didst thou not send to us an apostle? for we would have followed thy signs and been of the believers
And when the truth comes to them from us they say, 'We are given the like of what Moses was given.' Did they not disbelieve in what Moses was given before?- they say, 'Two works of sorcery back up each other;' and they say, 'Verily, we do disbelieve in all
Say, 'Bring, then, a book from God which shall be a better guide than both, and I will follow it, if ye do tell the truth

and when it is recited to them they say, 'We believe in it as truth from our Lord; verily, we were resigned before it came
These shall be given their hire twice over, for that they were patient, and repelled evil with good, and of what we have bestowed upon them give alms
And when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say, 'We have our works, and ye have your works. Peace be upon you! we do not seek the ignorant
Verily, thou canst not guide whom thou dost like, but God guides whom He pleases; for He knows best who are to be guided
And they say, 'If we follow the guidance we shall be snatched away from the land.' Have we not established for them a safe sanctuary, to which are imported the fruits of everything as a provision from us? but most of them do not know
How many a city have we destroyed that exulted in its means of subsistence? These are their dwellings, never dwelt in after them, except a little; for we were the heirs
But thy Lord would never destroy cities until He sent to the metropolis thereof an apostle, to recite to them our signs; nor would we destroy cities unless their people were unjust
Whatever thing ye may be given, it is a provision for this world's life and the adornment thereof; but what is with God is better and more enduring; have ye then no sense

And the day when He shall call them and shall say, 'What was it ye answered the apostles
and the history shall be blindly confusing to them on that day, and they shall not ask each other
But, as for him who turns again and believes and does right, it may be that he will be among the prosperous
For thy Lord creates what He pleases and chooses; they have not the choice! Celebrated be the praise of God! and exalted be He above what they associate with Him
Thy Lord knows what they conceal in their breasts and what they manifest
He is God, there is no god but He; to Him belongs praise, in the first and the last; and His is the judgment; and unto Him shall ye return
Have ye considered, if God were to make for you the night endless until the resurrection day, who is the god, but God, to bring you light? can ye not then hear
Say, 'Have ye considered, if God were to make for you the day endless until the day of judgment, who is the god, except God, to bring you the night to rest therein? can ye not then see

They shall pass to and fro therein a cup in which is neither folly nor sin
And round them shall go boys of theirs, as though they were hidden pearls
And they shall accost each other and ask questions
and shall say, 'Verily, we were before amidst our families shrinking with terror
but God has been gracious to us and saved us from the torment of the hot blast
Verily, we used to call on Him before; verily, He is the righteous, the compassionate
Wherefore do thou remind them: for thou art, by the favour of thy Lord, neither a soothsayer nor mad
Will they say, 'A poet; we wait for him the sad accidents of fate
Say, 'Wait ye then; for I too am of those who wait
Do their dreams bid them this? or are they an outrageous people
Or will they say, 'He has invented it?' - nay, but they do not believe
But let them bring a discourse like it, if they tell the truth
Or were they created of nothing, or were they the creators
Or did they create the heavens and the earth? - nay, but they are not sure
Or have they the treasures of thy Lord? or are they the governors supreme
Or have they a ladder whereon they can listen?- then let their listener bring obvious authority
Has He daughters, while ye have sons
Or dost thou ask them a hire, while they are borne down by debt
Or have they the unseen, so that they write it down
Or do they desire a plot? - but those who misbelieve it is who are plotted against
Or have they a god beside God? celebrated be God's praises above what they join with Him
But if they should see a fragment of the sky falling down, they would say, 'Clouds in masses
But leave them till they meet that day of theirs whereon they shall swoon
the day when their plotting shall avail them naught, and they shall not be helped
And, verily, there is a torment beside that for those who do wrong; but most of them do not know
But wait thou patiently for the judgment of thy Lord, for thou art in our eyes. And celebrate the praises of thy Lord what time thou risest
and in the night, and at the fading of the stars
By the star when it falls
your comrade errs not, nor is he deluded
nor speaks he out of lust
It is but an inspiration inspired
One mighty in power taught him
endowed with sound understanding, and appeared
he being in the loftiest tract
Then drew he near and hovered o'er
until he was two bows length off or nigher still
Then he inspired his servant what he inspired him
the heart belies not what he saw
What, will ye dispute with him on what he saw
And he saw him another time
by the lote tree none may pass
near which is the garden of the Abode
When there covered the lote tree what did cover it
The sight swerved not nor wandered
He saw then the greatest of the signs of his Lord
Have ye considered Allat and Al 'Huzza
and Manat the other third
Shall there be male offspring for Him and female for you
That were an unfair division
They are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers! God has sent down no authority for them! They do but follow suspicion and what their souls lust after!- And yet there has come to them guidance from their Lord
Shall man have what he desires
But God's is the hereafter and the present
How many an angel in the heaven!- their intercession avails not at all, save after God has given permission to whomsoever He will and is pleased with
Verily, those who believe not in the hereafter do surely name the angels with female names
but they have no knowledge thereof; they do but follow suspicion, and, verily, suspicion shall not avail against the truth at all
But turn aside from him who turns his back upon our remembrance and desires naught but this world's life
This is their sum of knowledge; verily, thy Lord knows best who has erred from His way, and He knows best who is guided
God's is what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil for what they have done; and may reward those who do good with good
those who shun great sins and iniquities,- all but venial faults,- verily, thy Lord is of ample forgiveness; He knows best about you, when He produced you from the earth, and when ye were embryos in the wombs of your mothers. Make not yourselves out, then, to be pure; He knows best who it is that fears
Hast thou considered him who turns his back
who gives but little and then stops
Has he then the knowledge of the unseen, so that he can see
Has he not been informed of what is in the pages of Moses
and Abraham who fulfilled his word
that no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another
and that man shall have only that for which he strives
and that his striving shall at length be seen
Then shall he be rewarded for it with the most full reward
and that unto thy Lord is the limit
and that it is He who makes men laugh and weep
and that it is He who kills and makes alive
and that He created pairs, male and female
from a clot when it is emitted
and that for Him is the next production
and that he enriches and gives possession
and that He is the Lord of the Dog-star
and that He it was who destroyed 'Ad of yore
and Thamud, and left none of them
and the people of Noah before them,- verily, they were most unjust and outrageous
And the overthrown (cities) He threw down
and there covered them what did cover them
Which then of your Lord's benefits do ye dispute
This is a warner, one of the warners of yore
The approaching day approaches
there, is none to discover it but God
At this new discourse then do ye wonder
and do ye laugh and not weep
and ye divert yourselves the while
But adore God and serve (Him)
The Hour draws nigh, and the moon is split asunder
But if they see a sign they turn aside and say, 'Magic, continuous
And they call it a lie and follow their lusts; but every matter is settled
There has come to them some information with restraint in it
wisdom far-reaching - but warners avail not
But turn thy back on them! The day when the caller shall call to an awkward thing
Humbly casting down their looks shall they come forth from their graves, as though they were locusts scattered abroad
Hurrying forwards to the caller! the misbelievers shall say, 'This is a difficult day
Noah's people before them called (the apostles) liars; they called our servant a liar; and they said, 'Mad!' and he was rejected
And he called upon his Lord, 'Verily, I am overcome, come then to my help
And we opened the gates of heaven with water pouring down
And we made the earth burst forth in springs, and the waters met at a bidding already decreed
But we bore him on the thing of planks and nails
sailing on beneath our eyes, a reward for him who had been disbelieved
And we left it a sign;- but is there any one who will mind
Not identifiable
Not identifiable
Ad called the apostles liars, and how was my punishment and my warning
Verily, we sent on them a cold storm wind on a day of continuous ill-luck
It reft men away as though they had been palm stumps torn up
Not identifiable
We have made the Qur'an easy as a reminder - but is there any one who will mind
Thamud called the warnings lies
and said, 'A mortal, one of us, alone, shall we follow him? then indeed were we in error and excitement
Is the warning cast on him alone among us? nay, he is an insolent liar
They shall know to-morrow about the insolent liar
Verily, we are about to send the she-camel as a trial for them, then watch them and have patience
and inform them that the water is shared between them (and her); each draught shall be sought by turns
Then they called their companion, and he plied (a knife) and hamstrung her
Then how was my punishment and my warning
Verily, we sent against them one noise, and they were like the dry sticks of him who builds a fold
We have made the Qur'an easy as a reminder - but is there any one who will mind
Lot's people called the apostles liars
verily, we sent against them a heavy sand storm; all, save Lot's family, we saved them at the dawn
As a favour from us; so do we reward him who gives thanks
He indeed had warned them of our assault, but they doubted of the warning
And they desired his guest, and we put out their eyes.- 'So taste ye my torment and warning
And there overtook them on the morning a settled punishment
So taste ye my torment and warning
We have made the Qur'an easy as a reminder - but is there any one who will mind
The warning came to Pharaoh's people
they called, our signs all lies, and we seized on them with the seizing of a mighty powerful one
Are your misbelievers better than they? or have ye an exemption in the Scriptures
Or do they say we are a victorious company
The whole shall be routed and shall turn their backs in flight
Nay, the Hour is their promised time! and the Hour is most severe and bitter
Verily, the sinners are in error and excitement
On the day when they shall be dragged to the fire upon their faces!- 'Taste ye the touch of hell
Verily, everything have we created by decree
and our bidding is but one (word), like the twinkling of an eye
We have destroyed the like of you - but is there any who will mind
And everything they do is in the books
and everything small and great is written down
Verily, the pious shall be amid gardens and rivers
in the seat of truth, with the powerful king
The Merciful
taught the Qur'an
He created man
taught him plain speech
The sun and the moon have their appointed time
The herbs and the trees adore
And the heavens, He raised them and set the balance
that ye should not be outrageous in the balance
But weigh ye aright, and stint not the balance
And the earth He has set it for living creatures
therein are fruits and palms, with sheaths
and grain with chaff and frequent shoots
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
He created men of crackling clay like the potters
And He created the ginn from smokeless fire
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
The Lord of the two easts and the Lord of the two wests
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
He has let loose the two seas that meet together
between them is a barrier they cannot pass
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
He brings forth from each pearls both large and small
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
His are the ships which rear aloft in the sea like mountains
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Every one upon it is transient
but the face of thy Lord endowed with majesty and honour shall endure
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Of Him whosoever is in the heaven and the earth does beg; every day He is in (some fresh) business
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
We shall be at leisure for you, O ye two weighty ones
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
O assembly of ginns and mankind! if ye are able to pass through the confines of heaven and earth then pass through them!- ye cannot pass through save by authority
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
There shall be sent against you a flash or fire, and molten copper, and ye shall not be helped
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
And when the heaven is rent asunder and become rosy red - (melting) like grease
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
On that day neither man nor ginn shall be asked about his crime
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
The sinners shall be known by their marks, and shall be seized by the forelock and the feet
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
This is hell, which the sinners did call a lie
they shall circulate between it and water boiling quite
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
But for him who fears the station of his Lord are gardens twain
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Both furnished with branching trees
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
In each are flowing springs
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
In each are, of every fruit, two kinds
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Reclining on beds the linings of which are of brocade, and the fruit of the two gardens within reach to cull
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Therein are maids of modest glances whom no man nor ginn has deflowered before
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
As though they were rubies and pearls
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Is the reward of goodness aught but goodness
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
And besides these, are gardens twain
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
With dark green foliage
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
In each two gushing springs
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
In each fruit and palms and pomegranates
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
In them maidens best and fairest
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Bright and large-eyed maids kept in their tents
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Whom no man nor ginn has deflowered before them
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets
Then which of your Lord's bounties will ye twain deny
Blessed be the name of thy Lord possessed of majesty and honour
When the inevitable happens
none shall call its happening a lie
abasing - exalting
When the earth shall quake, quaking
and the mountains shall crumble, crumbling
and become like motes dispersed
And ye shall be three sorts
And the fellows of the right hand - what right lucky fellows
And the fellows of the left hand - what unlucky fellows
And the foremost foremost
These are they who are brought nigh
In gardens of pleasure
A crowd of those of yore
And a few of those of the latter day
And gold-weft couches
reclining on them face to face
Around them shall go eternal youths
with goblets and ewers and a cup of flowing wine
no headache shall they feel therefrom, nor shall their wits be dimmed
And fruits such as they deem the best
And flesh of fowl as they desire
And bright and large-eyed maids
like hidden pearls
A reward for that which they have done
They shall hear no folly there and no sin
Only the speech, 'Peace, Peace
And the fellows of the right - what right lucky fellows
Amid thornless lote trees
And tall trees with piles of fruit
And outspread shade
And water out-poured
And fruit in abundance
neither failing nor forbidden
And beds upraised
Verily, we have produced them a production
And made them virgins
darlings of equal age (with their spouses)
for the fellows of the right
A crowd of those of yore
and a crowd of those of the latter day
And the fellows of the left - what unlucky fellows
In hot blasts and boiling water
And a shade of pitchy smoke
Neither cool nor generous
Verily, they were affluent ere this
and did persist in mighty crime
and used to say, 'What, when we die and have become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be raised
or our fathers of yore
Say, 'Verily, those of yore and those of the latter day
shall surely be gathered together unto the tryst of the well-known day
Then ye, O ye who err! who say it is a lie
shall eat of the Zaqqum tree
and fill your bellies with it
and drink thereon of boiling water
and drink as drinks the thirsty camel
This is their entertainment on the judgment day
We created you, then why do ye not credit
Have ye considered what ye emit
Do we create it, or are we the creators
We have decreed amongst you death; but we are not forestalled
from making the likes of you in exchange, or producing you as ye know not of
Ye do know the first production - why then do ye not mind
Have ye considered what ye till
Do ye make it bear seed, or do we make it bear seed
If we pleased we could make it mere grit, so that ye would pause to marvel
Verily, we have got into debt
and we are excluded
Have ye considered the water which ye drink
Do ye make it come down from the clouds, or do we make it come down
If we pleased we could make it pungent - why then do ye not give thanks
Have ye considered the fire which ye strike
Do ye produce the tree that gives it, or do we produce it
We have made it a memorial and a chattel for the traveller of the waste
Then celebrate the grand name of thy Lord
So I will not swear by the positions of the stars
and, verily, it is a grand oath if ye did but know
that, verily, this is the honourable Qur'an
in the laid-up Book
Let none touch it but the purified
A revelation from the Lord of the worlds
What! this new discourse will ye despise
And make for your provision, that you call it a lie
Why then - when it comes up to the throat
and ye at that time look on
though we are nearer to him than you are, but ye cannot see
why, if ye are not to be judged
do ye not send it back, if ye do tell the truth
But either, if he be of those brought nigh to God
then rest and fragrance and the garden of pleasure
Or, if he be of the fellows of the right
then 'Peace to thee!' from the fellows of the right
Or, if he be of those who say it is a lie,- who err
then an entertainment of boiling water
and broiling in hell
Verily, this is surely certain truth
So celebrate the grand name of thy Lord
Whatever is in the heavens and the earth celebrates the praises of God, for He is the mighty, the wise
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth: He quickens and He kills, and He is mighty over all
He is the first and the last; and the outer and the inner; and He all things doth know
He it is who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He made for the throne; and He knows what goes into the earth and what goes forth therefrom, and what comes down from the sky and what goes up therein, and He is with you wheresoe'er ye be: for God on what ye do doth look
His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and unto God affairs return
He makes the night succeed the day, and makes the day succeed the night; and He knows the nature of men's breasts
Believe in God and His Apostle, and give alms of what He has made you successors of. For those amongst you who believe and give alms - for them is mighty hire
What ails you that ye do not believe in God and His Apostle? He calls on you to believe in your Lord; and He has taken a compact from you, if ye be believers
He it is who sends down upon His servants manifest signs, to bring you forth from the darkness into the light; for, verily, God to you is kind, compassionate
What ails you that ye give not alms in God's cause? for God's is the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. Not alike amongst you is he who gives alms before the victory and fights,- they are grander in rank than those who give alms afterwards and fight. But to all does God promise good; and God of what ye do is well aware
Who is there who will lend a good loan to God? for He will double it for him, and for him is a generous reward
On the day when thou shalt see believers, men and women, with their light running on before them and on their right hand,- 'Glad tidings for you today.- Gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; that is the grand bliss
On the day when the hypocrites, men and women, shall say to those who believe, 'Wait for us that we may kindle at your light.' It will be said, 'Get ye back, and beg a light.' And there shall be struck out between them a wall with a door; within it shall be mercy, and outside before it torment
They shall cry out to them, 'We were not with you!' they shall say, 'Yea, but ye did tempt yourselves, and did wait, and did doubt; and your vain hopes beguiled you; and the beguiler beguiled you about God
Wherefore today there shall not be taken from you a ransom, nor from those who misbelieved. Your resort is the fire; it is your sovereign, and an ill journey will it be
Is the time come to those who believe, for their hearts to be humbled at the remembrance of God, and of what He has sent down in truth? and for them not to, be like those who were given the Scriptures before, And over whom time was prolonged, but their hearts grew hard, and many of them were workers of abomination
Know that God quickens the earth after its death!- we have manifested to you the signs; haply ye may have some sense
Verily, those who give in charity, men and women, who have lent to God a goodly loan,- it shall be doubled for them, and for them is a generous hire
And those who believe in God and His Apostle, they are the confessors and the martyrs with their Lord; for them is their hire and their light! But those who misbelieve and call our signs lies, they are the fellows of hell
Know that the life of this world is but a sport, and a play, and an adornment, and something to boast of amongst yourselves; and the multiplying of children is like a rain-growth, its vegetation pleases the misbelievers; then they wither away, and thou mayest see them become yellow; then they become but grit. But in the hereafter is a severe woe, and forgiveness from God and His goodwill; but the life of this world is but a chattel of guile
Race towards forgiveness from your Lord and Paradise, whose breadth is as the breadth of the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who believe in God and His apostles! and God's grace, He gives it to whom He pleases, for God is Lord of mighty grace
No accident befalls in the earth, or in yourselves, but it was in the Book, before we created them verily, that is easy unto God
That ye may not vex yourselves for what ye miss, nor be overjoyed at what He gives you; for God loves no arrogant boaster
who are niggardly and bid men be niggardly: but whoso turns his back, verily, God is rich, praiseworthy
We did send our apostles with manifest signs; and we did send down among you the Book and the balance, that men might stand by justice; and we sent down iron in which is both keen violence and advantages to men; and that God might know who helps Him and His apostles in secret; verily, God is strong and mighty
And we sent Noah and Abraham; and placed in their seed prophecy and the Book; and some of them are guided, though many of them are workers of abomination
Then we followed up their footsteps with our apostles; and we followed them up with Jesus the son of Mary; and we gave him the gospel; and we placed in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and compassion.- But monkery, they invented it; we only prescribed to them the craving after the goodwill of God, and they observed it not with due observance. But we gave to those who believe amongst them their hire; though many amongst them were workers of abomination
O ye who believe! fear God, and believe in His Apostle: He will give you two portions of His mercy, and will make for you a light for you to walk in, and will forgive you; for God is forgiving, compassionate
That the people of the Book may know that they cannot control aught of God's grace; and that grace is in God's hands, He gives it to whom He will; for God is Lord of mighty grace
GOD has heard the speech of her who wrangled with you about her husband, and complained to God; and God hears your gossip; verily, God both hears and sees
Those among you who back out of their wives they are not their mothers: their mothers are only those who gave them birth; and, verily, they speak a wrong speech and a false. Verily, God both pardons and forgives
But those who back out of their wives and then would recall their speech,- then the manumission of a captive before they touch each other; that is what ye are admonished, and God of what ye do is well aware
But he who finds not (the means):- then a fast for two months consecutively, before they touch each other; and he who cannot endure that:- then the feeding of sixty poor folk. That is that ye may believe in God and His Apostle; and these are the bounds of God; and for the misbelievers is grievous woe
Verily, those who oppose God and His Apostle shall be upset, as those before them were upset. We have sent down manifest signs: for the misbelievers is shameful woe
on the day when God shall raise them all together, and shall inform them of what they have done. God has taken account of it, but they forget it; for God is witness over all
Dost thou not see that God knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth? and that there cannot be a privy discourse of three but He makes the fourth? nor of five but He makes the sixth? nor less than that nor more, but that He is with them wheresoe'er they be? then He will inform them of what they have done upon the resurrection day; verily, God all things doth know
Dost thou not look at those who were prohibited from privy talk, and then returned to that they were forbidden? and they too discourse together with sin and enmity and rebellion against the Apostle; and when they come to thee they greet thee with what God greets thee not; and they say in themselves, Why does not God torment us for what we say? Hell is enough for them! they shall broil therein, and an ill journey shall it be
O ye who believe! when ye discourse together, then discourse not in sin and enmity and rebellion against the Apostle; but discourse together in righteousness and piety: and fear God, for unto Him ye shall be gathered
Privy talk is only from the devil, and those who do believe may grieve: it cannot hurt them at all, except by the permission of God: and upon God let the believers rely
O ye who believe! when it is said to you, 'Make room in your assemblies,' then make room; God will make room for you; and when it is said to you, 'Rise up,' then rise up; God will raise all you who believe, as well as those who are given knowledge, in rank; for God of what ye do is well aware
O ye who believe! when ye address the Apostle, then give in charity before addressing him; that is better for you, and more pure. But if ye find not the means,- then God is forgiving, compassionate
What! do ye shrink from giving in charity before addressing him? then if ye do it not, and God relents towards you, then be steadfast in prayer, and give alms, and fear God and His Apostle; for God is well aware of what ye do
Dost thou not look at those who take for patrons a people God is wrath with? they are neither of you nor of them, and they swear to you a lie the while they know
for them God has prepared severe torment; verily, evil is it they have done
They take their faith for a cloak; and they turn men aside from the path of God; and for them is shameful woe
Their wealth shall not avail them, nor their children at all, against God; they are the fellows of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein for aye
On the day when God raises them all together, then will they swear to Him as they swore to you; and they will think that they rest on somewhat.- Ay, verily, they are liars
Satan hath overridden them, and made them forget the remembrance of God: they are the crew of Satan; ay, the crew of Satan, they are the losers
Verily, those who oppose God and His Apostle are amongst the most vile
God has written, 'I will surely prevail, I and my apostles;' verily, God is strong and mighty
Thou shalt not find a people who believe in God and the last day loving him who opposes God and His Apostle, even though it be their fathers, or their sons, or their brethren, or their clansmen. He has written faith in their hearts, and He aids them with a spirit from Him; and will make them enter into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye! God is well pleased with them, and they well pleased with Him: they are God's crew; ay, God's crew, they shall prosper
What is in the heavens and in the earth celebrates God's praises; He is the mighty, the wise
He it was who drove those of the people of the Book who misbelieved forth from their houses, at the first emigration; ye did not think that they would go forth, and they thought that their fortresses would defend them against God; but God came upon them from whence they did not reckon, and cast dread into their hearts! They ruined their houses with their own hands and the hands of the believers; wherefore take example, O ye who are endowed with sight
Had it not been that God had prescribed for them banishment, He would have tormented them in this world; but for them in the next shall be the torment of the Fire
that is because they opposed God and His Apostle: and whoso opposes God, verily, God is keen to punish
What palm trees ye did cut down or what ye left standing upon their roots was by God's permission, and to disgrace the workers of abomination
and as for the spoils that God gave to His Apostle from these (people) ye did not press forward after them with horse or riding camel; but God gives His Apostle authority over whom He pleases, for God is mighty over all
What God gave as spoils to His Apostle of the people of the cities is God's, and the Apostle's, and for kinsfolk, orphans, and the poor, and the wayfarer, so that it should not be circulated amongst the rich men of you. And what the Apostle gives you, take; and what he forbids you, desist from; and fear God, verily, God is keen to punish
And (it is) for the poor who fled, who were driven forth from their houses and their wealth, who crave grace from God and His goodwill, and help God and the Apostle; they are the truthful
And those who were settled in the abode and the faith before them, love those who fled to them; and they do not find in their breasts a need of what has been given to them; preferring them to themselves, even though there be poverty amongst them; and whoso is preserved from his own covetousness, these are the prosperous
And those who came after them say, 'Our Lord, forgive us and our brethren who were beforehand with us in the faith, and place not in our hearts ill-will towards those who believe - our Lord! verily, thou art kind, compassionate
Dost thou not look on those who were hypocritical, saying to their brethren who misbelieved amongst the people of the Book, 'If ye be driven forth we will go forth with you; and we will never obey any one concerning you; and if ye be fought against we will help you.' But God bears witness that they are surely liars
If they be driven forth, these will not go forth with them; and if they be fought against, these will not help them; or if they do help them, they will turn their backs in flight;- then shall they not be helped
Ye indeed are a keener source of fear in their hearts than God; that is because they are a people who do not understand
They will not fight against you in a body save in fortified cities, or from behind walls; their valour is great amongst themselves;- thou dost reckon them as one body, but their hearts are separated. This is because they are a people who have no sense
Like unto those before them, recently they tasted the evil result of their affair, and for them is grievous woe
Like unto the devil when he said to man, 'Disbelieve.' But when he disbelieved, he said, 'Verily, I am clear of thee! Verily, I fear God the Lord of the worlds
And the end of them both shall be that they shall both be in the Fire, to dwell therein for aye! for that is the reward of the unjust
O ye who believe! fear God; and let each soul look to what it sends on for the morrow; and fear God; verily, God is well aware of what ye do
And be ye not like those who forget God, and He makes them forget themselves; they are the workers of abomination
Not deemed alike shall be the fellows of the Fire and the fellows of Paradise: the fellows of Paradise they are the blissful
Had we sent down this Qur'an upon a mountain, thou wouldst have seen it humbling itself, splitting asunder from the fear of God! These parables do we strike out for men; haply they may reflect
He is God than whom there is no god; who knows the unseen and the visible; He is the merciful, the compassionate
He is God than whom there is no god; the King, the Holy, the Peace-Giver, the Faithful, the Protector, the Mighty, the Repairer, the Great!- celebrated be the praises of God above what they join with Him
He is God, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner; His are the excellent names! His praises whatever are in the heavens and the earth do celebrate; for God is the mighty, the wise
O ye who believe! take not my enemy and your enemy for patrons, encountering them with love for they misbelieve in the truth that is to come to you; they drive out the Apostle and you for that ye believe in God your Lord! If ye go forth fighting strenuously in my cause and craving my good pleasure, and secretly show love for them, yet do I know best what ye conceal and what ye display! and he of you who does so has erred from the level path
If they find you they will be enemies to you, and they will stretch forth against you their hands and their tongues for evil, and would fain that ye should disbelieve

Verily, with us are heavy fetters and hell-fire
and food that chokes, and mighty woe
On the day when the earth and the mountains shall tremble and the earth shall be as a crumbling sand-hill
Verily, we have sent unto you an apostle bearing witness against you, as we sent an apostle unto Pharaoh
But Pharaoh rebelled against the apostle, and we seized him with an overpowering punishment
Then how will ye shield yourselves if ye misbelieve from the day which shall make children grey-headed
whereon the heaven cleaves - its promise shall be fulfilled
Verily, this is a memorial, and whoso will, let him take unto his Lord a way
Verily, thy Lord knows that thou dost stand up to pray nearly two-thirds of the night, or the half of it or the third of it, as do part of those who are with thee; for God measures the night and the day; He knows that ye cannot calculate it, and He turns relentant towards you. So read what is easy of the Qur'an. He knows that there will be of you some who are sick and others who beat about in the earth craving the grace of God, and others who are fighting in the cause of God. Then read what is easy of it and be steadfast in prayer, and give alms, and lend to God a goodly loan, for what ye send forward for yourselves of good ye will find it with God. It is better and a greater hire; and ask ye pardon of God: verily, God is forgiving, merciful
O thou who art covered
rise up and warn
And thy Lord magnify
And thy garments purify
And abomination shun
And grant not favours to gain increase
And for thy Lord await
And when the trump is blown
for that day is a difficult day
for the misbelievers aught but easy
Leave me alone with him I have created
and for whom I have made extensive wealth
and sons that he may look upon
and for whom I have smoothed things down
Then he desires that I should increase
nay, verily, he is hostile to our signs
I will drive him up a hill
Then he reflected and planned
May he be killed, - how he planned
Again, may he be killed, - how he planned
Then he looked
then he frowned and scowled
then he retreated and was big with pride
and said, 'This is only magic exhibited
this is only mortal speech
I will broil him in hell-fire
and what shall make thee know what hell-fire is
It will not leave and will not let alone
It scorches the flesh
over it are nineteen (angels)
We have made only angels guardians of the fire, and we have only made their number a trial to those who misbelieve; that those who have been given the Book may be certain, and that those who believe may be increased in faith; and that those who have been given the Book and the believers may not doubt; and that those in whose hearts is sickness, and the misbelievers may say, 'What does God mean by this as a parable?' Thus God leads astray whom He pleases, and guides him He pleases: and none knows the hosts of thy Lord save Himself; and it is only a reminder to mortals
Nay, by the moon
And the night when it retires
And the morning when it brightly dawns
Verily, it is one of the greatest misfortunes
a warning to mortals
for him amongst you who wishes to press forward or to tarry
Every soul is pledged for what it earns
except the fellows of the right
in gardens shall they ask each other
about the sinners
What drove you into hell-fire
They shall say, 'We weren't of those who prayed
we didn't feed the poor
but we did plunge into discussion with those who plunged
and we called the judgment day a lie
until the certainty did come to us
But there shall not profit them the intercession of the intercessors
What ailed them that they turned away from the memorial
as though they were timid asses
fleeing from a lion
Nay, every man of them wished that he might have given him books spread open
Nay, but they did not fear the hereafter
Nay, it is a memorial
and let him who will remember it
but none will remember it except God please. He is most worthy of fear; and he is most worthy to forgive
I need not swear by the resurrection day
Nor need I swear by the self-accusing soul
Does man think that we shall not collect his bones
Able are we to arrange his finger tips
Nay, but man wishes to be wicked henceforward
he asks, When is the resurrection day
But when the sight shall be dazed
and the moon be eclipsed
and the sun and the moon be together
and man shall say upon that day, 'Where is a place to flee to
nay, no refuge
and to thy Lord that day is the sure settlement
He will inform man on that day of what He has sent forward or delayed
Nay, man is an evidence against himself
and even if he thrusts forward his excuses
Do not move thy tongue thereby to hasten it
It is for us to collect it and to read it
and when we read it then follow its reading
And again it is for us to explain it
Nay, indeed, but ye love the transient life
and ye neglect the hereafter
Faces on that day shall be bright
gazing on their Lord
And faces on that day shall be dismal
Thou wilt think that a back-breaking calamity has happened to them
Nay, but when the [soul] comes up into the throat
and it is said, 'Who will charm it back
and he will think that it is his parting [hour]
And leg shall be pressed on leg
unto thy Lord on that day shall the driving be
For he did not believes and did not pray
but he said it was a lie, and turned his back
Then he went to his people haughtily
woe to thee, and woe to thee
again woe to thee, and woe to thee
Does man think that he shall be left to himself
Wasn't he a clot of emitted seed
Then he was congealed blood, and (God) created him, and fashioned him
and made of him pairs, male and female
Is not He able to quicken the dead
Does there not come on man a portion of time when he is nothing worth mentioning
Verily, We created man from a mingled clot, to try him; and we gave him hearing and sight
Verily, we guided him in the way, whether he be grateful or ungrateful
Verily, we have prepared for those who misbelieve chains and fetters and a blaze
Verily, the righteous shall drink of a cup tempered with Kafur
a spring from which God's servants shall drink and make it gush out as they please
They who fulfill their vows, and fear a day, the evil which shall fly abroad
and who give food for His love to the poor and the orphan and the captive
We only feed you for God's sake; we desire not from you either reward or thanks
we fear from our Lord a frowning, calamitous day
And God will guard them from the evil of that day and will cast on them brightness and joy
and their reward for their patience shall be Paradise and silk
reclining therein upon couches they shall neither see therein sun nor piercing cold
and close down upon them shall be its shadows; and lowered over them its fruits to cull
and they shall be served round with vessels of silver and goblets that are as flagons
flagons of silver which they shall mete out
and they shall drink therein a cup tempered with Zingabil
a spring therein named Silsabil
and there shall go round about them eternal boys; when thou seest them thou wilt think them scattered pearls
and when thou seest them thou shalt see pleasure and a great estate
On them shall be garments of green embroidered satin and brocade; and they shall be adorned with bracelets of silver; and their Lord shall give them to drink pure drink
Verily, this is a reward for you, and your efforts are thanked
Verily, we have sent down upon thee the Qur'an
Wherefore wait patiently for the judgment of thy Lord, and obey not any sinner or misbeliever amongst them
But remember the name of thy Lord morning, and evening
and through the night, and adore Him, and celebrate His praises the whole night long
Verily, these love the transitory life, and leave behind them a heavy day
We created them and strengthened their joints; and if we please we can exchange for the likes of them in their stead
Verily, this is a memorial, and whoso will, let him take unto his Lord a way
But ye will not please except God please! Verily, God is knowing, wise
He makes whomsoever He pleases to enter into His mercy; but the unjust He has prepared for them a grievous woe
By those sent in a series
And by those who speed swiftly
And by the dispensers abroad
And by the separators apart
And by those who instil the reminder
as an excuse or warning
Verily, what ye are threatened with shall surely happen
And when the stars shall be erased
And when the heaven shall be cleft
And when the mountains shall be winnowed
And when the apostles shall have a time appointed for them
For what day is the appointment made
For the day of decision
and what shall make thee know what the decision is
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
Have we not destroyed those of yore
and then followed them up with those of the latter day
Thus do we with the sinners
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
Did we not create you from contemptible water
and place it in a sure depository
unto a certain decreed term
for we are able and well able too
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
Have we not made for them the earth
to hold the living and the dead
and set thereon firm mountains reared aloft? and given you to drink water in streams
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
Go off to that which ye did call a lie
Go off to the shadow of three columns
that shall not shade nor avail against the flame
Verily, it throws off sparks like towers
as though they were yellow camels
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
This is the day when they may not speak
when they are not permitted to excuse themselves
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
This is the day of decision! We have assembled you with those of yore
if ye have any stratagem employ it now
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
Verily, the pious are amid shades and springs
and fruit such as they love
Eat and drink with good digestion, for that which ye have done
Verily, thus do we reward those who do well
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little; verily, ye are sinners
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
And when it is said to them bow down, they bow not down
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
And in what new discourse after it will they believe
Of what do they ask each other
Of the mighty information
whereon they do dispute
nay, they shall know too well
Again, nay, they shall know too well
Have we not set the earth as a couch
and the mountains as stakes
and created you in pairs
and made your sleep for rest
and made the night a garment
and made the day for livelihood
and built above you seven solid (heavens)
and set a burning lamp
and, sent down from the rain-expressing clouds water pouring forth
to bring out thereby the grain and herb
and gardens thickly planted
Verily, the day of decision is an appointed time
and the day when the trumpet shall be blown, and ye shall come in troops
and the heavens shall be opened, and shall be all doors
and the mountains shall be moved, and shall be like a mirage
Verily, hell is an ambuscade
a reward for the outrageous
to tarry therein for ages
They shall not taste therein cool nor drink
but only boiling water and pus
a fit reward
Verily, they did not hope for the account
but they ever said our signs were lies
Everything have we remembered in a book
Then taste, for we will only increase your torment
Verily, for the pious is a blissful place
gardens and vineyards
and girls with swelling breasts of the same age as themselves
and a brimming cup
they shall hear therein no folly and no lie
a reward from thy Lord, a sufficient gift
The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and what is between them both,- the Merciful,- they cannot obtain audience of Him
The day when the Spirit and the angels shall stand in ranks, they shall not speak save to whom the Merciful permits, and who speaks aright
That is the true day; and whoso pleases let him take to a resort unto his Lord
Verily, we have warned you of a torment that is nigh: on a day when man shall see what his two hands have sent forward; and the misbeliever shall say, 'Would that I were dust
By those who tear out violently
And by those who gaily release
And by those who float through the air
And the preceders who precede
And those who manage the affair
On the day when the quaking quakes
which the following one shall succeed
Hearts on that day shall tremble
eyes thereon be humbled
They say, 'Shall we be sent back to our old course
What! when we are rotten bones
they say, 'That then were a losing return
But it will only be one scare
and lo! they will be on the surface
Has the story of Moses come to you
when his Lord addressed him in the holy valley of Tuva
Go unto Pharaoh, verily, he is outrageous
and say, "Hast thou a wish to purify thyself
and that I may guide thee to thy Lord, and thou mayest fear
So he showed him the greatest signs
but he called him a liar and rebelled
Then he retreated hastily
and gathered, and proclaimed
and said, 'I am your Lord most High
but God seized him with the punishment of the future life and of the former
Verily, in that is a lesson to him who fears
Are ye harder to create or the heaven that He has built
He raised its height and fashioned it
and made its night to cover it, and brought forth its noonday light
and the earth after that He did stretch out
He brings forth from it its water and its pasture
And the mountains He did firmly set
a provision for you and for your cattle
And when the great predominant calamity shall come
on the day when man shall remember what he strove after
and hell shall be brought out for him who sees
And as for him who was outrageous
and preferred the life of this world
verily, hell is the resort
But as for him who feared the station of his Lord, and prohibited his soul from lust
verily, Paradise is the resort
They shall ask thee about the Hour, for when it is set
Whereby canst thou mention it
Unto thy Lord its period belongs
Thou art only a warner to him who fears it
On the day they see it, it will be as though they had only tarried an evening or the noon thereof
He frowned and turned his back
for that there came to him a blind man
But what should make thee know whether haply he may be purified
or may be mindful and the reminder profit him
But as for him who is wealthy
thou dost attend to him
and thou dost not care that he is not purified
but as for him who comes to thee earnestly
fearing the while
from him thou art diverted
Nay! verily, it is a memorial
and whoso pleases will remember it
In honoured pages
exalted, purified
in the hands of
noble, righteous scribes
May man be killed! how ungrateful he is
Of what did He create him
Of a clot. He created him and fated him
then the path He did make easy for him
then He killed him, and laid him in the tomb
then when He pleases will He raise him up again
Nay, he has not fulfilled his bidding
But let man look unto his foods
Verily, we have poured the water out in torrents
then we have cleft the earth asunder
and made to grow therefrom the grain
and the grape, and the hay
and the olive, and the palm
and gardens closely planted
and fruits, and grass
a provision for you and for your cattle
But when the stunning noise shall come
on the day when man shall flee from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his spouse and his sons
Every man among them on that day shall have a business to employ him
Faces on that day shall be bright
laughing, joyous
and faces shall have dust upon them
darkness shall cover them
those are the wicked misbelievers
When the sun is folded up
And when the stars do fall
And when the mountains are moved
And when the she-camels ten months gone with young shall be neglected
And when the beasts shall be crowded together
And when the seas shall surge up
And when souls shall be paired with bodies
And when the child who was buried alive shall be asked
for what sin she was slain
And when the pages shall be spread out
And when the heaven shall be flayed
And when hell shall be set ablaze
And when Paradise shall be brought nigh
The soul shall know what it has produced
I need not swear by the stars that slink back
moving swiftly, slinking into their dens
Nor by the night when darkness draws on
Nor by the morn when it first breathes up
Verily, it is the speech of a noble apostle
mighty, standing sure with the Lord of the throne
obeyed and trusty too
Your comrade is not mad
he saw him on the plain horizon
nor does he grudge to communicate the unseen
Nor is it the speech of a pelted devil
Then whither do ye go
It is but a reminder to the worlds
to whomsoever of you pleases to go straight
but ye will not please, except God, the Lord of the world, should please
When the heaven is cleft asunder
And when the stars are scattered
And when the seas gush together
And when the tombs are turned upside down
The soul shall know what it has sent on or kept back
O man! what has seduced thee concerning thy generous Lord
who created thee, and fashioned thee, and gave thee symmetry
and in what form He pleased composed thee
Nay, but ye call the judgment a lie
but over you are guardians set
noble, writing down
they know what ye do
Verily, the righteous are in pleasure
and, verily, the wicked are in hell
they shall broil therein upon the judgment day
nor shall they be absent therefrom
And what shall make thee know what is the judgment day
Again, what shall make thee know what is the judgment day
a day when no soul shall control aught for another; and the bidding on that day belongs to God
Woe to those who give short weight
who when they measure against others take full measure
but when they measure to them or weigh to them, diminish
Do not these think that they shall be raised again
at the mighty day
the day when men shall stand before the Lord of the worlds
Nay, verily, the book of the wicked is in Siggin
and what shall make thee know what Siggin is
a book inscribed
Woe on that day for those who say it is a lie
Who call the judgment day a lie
but none shall call it a lie except every sinful transgressor
who, when our signs are read to him, says, Old folks tales
Nay, but that which they have gained has settled upon their hearts
Nay, verily, from their Lord on that day are they veiled
and then, verily, they shall broil in hell
then it shall be said, 'This is what ye once did call a lie
Nay, verily, the book of the righteous is in Illiyun
and what shall make thee know what Illiyun is
book inscribed
those nigh to God shall witness it
Verily, the righteous shall be in pleasure
upon couches shall they gaze
thou mayest recognise in their faces the brightness of pleasure
they shall be given to drink wine that is sealed
whose seal is musk; for that then let the aspirants aspire
and it shall be tempered with Tasnim
a spring from which those nigh to God shall drink
Verily, those who sin do laugh at those who believe
and when they pass by they wink at one another
and when they return to their family they return ridiculing them
and when they see them they say, Verily, these do go astray
but they are not sent as guardians over them
But today those who believe shall at the misbelievers laugh
Upon couches shall they gaze
are the misbelievers rewarded for what they have done
When the heaven is rent asunder
and gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful
And when the earth is stretched out
and casts forth what is in it, and is empty
and gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful
O man! verily, thou are toiling after thy Lord, toiling; wherefore shalt thou meet Him
And as for him who is given his book in his right hand
he shall be reckoned with by an easy reckoning
and he shall go back to his family joyfully
But as for him who is given his book behind his back
he shall call out for destruction
but he shall broil in a blaze
Verily, he was amongst his family joyful
Verily, he thought that he should never return to God
Yea, verily, his Lord on him did look
I need not swear by the evening glow
Or by the night, and what it drives together
Or by the moon when it is at its full
Ye shall be surely transferred from state to state
What ails them that they do not believe
and, when the Koran is read to them, do not adore
Nay, those who misbelieve do say it is a lie
but God knows best the (malice) that they hide
So give them the glad tidings of grievous woe
save those who believe and act aright, for them is hire that is not grudged
By the heaven with its zodiacal signs
And the promised day
And the witness and the witnessed
The fellows of the pit were slain
And the fire with its kindling
When they sat over it
And witnessed the while what they were doing with those who believed
And they took not vengeance on them save for their belief in God, The mighty, the praiseworthy
Whose is the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth; For God is witness over all
Verily, those who make trial of the believers, men and women, and then do not repent, for them is the torment of hell, and for them is the torment of the burning
Verily, those who believe and act aright, for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow,- that is the great bliss
Verily, the violence of thy Lord is keen
Verily, He produces and returns
and He is the forgiving, the loving
the Lord of the glorious throne
the doer of what He will
Has there come to thee the story of the hosts
of Pharaoh and Thamud
Nay, those who misbelieve do say it is a lie
but God is behind them - encompassing
Nay, it is a glorious Koran
in a preserved tablet
By the heaven and by the night star
And what shall make thee know what the night star is
The star of piercing brightness
Verily, every soul has a guardian over it
Then let man look from what he is created
he is created from water poured forth
that comes out from between the loins and the breast bones
Verily, He is able to send him back again
on the day when the secrets shall be tried
and he shall have no strength nor helper
By the heaven that sends back the rain
And the earth with its sprouting
Verily, it is indeed a distinguishing speech
and it is no frivolity
Verily, they do plot a plot
But I plot my plot too
let the misbelievers bide; do thou then let them bide awhile
Celebrated the name of thy Lord most High
who created and fashioned
and who decreed and guided
and who brings forth the pasture
and then makes it dusky stubble
We will make thee recite, and thou shalt not forget
save what God pleases. Verily, He knows the open and what is concealed
and we will send thee easily to ease
wherefore remind, for, verily, the reminder is useful
But he who fears will be mindful
but the wretch will avoid it
he who will broil on the great fire
and then therein shall neither die nor live
Prosperous is he who purifies himself
and remembers the name of his Lord and prays
Nay! but ye prefer the life of this world
while the hereafter is better and more lasting
Verily, this was in the books of yore
the books of Abraham and Moses
Has there come to thee the story of the overwhelming
Faces on that day shall be humble
labouring, toiling
shall broil upon a burning fire
shall be given to drink from a boiling spring
no food shall they have save from the foul thorn
which shall not fatten nor avail against hunger
Faces on that day shall be comfortable
content with their past endeavours
in a lofty garden
wherein they shall hear no foolish word
wherein is a flowing fountain
wherein are couches raised on high
and goblets set down
and cushions arranged
and carpets spread
Do they not look then at the camel how she is created
And at the heaven how it is reared
And at the mountains how they are set up
And at the earth how it is spread out
But remind: thou art only one to remind
thou art not in authority over them
except such as turns his back and misbelieves
for him will God torment with the greatest torment
Verily, unto us is their return
and, verily, for us is their account
By the dawn
and ten nights
And the single and the double
And the night when it travels on
Is there in that an oath for a man of sense
Hast thou not seen how thy Lord did with Ad
with Iram of the columns
the like of which has not been created in the land
And Thamud when they hewed the stones in the valley
And Pharaoh of the stakes
Who were outrageous in the land
and did multiply wickedness therein
and thy Lord poured out upon them the scourge of torment
Verily, thy Lord is on a watch tower
and as for man, whenever his Lord tries him and honours him and grants him favour, then he says, My Lord has honoured me
but whenever he tries him and doles out to him his subsistence, then he says, My Lord despises me
Nay, but ye do not honour the orphan
nor do ye urge each other to feed the poor
and ye devour the inheritance (of the weak) with a general devouring
and ye love wealth with a complete love
Nay, when the earth is crushed to pieces
and thy Lord comes with the angels, rank on rank
and hell is brought on that day,- on that day shall man be reminded! but how shall he have a reminder
He will say, 'Would that I had sent something forward for my life
But on that day no one shall be tormented with a torment like his
and none shall be bound with bonds like his
O thou comforted soul
return unto thy Lord, well pleased and well pleased with
And enter amongst my servants
and enter my Paradise
I need not swear by the Lord of this land
and though a dweller in this land
Nor by the begetter and what he begets
We have surely created man in trouble
Does he think that none can do aught against him
He says, I have wasted wealth in plenty
does he think that no one sees him
Have we not made for him two eyes
and a tongue, and two lips
and guided him in the two highways
but he will not attempt the steep
And what shall make thee know what the steep is
It is freeing captives
or feeding on the day of famine
an orphan who is akin
or a poor man who lies in the dust
and again (it is) to be of these who believe and encourage each other to patience, and encourage each other to mercy
these are the fellows of the right
But those who disbelieve in our signs, they are the fellows of the left
for them is fire that closes in
By the sun and its noonday brightness
And the moon when it follows him
And the day when it displays him
And the night when it covers him
And the heaven and what built it
And the earth and what spread it
And the soul and what fashioned it, and taught it
its sin and its piety
Prosperous is he who purifies it
And disappointed is he who corrupts it
Thamud called the apostle a liar in their outrage
when their wretch rose up
and the apostle of God said to them, God's she-camel! so give her to drink
But they called him a liar, and they ham-strung her; but their Lord destroyed them in their sins, and served them all alike
and He fears not the result thereof
By the night when it veils
And the day when it is displayed
And by what created male and female
Verily, your efforts are diverse
But as for him who gives alms and fears God
And believes in the best
We will send him easily to ease
But as for him who is niggardly, And longs for wealth
And calls the good a lie
We will send him easily to difficulty
And his wealth shall not avail him When he falls down (into hell)
Verily, it is for us to guide
And, verily, ours are the hereafter and the former life
And I have warned you of a fire that flames
None shall broil thereon, but the most wretched
who says it is a lie and turns his back
But the pious shall be kept away from it
he who gives his wealth in alms
and who gives no favour to any one for the sake of reward
but only craving the face of his Lord most High
in the end he shall be well pleased
By the forenoon
And the night when it darkens
Thy Lord has not forsaken thee, nor hated thee
and surely the hereafter is better for thee than the former
and in the end thy Lord will give thee, and thou shalt be well pleased
Did He not find thee an orphan, and give the shelter
and find thee erring, and guide thee
and find thee poor with a family, and nourish thee
But as for the orphan oppress him not
and as for the beggar drive him not away
and as for the favour of thy Lord discourse thereof
Have we not expanded for thee thy breast
and set down from thee thy load
which galled thy back
and exalted for thee thy renown
Verily, with difficulty is ease
verily, with difficulty is ease
And when thou art at leisure then toil
and for thy Lord do thou yearn
By the fig! And by the olive
And by Mount Sinai
And by this safe land
We have indeed created man in the best of symmetry
Then we will send him back the lowest of the low
save those who believe and act aright; for theirs is a hire that is not grudged
But what shall make thee call the judgment after this a lie
Is not God a most just of judges
READ, in the name of thy Lord
Who created man from congealed blood
Read, for thy Lord is most generous
Who taught the pen
Taught man what he did not know
Nay, verily, man is indeed outrageous
at seeing himself get rich
Verily, unto thy Lord is the return
Hast thou considered him who forbids
a servant when he prays
Hast thou considered if he were in guidance
or bade piety
Hast thou considered if he said it was a lie, and turned his back
Did he not know that God can see
Nay, surely, if he do not desist we will drag him by the forelock
the lying sinful forelock
So let him call his counsel
we will call the guards of hell
Nay, obey him not, but adore and draw nigh
Verily, we sent it down on the Night of Power
And what shall make thee know what the Night of Power is
the Night of Power is better than a thousand months
The angels and the Spirit descend therein, by the permission of their Lord with every bidding
Peace it is until rising of the dawn
Those of the people of the Book and the idolaters who misbelieve did not fall off until there came to them the manifest sign
An apostle from God reading pure pages
wherein are right scriptures
Nor did those who were given the Book divide into sects until after there came to them the manifest sign
But they were not bidden aught but to worship God, being sincere in religion unto Him as Hanifs, and to be steadfast in prayer, and to give alms: for that is the standard religion
Verily, those who disbelieve amongst the people of the Book and the idolaters shall be in the fire of hell, to dwell therein for aye; they are wretched creatures
Verily, those who believe and act aright, they are the best of creatures
their reward with their Lord is gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; God shall be well pleased with them, and they with Him! that is for him who fears his Lord
When the earth shall quake with its quaking
And the earth shall bring forth her burdens
and man shall say, What ails her
On that day she shall tell her tidings
because thy Lord inspires her
On the day when men shall come up in separate bands to show their works
and he who does the weight of an atom of good shall see it
and he who does the weight of an atom of evil shall see it
By the snorting chargers
And those who strike fire with their hoofs
And those who make incursions in the morning
And raise up dust therein
And cleave through a host therein
Verily, man is to his Lord ungrateful
and, verily, he is a witness of that
Verily, he is keen in his love of good
Does he not know when the tombs are exposed
and what is in the breasts is brought to light
Verily, thy Lord upon that day indeed is well aware
The smiting
What is the smiting
And what shall make thee know what the smiting is
The day when men shall be like scattered moths
and the mountains shall be like flocks of carded wool
And as for him whose balance is heavy
he shall be in a well-pleasing life
But as for him whose balance is light
his dwelling shall be the pit of hell
And who shall make thee know what it is
a burning fire
The contention about numbers deludes you
till ye visit the tombs
Not so! In the end ye shall know
And again not so! In the end ye shall know
Not so! Did ye but know with certain knowledge
Ye shall surely see hell
And again ye shall surely see it with an eye of certainty
Then ye shall surely be asked about pleasure
By the afternoon
verily, man is in loss
save those who believe and do right, and bid each other be true, and bid each other be patient
Woe to every slanderous backbiter
who collects wealth and counts it
He thinks that his wealth can immortalize him
Not so! he shall be hurled into ElHutamah
And what shall make thee understand what ElHutamah is
the fire of God kindled
which rises above the hearts
Verily, it is an archway over them
on long-drawn columns
Hast thou not seen what thy Lord did with the fellows of the elephant
Did He not make their stratagem lead them astray
and send down on them birds in flocks
to throw down on them stones of baked clay
and make them like blades of herbage eaten down
For the uniting of the Qurais
uniting them for the caravan of winter and summer
So let them serve the Lord of this house
who feeds them against hunger and makes them safe against fear
Hast thou considered him who calls the judgment a lie
He it is who pushes the orphan away
and urges not (others) to feed the poor
But woe to those who pray
and who are careless in their prayers
Who pretend
and withhold necessaries
Verily, we have given thee El Kauthar
So pray to thy Lord and slaughter (victims)
Verily, he who hates thee shall be childless
Say, O ye misbelievers
I do not serve what ye serve
nor will ye serve what I serve
nor will I serve what ye serve
nor will ye serve what I serve
ye have your religion, and I have my religion
When there comes God's help and victory
And thou shalt see men enter into God's religion by troops
Then celebrate the praises of thy Lord, and ask forgiveness of Him, verily, He is relentant
Abu Lahebs two hands shall perish, and he shall perish
His wealth shall not avail him, nor what he has earned
He shall broil in a fire that flames
and his wife carrying faggots
on her neck a cord of palm fibres
Say, He is God alone
God the Eternal
He begets not and is not begotten
Nor is there like unto Him any one
Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak
from the evil of what He has created
and from the evil of the night when it cometh on
and from the evil of the blowers upon knots
and from the evil of the envious when he envies
Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of men
the King of men
the God of men
from the evil of the whisperer, who slinks off
who whispers into the hearts of men
from ginns and men
