In the Name of Allah, Al-Rahman (Beneficent) and Al-Rahim (Merciful)
Hearts surge forth and answer thanks to Allah, Creator of the universe, for whom all His glorious attributes are extolled and praised
Al-Rahman, AL-Rahim
Malik Yawm al-Din (The Absolute Soveriegn Who has sole authority over of Day of Judgement)
It is You and You alone Whom we worship, it is You and You alone Whom we invoke for guidance and help
Guide us, O Allah, to the path of righteousness
The path where those You guided were covered and protected by Your gracious wing, not the path of those who came within the measure of Your wrath, nor the path of those lost in a maze
(Alef) L. (Lam) M. (Meem). The Surah opens with letters from the Arabic alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran, though written in the people's tongue cannot be emulated
This Book -the Quran- in which Providence is the Guide, occasions no, doubt and represents the spirit of truth guiding into all truth; it guides those: who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
Who are strongly disposed to realise the unseen, especially Allah, Who is exposed only to mental view, perceived only by the mind, Who recognise His spiritual beings, His attendants and His messengers, and they sense with prudence the Hereafter, Who duly engage in worship and spend in benevolence and benefaction of the provisions of life We provisioned them
Who faithfully believe in all that has been revealed to you, O Muhammad, -the Quran- way of life, religious and spiritual virtues and all that has been enjoined, crediting all revelations to those sent before you in Al-Tawrah (the Torah) and Al-Injil (the Bible) and the like, affirming the certainty of the Hereafter
Their hearts have been touched with the divine hand, they have Providence as their guide, and it is they who will prosper
As to those who deny Allah, not lifting to Him their inward sight, it is all the same to them whether you warn them O Muhammad of menacing danger and misfortune or not
Allah has closed their hearts’ ears and denied them intellectual sense of hearing, and their minds' eyes grow dim as if covered with a film; they are disposed to denseness of intellect and shall suffer a fitting punishment
Among people are those who pretend to believe in Allah, give credence to His Omnipotence and Authority and acknowledge the truth of the Hereafter while in fact they hug their old irreverent conviction to their hearts
They apply their minds to deceiving Allah, AL-'Alim (the Omniscient), Who knows what is secretly suggested to the mind, and to deceive those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, when in fact, they only deceive themselves, failing to perceive
Their ill-natured hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being, and consequently did Allah make their seats of intellect melt away in disease and lassitude that they addicted themselves to vice, and there awaits them a fitting punishment for their intentional assertion of what is false
And when told to stop making mischief on earth nor create discord, they say: "But we only try to bring people to abandon the wrong course of life and conduct and adopt the right one till the new principle governs their thoughts
Indeed, the reform they claim is nothing but a euphemism for ruin, they are composed more of mischief than ill-will, but they fail to perceive
And when told to conform their will to Allah’s will and to recognise Him, believe in Him and give credence to His Omnipotence and Authority as other people have conformed to His will, they say: "Shall we demean ourselves like the simpletons did and follow the same course they followed?" Indeed, they are the fools who said in their hearts, "There is no god," but they are ignorant and unknowing of the truth
And when they are face to face with those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues they declare that they have conformed their will to Allah’s will, and when they are apart with their satanic confederates who delight in satanic wickedness, they assure them of their confederacy and that they confederate in their design but they were only laughing at the believers with an outward contempt of what they esteemed sacred
Allah gives them plenty of rope to allow them free scope and action in order to commit themselves to the loss in a maze of error
These are they who have been steered by false belief and exchanged the guidance of Providence to the path of righteousness for a perplexed path in a maze of error, and in consequence their embarking in bad business and their captivation in evil trade have caused them the loss of their souls, they were captive victors who lost in gain, nor could they hit the path of righteousness
Their example stands similitude exact of someone who has kindled a fire togive light to a body of companions and when the surroundings glowed with light, Allah extinguished their fire and their alacrity and quenched their light and cut them off illumination and enlightenment and left them in want of physical, spiritual and intellectual sight
Deaf and dumb, insensible to light, they are unable to retrace their steps that lead them into error
Their example stands similitude exact of a people who are overshadowed with dark thunder cloud floating in the floor of the vault of heaven and sends forth thunder and lightning, terrifying and startling, and they think that by plugging their ears with their finger tips to make them impervious to sound they would avert death, but Allah besets and bounds those who deny Him on all sides
Lightning very nearly snatches their sense of sight; as often as it emits for them gleams they proceed under its light and when it darkens, their eyes shrivel into darkness in their heads and they stand dead; and had Allah willed He would have deprived them of their sense of hearing and that of sight, faculties divine; He is indeed Qadirun (Omnipotent) to effect all things
O you people worship Allah, your Creator, and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; it is He Who brought you into being and caused you and caused all those who preceded you to exist. This may help you lift to Him your inward sight and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
It is He Who set for you the earth at creation in the order of a settled habitation where you establish your abode* and made the heaven with its regions, spheres, celestial bodies and realms of space a construction of imposing magnitude and He sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water and with it He caused the various products to spring from the soil**, products fit to be used as food for human sustenance. Therefore, employ your faculty of reason in forming conclusions and reason high of Providence and do not equal with Him deities haunting your imagination when the instinctive perception of the truth is natural to you
And if this state of affairs is giving you occasion to uncertainty and you are in doubt about the truth and authenticity of the Quran We have been revealing in sequence to Our servant the Messenger Muhammad then produce a Surah the like thereof and call on all those besides Allah who can bear witness to its inimitable nature if you are declaring the truth
If such an undertaking you fail to fulfil, and fail, you undoubtedly will, then save yourselves the fire whose fuel shall be people and stones; the stones sculptured and statued as false gods; the fire which has been especially prepared for those who deny Allah
Meanwhile, announces O Muhammad, blissful tidings to those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and there deeds wisdom and pious: that they shall be welcomed into gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow. As often as they are offered any kind of the fruit therein, they express their thoughts in words: "But this is what we had before in life for our livelihood." In effect, they are offered what bears a marked resemblance to what they had in life, but not of a like nature; it has the power to excite relish and ecstatic delight unexperienced before. And therein shall they be accompanied by mates of their design: pure, chaste and holy fellows of their piety and therein they will have passed through nature to Eternity
Allah is by no means reluctant from fear of shame to give an allegory applying creatures as small as a gnat or a larger creature to describe subjects under the guise of some other subject of aptly suggestive resemblance intended to convey a useful lesson by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth. As to those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, they know well that the simile narrated by Allah, their Creator, is the truth personified as it illustrates and ennobles the subject. But those who deny Allah wonder to hear Allah talk after this manner and they say: "What does Allah mean by such a parable?" In effect, such parables as Allah discourses are intended to stray the many who counsel deaf to the truth and to guide the many who have clean hearts to the path of righteousness and He misguides only the wicked who confirm themselves in the evil purpose and the ill intention
The wicked who do not fulfill their covenant with Allah after they have solemnly vowed to Him to do what has been enjoined, who disjoin humanity and policy instead of being joined together and separate the two hands that join one another in fidelity, and who disjoin all that Allah has ordained be joined together, and make mischief on earth and create discord, these are they who were born to be great losers
How could you people deny Allah when you were inanimate and He brought you into being from nothingness and caused you to exist, then He shall deprive you of certain functional activities to occasion your death and then at the predetermined moment He shall resurrect you and back to Him you return for judgment
He is it Who created for you all that is on earth, then applied He Himself to. the immeasurable expanse of the realm and set it in order and arranged it in seven heavens, and He is AL-'Alim who has infinite knowledge of all things
For once Allah made a proclamation, to the angels of a great event; He said to them: "I am inducting a Vicegerent* on earth." The angels said: "Will You assign the earth to someone who shall make mischief therein, create discord and shed blood, while we adore Your Eternal Name and to You we express our feelings of warm approbation and extoll Your glorious attributes!" "But I am," said Allah, "AL-'Alim, Who knows what you do not know
Then, He created Adam; Foreknowing that he would be destined to inhabit the earth, Allah imparted to him knowledge of all the names denoting members of all classes of beings and objects, the animate and the inanimate, the material and the immaterial. He then presented them to the angels, saying: "Give Me the designations of all that I imparted to Adam if you are declaring the truth
Glory to Your Name," the angels said, "but the sum of what we know lies only in the range of the information and knowledge You imparted to us. You are indeed AL-'Alim and AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom)
Then Allah said to Adam: "Tell them, Adam, of the designations and the destined purposes of all imparted to you." and when Adam did , Allah said to the Angels: "Did I not tell you that I am AL-'Alim of all that is unknown in the heavens and on earth and of all you declare and of all you tried to conceal
There and then We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam in adoration." The angels prostrated to Adam in admiration except Iblis who declined with inordinate self-esteem. He was a disobedient rebel
We created from Adam his mate* who was mated to his design and said to him: "O Adam, make abode you and your wife in Paradise and eat as you will and wherever you will, it is all replete with choice of all delights, but do avoid this particular tree, keep off it and do not draw near it lest you both be wrongful of actions
But through envy and hatred did Iblis, take delight in the portraiture of lawless passion and succeed in tempting them both to commit themselves to what they failed to realize would be an evil line of conduct that they ate of the fruit of the forbidden tree. With the prospect of pleasure and advantage of inciting them to evil, -AL-Shaytan- precipitated their ejection from the state of supreme bliss. In consequence, We said to them: "Upon Our command to all of you, We bring you down upon from this blissful state with mutual enmity toward each other, and you shall settle on earth for a predetermined point of time
Prompted by the sense of guilt, Adam felt shame, but because guilt did not reside in the intention, Allah in mercy inspired him with a prayer for invoking His forgiveness, and in turn did Allah give up resentment against him and pardon his offence: it is He Who always accepts true repentance and the atonement made by the people, He is AL-Rahim
We said to them: "Go all of you from this blissful state, you are doomed to a lower state, and the earth shall be your state. And when it is decided that you shall receive directions thereon to guide you to the path of righteousness, then those steered by the spirit of truth into all truth shall have no ground for alarm nor shall fear or dread fall upon them nor shall they come to grief
But those who choose to reject faith, denying Allah and His ordinances, refusing to recognise Our revelations and signs, shall be inmates of Hell, wherein they shall endure forever
Oyou Bani Isra‘il: "render solemn acknowledgement of My divine favour and impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness to Me for the efficacious grace I conferred on you and keep the vow you rendered to Me so that I assert My vow to you, and regard Me with the profound reverence and awe dutiful to Me
And be strongly disposed to believe in the Quran I have been revealing, corroborating and authoritatively validating the authentic AL-Tawrah, which you possess. Yet it is indeed incredible that you have received it with incredulity and, of all people of faith, you are the first to deny it and refuse to give it solemn recognition. Do not then exchange the truth of My revelations and My Prophet for the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world, and be careful not to come within the measure of My wrath nor neglect the profound reverence dutiful to Me
Nor irreverently mix up the truth guiding into all truth and poison it with what you forge of falsehood, nor conceal the truth when you know it conforms with fact and agrees with reality
Pay reverence and veneration to Me, and duly engage in worship and give zakat (alms), for zakat is but a vehicle of prayer, and bow the knees with those who bow their knees to Me in reverence and adoration
Do you enjoin people to pay regard to what is just and right while you wilfully neglect to apply your hearts to wisdom and piety, when you peruse AL- Tawrah, and have knowledge of its text? Do you have no more sense than to indulge yourselves in vanity
Resort to patience to possess your souls and have recourse to prayer, for more things are wrought by prayer, than this world dreams of, albeit that the practice of praying to Allah is viewed by people as involving labour and effort and is hard to accomplish, but not by those who humble themselves to Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Who bear in mind, affirming with faith’s eye the certainty that they shall be in the venerable and revered Majestic presence of Allah, their Creator, and that they shall inevitably go back to Him
O you Bani Israil: "Render solemn acknowledgement to My divine favour and impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness to Me for the efficacious grace I conferred on you and that I confined to you such prerogative as to be the chosen* for My mercy and blessings out of all people
And guard yourselves against the horror, the Day when no soul shall be allowed to pay the debt owed to Allah by another, nor shall humble intercession be accepted from any one on behalf of another, nor shall the equivalent in ransom pay for the expiation of the guilt of another nor shall any tutelary protector, other than Allah, be a very present help in the inevitable trouble
Recall that We rescued you from tyranny and oppression suffered at the hands of the people of Pharaoh, who brutally slaughtered your sons and to serve their purpose they spared your women; this was indeed a severe but sure test of your actions and reactions echoing your true beliefs and the prevalent inclinations among you
And recall to the mind the big event of parting the sea to make a foot path for you across and We rescued you from the vengeful people of Pharaoh who pursued you, with malignancy and injurious action, and We drowned them before your eyes
Then We ordained the divine assignation for Mussa and arranged the place and the time where and when We would be exposed to his mental view and he was in audience of Us after the completion of exclusive religious devotion for fourty nights, and you became impatient and paid reverence and veneration to the calf which you regarded it as a godhead, characterizing yourselves by perversity of judgment and wrong actions
Yet We granted Mussa his prayer and extended to you Our mercy and forgiveness that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude
We gave Mussa the Book, the canon, illuminating the intellect and imparting the soundness of judgement in the choice of what is morally good, honest and straightforward, so that you may hopefully be guided into all truth
And that once when you idolised the calf and Mussa said to you: "My people, you have indeed characterised yourselves by perversity of judgement and perversed the divine command by idolising the calf, and this is an affront nothing but blood can expiate! Therefore, stand repentant in lowliest plight to Allah, your Creator, and slay the wrongful of action among you, then you will have pursued the acceptable course to Allah, your Creator." Yet Allah give up resentment against you and pardoned your offence; it is He Who always accepts true repentance and people’s atonement and He is AL-Tawab (the Relenting) and AL-Rahim
Again you said to Mussa:" "We will not recognise your mission until we see Allah personally and perceive Him by sight." "There and then did heaven reverberate thunder against you and the fearful echoes thundered in your ears and with lightning did heaven strike you dead as you gazed your souls away
Then We revived you and the ambitious hopes which had seemed extinguished had been revived in your bosoms so that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
We overshadowed you with the clouds to protect you from the heat of the sun and We ordained that the heavens provision you with "AL Manna", the continual dew of Our blessed victuals, and with the quails, and We said: "Eat of the worthy victuals with which We provisioned you. " Yet these people were determined to defy Our authority; they did not actually wrong Us, but in fact it was themselves that they had wronged indeed
Remember that once We extended Our mercy to you redeeming you from the wilderness. We said to you: "Make entry into this town –AL-Quds- and eat as you will, wherever you will; it is all replete with choice of all delights and enjoy all that is wholesome and affords pleasure. Humble yourselves and bow your knees to Me as you go through the gate and let your bosoms surge forth and answer thanks. Express your thoughts in words invoking Me to relieve your hearts and unload your burden of sins. We will forgive your iniquities and reward those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety with what runs higher than what corresponds with their piety
But the wrongful of actions had exchanged the virtuous spoken discourse authorized by heaven for the false discourse of their own making and in consequence did Heaven come upon them with a forcible impact of a torturing punishment in requital of their wickedness
Recall to the mind that once when your people suffered thirst in the wilderness and Mussa prayed Us for water to slake their parched lips and quench their thirst and We said to him: "Strike the rock with your staff " and there gushed forth twelve springs and each tribe knew the spring belonging to them and then We said to them: "Eat and drink of the blessed victuals with which Allah has provisioned you and stop making mischief on earth and refrain yourselves from creating discord
Again that once when you said to Mussa: "we cannot bear to eat always the same kind of food nor can we put up with it, and so beseech Allah, your Creator, on our behalf to make the soil produce for us what it vegetates of its verdure and of its cucumber, its garlic and lentils and of its onions. "Displeased as he was, Mussa said: "Will you people exchange the worthy and wholesome food for the food of the lower quality! " "If this be your wish, then leave Sinai and go down to a town and you will come to have what you asked for". There and then were they stamped with humiliation and misery and came within the measure of Allah's wrath. This was in the train of their denial of Allah's revelations and signs demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority and of bringing death unjustifiably upon the Prophets of their own nation. Such vices were a sequel to the disobedience natural to them that it drew after it their addiction to transgression
Nonetheless, those who are disposed to believe in the Prophets who dated far back into the past, and those who profess Judaism and the Christians, the various sects of the Sabeites or Mendaites and of the Sabians, and those who fall in line with the Prophet Muhammad, whoever believes in Allah, His Oneness, Uniqueness, Sameness, Omnipotence, Omnipresence and Ultimate Authority and acknowledges the truth of Resurrection and Judgment and whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety, shall Heaven reward them all for their homage thereto. No fear nor dread shall fall upon them nor shall they come to grief
Also, recall to the mind that once when you camped at the foot of the Mount and heaven thundered and the awe –inspiring- echoes thundered in your ears as We entered with you into a covenant and We stabilized the Mount above you when it shook with such fits of awe for the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, and We said: "Adhere to all that We have imparted to you AL-Tawrah and observe the code of discipline and body of regulations and hold them in esteem and hold to your promise, pay attention and regard to it and be mindful of Our commandments so that you may hopefully entertain the profound reverence dutiful Allah
Thus still you have been disobedient, and had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you, you would have incurred privation and suffered a great loss
You knew those of you who broke the Sabbath We set apart for rest and worship, and you defiled yourselves with sin and so did heaven lay your transgression to your charge and decreed that you be monkeyfied and your monkey-like character and behaviour be viewed with contempt, and that you be despised and rejected of men
Such fateful attribute We ascribed to them was intended to serve as an example to their contemporaries and to those who would follow, as well as a caution to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
Also, that once when Mussa said to his people: "Allah commands you to sacrifice a cow". They said to Mussa: "Are you trying to make us the object of a practical joke?" Mussa said: "Allah forbid that I be a simpleton
They said to Mussa: "Beseech Allah, your Creator, to point out to us the kind of cow". Mussa said: Allah says: "It is a cow neither old nor young but in an intermediate stage and now Allah has commanded and you shall have to obey
Again they said: "Beseech Allah, your Creator, on our behalf to indicate to us its colour". Mussa said: Allah says: "It is a vivid yellow cow particularly attractive to beholders
Again they said to Mussa: "Beseech Allah, your Creator, on our behalf to specify the characteristic features of the cow since to us all cows are alike, and Allah willing we will be able to find the cow meeting the said features
Mussa said: "Allah says it is a cow that has not been used in ploughing the land nor watering the fields, a cow free of all physical defects." There and then they said to Mussa: "Now you have brought us the truth," and they slaughtered the cow in sacrifice in spite of hesitation though they almost did not
And you slew a man and the case was wrapped in mystery and you all tried to absolve yourselves of the blood guilt, but Allah would not permit it and He exposed the truth which you tried to conceal
Their and then We commanded Mussa to say to you: "Strike the corpse with a piece of the heifer’s carcass," and there the man was brought to life only for as long as he made known in a supernatural manner, the name of the man who had killed him. Thus, Allah exhibits His unlimited power to effect what He will, in any manner He will and to resurrect all the dead when He will. He displays to you His signs and His marvels demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority so that you may hopefully comprehend and lift to Him your inward sight
Thereafter, with all the blessings and mercy Allah extended to you, your hearts have been as hard as stone or even harder. In fact, among massive stones are some from which rivers gush out flowing copiously, others split to allow water to flow in streams and others shake with such fits of awe, shaking and splitting into atoms for the profound reverence dutiful to Allah is not unaware of all you do
O Muslims do you really expect that Ahl al-Kitab (the Jews) would accept or believe or fall in line with you when some of them (the rabbi) comprehended the word of Allah and His precepts represented in AL-Tawrah and perverted the truth with falsehood
When they meet the true believers face to face they declare that they have conformed their will to Allah’s. And when they are with their like-minded companions they are reprehended for conversing with the Muslims on Muhammad's mission documented in AL-Tawrah previously when assenting to this truth is against their interest; They say to them: "Do you reveal to the Muslims knowledge Allah entrusted to us so that they use it against us in the venerable, Majestic presence of Allah, your Creator; Have you no sense as to exercise the faculty of reason
Do they not know that Allah knows what they exchange secretly or whisper and what they suggest secretly and all feelings stored in their hearts, and He is well acquainted with all they utter out loud
Among them are illiterates who do not know the precepts nor the mandates according with AL-Tawrah’s texts; they only know what the demagogic rabbi had purposed, and the knowledge they imparted was wholly infested with falsehood yielding only false hopes vested with ignorance and illiteracy, thus affording conjecture
In cconsequence, woe upon those who reproduce Allah’s Book by wording it differently in a demagogic way, distorting meanings and relating them to Allah in order to exchange the truth for the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. Woe betide them for their wrongful and unclean hands, they shall be miserable as a result of their sinful iniquities
They say: "Fire will not touch us but for a certain number of days". Say to them, O Muhammad: "Was that a promise Allah made to you granting you future security against vindication and in consequence you are relieved, knowing that Allah never breaks His promise! Or do you relate to Allah a world in a grain of sand or a heaven in a wild flower and your comfort flows from ignorance
Truly you people take liberties to impudently assume Allah. Indeed, the inequitable have guilt residing in their intention, and wrongful actions beset them on all sides, their punishment shall be commensurate with their deeds, and such persons are the inmates of Hell wherein they shall last forever
Whereas the faithful, of wise and pious deeds, shall rejoice beyond a common joy; they shall be welcomed into gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity
Again, We entered into a Covenant with Bani Isra‘il, thus: “You worship no one but Allah,” We said, “and adore Him with appropriate rites and commit your parents to your kind care and express a friendly and kind disposition to your kindred, the orphans and the poor and talk to people with eloquence and forbearance and engage in worship and give zakat for zakat is but a vehicle of prayer.” Yet you counselled deaf and paid no attention, with exception of a few who opened their hearts’ ears and heeded Our ordinance
Again, We entered into another Covenant declaring thus: "Do not shed your own blood", We said, "nor expel each other from your dwellings," and you sanctioned it and bore witness to its validity as stated in your own AL-Tawrah
Yet again you ignore the principles you supported and you kill each other and expel some of your own people from their homes and you ally yourselves with their enemies in sin and transgression against the divine law and moral principles. When some of them fall into captivity you revert to the principles in AL-Tawrah and redeem them, albeit the same principles forbid you to shed your own blood nor to expel each other from your homes. Do you people credit part of the Book upon the ground of Allah’s Authority and discredit part upon the ground of your authority? Indeed, he who adopts this line of conduct shall suffer for his offence; he shall be lost to shame here. Such persons shall be delivered to the abyss with its torrential scorching and roaring flames Hereafter; they shall suffer torment and be put to torture; and Allah is not unaware of what you do
These people, O Muhammad, have exchanged the Hereafter for here below, with gazes fixed upon the world and its vanities; their suffering shall never abate nor shall their excruciating pain be mitigated nor can anyone help them out of their misery
You, Bani Isra‘il, know that We gave Mussa AL-Tawrah and We sent other Prophets sequentially: We sent ‘Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam, with clear revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and enlightenment, and We supported him by giving him countenance by the Holy Spirit. Yet is it not indeed incredible that as often as a Prophet is sent to you with divine principles not to your taste, you become extravagant in your account of yourselves and display inordinate self-confidence? Some you renounce and some you accuse of assuming false character, and others you kill or you conspire their death
They say to you, O Muhammad: "Our hearts’ ears are deaf, and our hearts treasure every branch of divine knowledge and wisdom that we can no longer absorb." The fact is Allah has cursed them for their irreverence and impiety. How their faith in Allah is shaken
When a Book was presented to them from Heaven, a Book , a treasure purposed to this life and life beyond, corroborating AL-Tawrah, they refused to accept it although it clearly foretold the Prophet Muhammad's coming; an event they had always been expecting and at times wishing it be hastened on to help them get the upper hand in argument and gain advantages in arguments and victories in wars over those who deny Allah. Yet when the prophesy was fulfilled and the Prophet Muhammad came with the Quran, they refused to acknowledge the truth of his mission. Consequently, Allah has consigned those who deny Him to misery and their homes shall be cursed
How worthless is the price they received for selling their souls to immorality and wickedness, inequitably rejecting the truth received from Allah guiding into all truth; a defying impiety induced by transgression -natural to them- and by base envy reflecting sincere hatred upon those whom Allah Has mercifully granted, the prerogative of Prophethood, an unreachable excellence. There and then they came again within the measure of Allah's wrath and incurred wrath upon wrath, and the punishment is humiliating to those who deny Allah and ignore His commands
And when they are told to acknowledge the statutes Allah has imparted to the Prophet Muhammad, the last of Allah’s Messengers carrying the enacted law entrusted by Allah, they say: "We only acknowledge what has been imparted to us," and they deny and renounce all else when they know the truth validating AL- Tawrah. Say to them, O Muhammad: "Why then did you slay Allah’s Prophets in the past if your hearts are truly faithful
Mussa came to you in earlier times with clear revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and enlightenment, yet in his absence, you paid reverence and veneration to the calf and committed yourselves to evil conduct and wrong behaviour
And Recall when you camped at the foot of Mount and heaven thundered and the awe inspiring echoes thundered in your ears as We entered with you into a Covenant and We stabilized the mountain above you when it shook with such fits for the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and We said: "Adhere to all that We have imparted to you in AL-Tawrah and observe and esteem the code of discipline and regulations, hold to your promise, pay attention and regard". And your people said: "We have opened our hearts' ears " But their actions did not accord to their words. They impiously took the calf and drank with delight, to tame their wicked feelings. Say to them, O Muhammad: "If these are the principles of your faith steering your course of action, then how worthless is your apprehension of divine truth and system of religious belief, if you truly represent yourselves as people of faith
Say to them, O Muhammad: "If you truly believe in eternal bliss, excluding all else then wish yourselves dead if you declare the truth
But never shall they wish their death because of what their wrongful hands have committed; and Allah knows the wrongful well
You shall find them, O Muhammad, of all people, the most eager, for longevity, even more than the Pagans, none of them aims for the grave but would rather be entangled in the web of life for a thousand years. But nothing shall alter his punitive destiny even if he is carried through the stealing steps of age to this desired advanced life span, and Allah is Bassirun (Omnipresent): He sees all that they do
Say to them, O Muhammad: they must realize he who defies Jibril (Gabriel), it is he who imparts the Quran to your consciousness with Allah’s Authority, corroborating AL-Tawrah and carrying the torch of truth guiding into all truth, inspiring those with faithful hearts with blissful tidings
He who defies Allah, His angels, His Prophets, Jibril and Mikhail, must realise that Allah is at enmity with those who deny Him and deny those who serve Him
We have imparted to you, O Muhammad, clear Quranic revelations guiding away from want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and enlightenment, and none refuses to acknowledge them but the perverse depraved and faithless
Is it not the case that when they make a promise to you, O Muhammad and to others before you, some of them always break it? In fact, most of them are faithlessly disposed
And when the prophesy in the authentic AL-Tawrah was fulfilled and the Prophet Muhammad arrived carrying the final message from Allah with the Quran validating AL-Tawrah, some of them shut their eyes to the prophesy ignoring their own Book which conforms to the will of Allah and turned their backs upon it as if they were never aware
And they pursued vanity and neglected religion; they were attracted to characteristics befitting AL-Shayatin who attributed Sulayman's (Solomon) prerogative of Prophethood and power to the art of sorcery and occult qualities; a defying impiety and a serious offence for which Sulayman was innocent. In fact it was the blasphemers who defied Allah. They taught people necromancy which they practised through contact with evil spirits and through the knowledge they acquired from revelations imparted to the two angelic Babylonians Harut and Marut. But Harut and Marut made it clear that their art was a source of temptation and an incitement to evil and they cautioned against indulgence as it meant defiance to Allah. Yet those blasphemers pursued the evil aspect of this art using those spirits to sow discord between husband and wife and other similar evil acts. Nonetheless no one suffers harm unless divinely predetermined. They applied themselves to learning the art which inflicts harm upon them and they derive no profit from it. Yet they knew that he who engages in sorcery for vice shall have no bliss of the Hereafter; how worthless was the price they received for selling their own souls to immorality and wickedness if they only knew
Had they truthfully believed in Allah and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him, Allah would have been their hope and His mercy and blessings would have been far better than what they lost if they only knew
O you, faithful believers: Do not address the Prophet in Hebrew disrespectfully. Do not say "Ra’ina" when you desire His attention, instead say, "‘Unzurna" or turn your attention directing your eye upon us; and those who defy Allah shall endure torture
Neither the faithless of Ahl al-Kitab who defy Allah nor the Pagans wish that you receive Allah’s mercy and blessings, but Allah extends His mercy to whom He will. He is the source of sufficient grace abounding in whom He will and of the efficacious grace effecting ends
They question, O Muhammad, the wisdom of abrogation in certain circumstances. None of Our revelations or signs, secondary in character, do We terminate, but We replace it with a better or equivalent substitute; do you not know that Allah is Qadirun (Omnipotent) to effect all things
Do you not know that the Sovereign Authority and the supreme control of the heavens and earth resides with Allah, and besides Him you people have no guardian nor can any one afford you help
Or do you people wish to challenge your Prophet to produce supernatural acts as Mussa was challenged to perform earlier by his contemporaries who demanded to see Allah personally? Indeed, he who exchanges Faith for disbelief will have wronged himself and wandered from the path of righteousness
Many of Ahl al-Kitab wish they could turn you renegades, a desire induced by base envy reflecting sincere hatred for you people who have conformed to Islam, even though they have recognized the truth. Nevertheless, forgive them and do not entertain them with antagonistic thoughts until Allah circumstances matters of fact in His own manner and His command comes to pass. Allah is indeed Qadirun over all in all
And participate in the act of divine worship, giving zakat, for zakat is but a vehicle of prayer, and whatever you advance of piety toward future security, you shall find preserved in heaven’s realm. Allah is Bassirun (Omnipresent): He sees all that you do
And in their way of thinking they say: "No one shall be admitted to Paradise and enjoy the bliss and surpassing beauty of the Hereafter but he who conforms to Judaism or Christianity". This is the imagination.they entertain Say to them, O Muhammad: "Produce your convincing evidence if you declare the truth
But it is only he who gives a good impression to Allah, serving His purpose with wise and pious deeds: who shall find a pleasing reward in heaven’s realm and no fear or dread shall fall upon him nor shall he come to grief
And yet the Jews say: "The Christians are prone to a system not based upon truth." And the Christians say: "The Jews rely on a religion without the groundwork of truth, while both of them learn from the same Book." Without much knowledge of the Book, the Pagans said this but Allah shall judge them in Day of Judgement* in matters concerning their variance
And who is more wrong-minded than he who blocks the way to places of divine worship by placing obstacles and intends to destroy them in attempt to prevent religious observance and to preclude the adoration of Allah's Eternal Name Such persons were not to enter these places except secretly, fearing for their life. They shall suffer disgrace and multiple humiliations here, and be put to the torture Hereafter
And to Allah belong the East with its four cardinal points where the sun rises and the West with its four cardinal points where the sun sets, and therefore to whichever point in the universe you turn you shall be in Allah's August Presence. Allah is Wasi’un (Omnipresent),and 'Alimun
And yet they say: "Allah has begotten a son." Glory be to Him, His glorious attributes extolled, but to Him all that exists in the heavens and earth belong to Him and all exercise a submissive reverence to His Authority
He is it Who generated the heavens and earth and when He ordains something He only says: "Be" and it is
And those who are so ignorant to know the truth vented their hearts, which are overflowing with the sense of sin, they said: “If only Allah would speak to us or display a sign evincing both Muhammad's Prophethood and integrity!” This much said those who preceded them who had similar natured hearts as those who succeeded them. Their thoughts are so base, pursuing vanity. We have expounded Our revelations and signs evincing both Omnipotence and Authority to people who lift to Allah their inward sight
We have sent you, O Muhammad, with the truth as a spectacle and a warning to all, and you shall not be responsible for those who are born to be fuel for the fires of Hell
In fact, neither the Jews nor the Christians shall be pleased with you, O Muhammad until you conform to their system of faith. Say to them: "Indeed it is only the course steered by Allah the one and only way that leads to the path of righteousness with Providence as the guide. And should you be tempted to follow their wishes, given the knowledge imparted to you, then do not expect Allah to maintain you under His tutelage
Those people to whom We gave AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil, who read their Book with careful scrutiny in search of truth, shall recognize what really proceeded from Allah and what has been adulterated by base admixture of false glosses. Such persons shall comprehend the truth and accordingly honour the Quran. And he who refuses to acknowledge the truth proceeded from Allah shall be an inherent loser
O you Bani Isra‘il: "Render solemn acknowledgement of My divine favour and impel yourselves with the feeling of gratitude to Me for the efficacious grace I conferred upon you and that I confined you to such prerogative as to be chosen* out of all people for My mercy and blessings
Guard yourselves from the horror of the Day when no soul shall be allowed to pay the debt owed to Allah by another, nor shall the equivalent in ransom pay for the expiation of the guilt of one soul or another, nor shall humble intercession be accepted from anyone on behalf of another, nor shall any tutelary protector other than Allah be of any help in the inevitable trouble
For once Allah tested Ibrahim with divine commands which Ibrahim had fulfilled. In response Allah said to him: "I have ordained to appoint you as the Imam, or religious leader, of mankind". "Will this apply to my descendants?" asked Ibrahim. "My appointment," said Allah, "is not designated to the wrong- minded
We ordained the Sacred House -the Ka’ba- a safe retreat for people, that you Muslims take Ibrahim’s station where he performed the prescribed acts of devotion, as a place of prayer. And We committed Ibrahim and Isma‘il to cleanse My House from moral and spiritual defilement and to impart real sacredness upon it and ceremonially purify it for those who revolve in it in procession ,for those who retreat for religious observance, for those who kneel in supplication, prostrating mentally and willfully acknowledging Allah's Omnipotence, perfection and Authority, and those who prostrate their reason to divine revelation
Then Ibrahim made a devout and humble supplication to Allah to bless the city of Macca. He prayed: “I beseech You, Allah, my Creator, to make this city a safe retreat affording security and peace of mind. And provision its people with the earth’s kind fruits favouring those among them who believed in Allah and in Day of Judgement with hearts impressed with religious and spiritual virtues.” “Quite the contrary”, Allah said, “but also he who shall be denied the heaven's bliss I will satisfy in life. I make him hold and enjoy the same to a predetermined point, then I will drive him into Hell. How evil is his destiny!”
And as Ibrahim and Isma‘il were laying the foundation of the Sacred House they prayed: "O Allah, our Creator, accept this service from us. You are AL- Bassir with unlimited audition, AL-'Alim
And make out of both of us, O Allah, our Creator, two Muslims who conform their will to Yours and of our descendants a Muslim nation who conforms their will to Yours. And show us our rites and articles of our faith and the prescribed order of performing religious and other devotional services and turn to us in mercy; You are AL-Tawab (the Relenting),and AL-Rahim,(the Merciful)
And send in their midst, O Allah, our Creator, a Prophet from among them to recite Your revelations, to teach them the Book, to acquaint their hearts with wisdom and to impart sanctity unto them; You are AL-Aziz(Almighty),and AL- Hakim (the Source of wisdom)
Who would reject Ibrahim’s system of faith and worship but a deranged fool? We have conferred such a prerogative confined to him here, and he shall be among the virtuous and nearest to Allah Hereafter
When Allah said to him: "Conform your will to Mine", he answered: "I vow to resign myself to Allah, Creator of the universe, and conform my will to His blessed will
There and then Ibrahim bequeathed this rich legacy to his sons as later did his grandson Ya’qub (Jacob); they both enjoined their sons to the same belief. "O my Sons", they said, "Allah has chosen for you a particular system of faith and worship, you are enjoined to observe and practice it, therefore, adhere to it so that when death lays its hands upon you, and you pass through his door you will have conformed your will to Allah's blessed will
Or you people were present when Ya’qub lay on his deathbed and you testify that he enjoined his sons to adhere to a system of faith other than Islam? In fact, you knew well that on his deathbed Ya’qub gathered his sons and said to them: "Whom shall you worship after I have departed life?" they said: "We will pay reverence to Allah, your Allah, the Ilah of your fathers, Ibrahim, Isma‘il and Ishak (Isaac), One Ilah to Whom we display our devotion and adoration by appropriate acts and rites conforming our will to His blessed wil"l
These were a people who passed through nature to Eternity; they are accountable for their deeds and you are accountable for yours, and you shall not be responsible for their deeds
Yet once more Ahl Al-Kitab explicitly say: "Be Jews or Christians, and thus be guided into all truth". Say to them, O Muhammad: "But rather the religion of Ibrahim as the true and straightforward, and his system of faith and worship; never did he incorporate with Allah other deities
O Muslims, declare thus: "We believe in Allah and in all that has been imparted to us and in the Quran and in all that was imparted to Ibrahim and Isma‘il, Ishaq and Ya’qub and to the tribes of his twelve sons and to Mussa and ‘Isa. And we believe in all that was imparted to Allah’s Prophets; We do not discriminate between them and we conform our will to His blessed will; He is the heart of our purpose
So, if they faithfully espouse the same system of faith, worship and principles as you, then the spirit of truth has guided them into all truth, but if they should turn a deaf ear then they are at variance, and Allah’s blessings, like a beacon, shall guard you from their inequities; He is AL-Sami’(all- Hearing),and AL-'Alim
Say to them: "If your baptism symbolises purification and initiation, then who can confer a better spiritual baptism than Allah .He is the heart of our purpose and to His blessed will we submit ours
Say to them, O Muhammad: "Do you dispute the definitive action Allah chooses for His message when He is Our Creator and we are all accountable for our deeds! Our hearts surge up and answer sincere thanks to Him
Or do you claim that Ibrahim and Isma‘il, Ishak and Ya’qub and the Tribes were Jews or Christians when you know that AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil were sent down to Mussa and ‘Isa, founders of Judaism and Christianity? Do you know better than Allah, AL-Sami’ and AL-’Alim? Who is more wrongful than he who hides an attestation from Allah? Allah is not unaware of all you do
These were a people who have passed through nature to Eternity; they are accountable for their actions and you are accountable for yours, and you shall not be responsible for their deeds
And the fool among the people, were excited by the perception of an unexpected and inexplicable, bewildering event, so they began to speak their thoughts; they said: "What made the Muslims change their Qiblah, the direction to which they turn at prayer?" Say to them, O Muhammad: "To Allah belong the East with its four cardinal points where the sun rises and the West with its four cardinal points where the sun sets; He guides whom He will to the path of righteousness
Thus We made an ‘Umma (nation) of you Muslims with balanced reason so that you be witnesses of peoples’ actions characterizing their rival systems. The Prophet would be a witness of your actions, and your deeds are a witness of your worth. We initially established AL-Quds as the Kiblah toward which you, Muhammad, turned in prayer distinguishing those who obey the Prophet and exposing the disobedient who turn on their heels, reversing their position. This was hard on those with the rich legacy of Ibrahim before them but they bowed to Providence as their guide. Allah was not going to annul your religious and spiritual virtues, for Allah displays kindness to those who serve Him and those who do not: His mercy is extended to all
We have seen you, O Muhammad, turning your face skyward in expectation of something desired, hopeful of a change relative to Ibrahim, leader of mankind. Thus, We will appoint a Kiblah for you to meet your expectation. Therefore, wherever you may be, turn your face in prayer toward the Sacred Mosque, the Ka’ba at Macca. As for Ahl Al-Kitab, they know this to be the truth from Allah, their Creator, and Allah is not unaware of all they do
If you, Muhammad, were to present Ahl Al-Kitab with signs evincing your Prophethood and Allah’s Omnipotence and Authority, they shall never follow your Kiblah nor shall you follow theirs, nor shall they follow each other’s Qiblah, and should you be tempted to follow their vain wishes given the knowledge imparted to you, then you will miss the path of righteousness and indeed be wrong
In fact, Ahl Al-Kitab received the Scriptures from Us foretelling all present events. They know the truth of your mission very well. They know of the Quran and the Qiblah and assert their existence as much as their sons’ identity, but some of them hide the evident truth
But the truth has proceeded to you, O Muhammad, from Allah, your Creator, therefore do not permit their false assertions to cause you doubt and anxiety
Every one, individually or in a group, justifying faith as a conviction operative on the character and will, is distinguished by attributes characterizing him or the group with a particular aim or goal. Or with a Kiblah meeting his or their expectations and may or may not be based on spiritual apprehension of divine truths past or present. This must not be the cause inducing you people to contend against each other. The cause for which you should be ready to contend to your life's end is good will and deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety. One day, wherever you may be, shall Allah bring you all together to His venerable Majestic presence; He is indeed Qadirun over all things
And whenever you, Muhammad, depart from a place, turn your face at prayer toward the Sacred Mosque, for it is indeed the truth proceeding from Allah, your Creator, and Allah is not unaware of all that you do
Again, whenever you depart from a place, always turn your face at prayer toward the Sacred Mosque and wherever you people may be, inside or outside, turn your faces at prayer to ward it, so that you people do not stand at the mark of criticism by others except by the wrongful. Do not fear them but fear and revere Me so that I may bestow My favour upon you, and you may be guided into all truth
Even as We sent to you people a Prophet from among you to recite to you Our revelations, and impart sanctity, teach you the Book and acquaint your hearts with wisdom and with what you did not knew intellectually nor spiritually
Therefore, bear Me in mind with reverence so that I bear you in mind and impel yourselves with gratitude. And do not be callous with hearts barren of faith
O you who believe with faithful hearts: seek consolation in patience and in prayer and draw your souls close to Allah. Allah upholds the patient who endure trouble with calmness and composure, showing forbearance under provocation, bearing with others their faults and limitations and showing constancy in labour and effort
Do not consider the martyrs in Allah’s cause to be dead. They carried truth’s banners against odds and have acquired the glorious privilege of martyrdom through resisting shedding blood with spiritual armour. Do not say, "They are dead", for they are alive in heaven's realm but your senses do not perceive this fact
We will afflict you with some disagreeable events and misfortunes to test your faith’s qualities. We will make you experience fear, hunger and loss of wealth and lives, and a diminished yield in the earth’s fruits. But announce, O Muhammad, blissful tidings to the patient and constantly persevering, unwearied in the face of difficulties and hindrances
Who lift to Allah their inward sight when befallen with a misfortune or a calamity, expressing themselves thus: "We belong to Allah and to Him shall we return
These are the recipients of Allah's efficacious grace, on whom Allah, their Creator, has conferred His blessings and mercy. Providence guides them into all truth
Behold, the mounts of Safa and Marwa in Macca, long-time objects of superstition to the idolaters, are in fact territorial divinities. Therefore, he who goes on AL-Hajj (pilgrimage) to the Sacred Mosque or on the minor Hajj, the ‘Umra, incurs no blame to go round in procession, and he who offers of his own accord to perform this virtuous rite shall find Allah responsive to pious actions. Indeed, Allah acknowledges what is esteemed a worthy deed; He is 'Alimun
Indeed, those who conceal the knowledge of the clear signs and revelations guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and from want of spiritual and intellectual vision into mental illumination and enlightenment have come within the measure of Allah's wrath. They have earned the curse of Allah and of the angels and of the pious whose curse damages the accused; their own homes shall be cursed
But such misfortune would be cancelled for those who repent, make amends and declare the truth. Such persons shall come in My grace. I will pardon their offence. It is I who accept true repentance and people’s atonement. I am AL- Rahim
Those denying Allah, and rejecting the Faith, who died captivated in disbelief, had come within the measure of Allah's wrath. Such persons have earned the curse of Allah, the angels and of mankind
Such a curse of divine wrath and malignant fate shall follow them like their shadow until the day when they are dragged in chains into Hell, confined with shackles and put to unrelenting torment nor shall their punishment be put in respite
Your Allah is One Ilah; there is no Ilah but Him, AL-Rahman and AL-Rahim
The creation of the heavens and the earth, the constant alternation symbolizing night and day, the ships sailing and navigating for transport ,the rain* Allah sends down from the floor of heaven’s vault where He revives the earth after suffering death**, and what He scattered over it of animate beings, in addition to the air circulating in various directions with varying degrees of weight and pressure and the clouds** floating at various heights in the upper air, circulating in servitude between the vault of heaven and earth; are indeed signs with prodigies emblematic of Omnipotence and Authority, sensed by those who reflect
Yet among people are those who equal with Allah deities haunting their imagination and regard them with the same affection and devotion dutiful only to Allah. But those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand maintain Allah in the inmost affection of their hearts and reverence Him with true and affectionate devotion and consider Him the principle of their existence, the heart of their purpose and their Ultimate end. And if only the wrongful of actions could visualize the torture awaiting them, they would realize that to Allah belongs all power, and that Omnipotence is asserted as His own; He punishes severely
Then those who were authoritatively followed would declare their innocence distinguishing themselves from those who followed their path. No sooner do they perceive the penalty imposed for the evil wrought by want of thought,than the ties of their common belief would have been severed
Then those adherent disciples who followed would say: "If only we could have the chance to go back to life below we would withdraw their worldly interests and renounce them and their errors as they have renounced us Hereafter." Thus does Allah show them that their evil deeds now represent nothing but the trappings of woe and never shall they be released from Hell
O you people, eat of what is on earth. It is replete with choice of all delights, and enjoy all purity, lawfulness and wholesomeness and not what is forbidden. Do not follow AL-Shaytan’s footsteps nor walk in the footsteps of those with characteristics befitting AL-Shaytan; he is indeed your avowed enemy
He incites you and commands your sympathy to commit yourselves to an evil line of conduct and to disregard the horror of immorality, besides relating to Allah claims you know not to be true or false
And when the unbelievers are told to recognize Allah’s revelations consenting to them, they say: "We only lean on our fathers system of faith and worship." But how will it be if their fathers lacked sound Judgement in choosing means and ends and miss the path of righteousness
Their negative response to the Prophet fits exactly the example of the cattle’s response to the herdsman urging them forward: either of them can hear only the utterance but none of them can intelligently distinguish between shades of meaning nor perceive value differences; deaf, dumb and blind, they cannot claim the discourse with their intellect
O you who believe with faithful hearts: eat the worthy foods, We provisioned you, and impel yourselves to gratitude to Allah, if indeed it is He Whom you worship
He only forbids you to eat the flesh of a dead beast, and blood, the flesh of swine and the flesh of a beast slaughtered under the invocation of a name other than Allah’s. But under compelling circumstances, not through wilful disobedience and transgression, shall Allah relax the status of a sin incurred; Allah is indeed Ghafurun (Forgiving),and Rahimun
Those who keep others from the knowledge of Allah’s clear revelations in AL-Tawrah and exchange the truth for the worthless vanity of the ephemeral world, simply consume nothing but fire in their bellies. Allah shall ignore them in Day of Judgement, He shall not absolve them from guilt nor from notorious crimes and they shall be put to torment
These are the ones who have been steered by false beliefs and exchanged Providence's guidance to the path of righteousness for the perplexed path in a maze, and forgiveness and mercy for torment and torture; how persistent they are in their struggle to cast themselves to Hell
Such a destiny they incurred is simply the consequence of their negative response to the Book of virtues Allah revealed in truth and sincerity, and those who disputed its precepts have set themselves at variance, unable to mend this discord
Conformity of life and conduct in divine law for righteous living does not simply mean turning your faces at prayer toward the east or the west, but it entails adherence to principles serving as the basis of Allah’s system of faith and worship. It entails that you believe in Allah and in the Day of Judgement with faithful hearts, that you entertain with profound reverence the belief on ground of Authority in Allah’s, spiritual beings, attendants and Messengers, that you solemnly consent to Allah’s Books revealed to His Prophets and to the Prophets themselves, that you spend of your wealth in benevolence and benefaction on the poor among your kindred, on the orphans, on those in need and on the wayfarer who has no means of transportation, on those who make a request for aid in times of difficulty or distress and on redeeming and setting free servants who are completely divested of freedom and personal rights, that you engage in the act of appropriate worship, that you give zakat for zakat is the vehicle of prayer, that you fulfil the promise when you make one and that you exercise patience when befallen with a misfortune and the distress of warfare against enemies. These are the ones who have characterized themselves with virtuous qualities and stand true in Allah’s honour and these are the ones who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
O you who believe with faithful hearts, a prescriptive rule for retaliation is decreed for you to observe in the case of wilful murder as thus: a free man enjoying civil liberty for a free man enjoying civil liberty, a servant divested of freedom and personal rights for a slave with identical circumstances, a woman for a woman of the same social position. But if a brother (co-religionist) is in a position to forgive, then forgiveness should go hand in hand with sound Judgement and the demands should be agreeable to reason as judged appropriate to the circumstances. And the blood guilty should answer the demand in good will, with liberality and generosity. This is an admission of relaxation advanced by Allah, your Creator, in mercy to you. But he who transgresses thereafter shall be put to the torment
O you people of understanding, you have a bond in the law of retaliation with restraining force putting a check on wilful murder, redressing grievances, and conferring on you protection and security, that you may hopefully lift to Allah your inward sight and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
A prescriptive rule is decreed when you feel death approaching and he possesses useful, exchangeable valuables he shall leave behind, then he shall bequeath part of it equitably to the parents and next of kin. This is an obligation for those who are dutiful and revere Allah
If the will was not committed to writing but the intention was expressed verbally, then the auditor or auditors who change the deceased's equitable and just intention shall incur a deadly sin; Allah is Sami’un (with unlimited audition), and ’Alimun
But he who believes the testator has wronged without guilty intentions or if the testator’s motives were selfish and unjust and tries to redress the wrong and bring peace among those concerned, he shall incur no sin; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
O you who believe with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues: the prescriptive rule of fasting is decreed for you to observe as it was observed by those who came before you in time, so that you may entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and lift to Him your inward sight
It is a religious observance that lasts for a fixed number of days. But those of you who are sick or proceeding on a journey shall compensate the fast by the same number of days at a later date. As for those who experience hardship caused by fasting, they appease Allah by expiation of feeding an indigent. Nonetheless, he who voluntarily offers to commit good shall find benevolence and benefaction indeed rewarding; and if you are able to fast, it profits you, if only you knew
Ramadan is the month of fasting during which the Quran’s poignant disclosure was revealed to guide people into all truth; its clear revelations guide out of darkness and superstition and eliminate want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and mental enlightenment, and its precepts are the standard to judge right or wrong. Therefore, he who grasps sight of the birth of the moon shall begin to fast. But he who is sick or proceeding on a journey shall fast the same number of days at a later time. Allah purposes to put you at ease and not make you experience discomfort. He wants you to complete the course of fasting so that you praise Allah and extol His glorious attributes for His guidance to the path of righteousness and that you may hopefully impel yourselves to feel gratitude
Should My servants call upon you, O Muhammad, for informing them about My attributes, then emphatically express that I am in their immediate proximity; I respond favourably to the humble petitioner’s prayer when he addresses Me. But those who aim for My blessings are expected to raise their internal consciousness, responding favourably to My system of faith and worship and believe in Me with faithful hearts, that they may hopefully be guided to the path of righteousness
It is lawful for you to approach your wives if you will at night when not fasting following sunset, between breakfast and dawn. As fitting garments, you are mutual sources of comfort. Allah knows your instinct, a source of self- deceit, and in His infinite mercy He gave up resentment toward you and pardoned your offence. Therefore, now you may feel free to approach them following the statutes ordained by Allah with pure hearts and minds, and you may eat and drink until you can distinguish between the black thread of night and the silver streak of dawn, and thenceforth you fast until darkness prevails at the close of daylight. refrain at all times from intimacy and emotions exciting your carnal desire While in retreat in the mosques exercising religious devotion. These are the limitations imposed by Allah, therefore, confine yourselves within them. Thus, Allah expresses His revelations to people with distinct apprehension of all involved, so that they may hopefully learn self-restraint in reverence dutiful to Him
And do not usurp others’ possessions unlawfully and present bribes to their judges to sway their discernment so that you sinfully devour a part of peoples’ possessions being aware of your evil doings
They call upon you, O Muhammad, to inform them about the new moons. Say to them: "It is one aspect of the varying appearances of the moon according to the extent of its luminosity indicating the point and passage of time in which the sequence of events take place in the material universe, and for estimating the point of time when AL-Hajj to Allah’s Sacred House is performed." You people must realize that it is not in conformity with conduct to the divine and moral law nor with righteous living that you irrationally enter the houses from the back doors, this is an irreligious notion*. It confers with divine and moral law to enter the houses from the front doors. And see that you lift to Allah your inward sight so that heaven may prosper you
And make the heart of your purpose to fight those who wage war against you in Allah’s cause, but do not initiate transgression; Allah dislikes those who go beyond the limits prescribed by Him
Kill them wherever you find them, and put them to death, and drive them out; since persecution for creed or opinion is worse than murder. But do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there and if they do, then kill them, for such action receives invites commensurate consequences; the punishment of those who deny faith
But if they discontinue hostilities and conform their will to Allah's, then they shall find that Allah is indeed Ghafurun, and Rahimun
And fight them until persecution ends and agreement is reached and Allah's system of faith prevails, recognizing Allah and His control of destiny, His rightful claim to obedience, reverence and worship. Therefore, if they cease their hostilities and conform their will to Allah's will, then restrict your hostilities only to the oppressors
If they fight you during a sacred month, then retaliate during the sacred month, and breaking the solemn observances permits reciprocity. And if they transgress against you and break Allah's command, then lay their transgression to their charge and trespass against them to the same extent and revere Allah, and realize that He upholds those who restrain themselves in reverence to Him
And let reverence move you to spend in Allah’s cause and do not cast yourselves into ruin with your own hands, and imprint your deeds with wisdom and piety, for Allah likes those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence
And complete the rites of the pilgrimage and of the Umra ( minor pilgrimage) if you had started them unless your course has been obstructed by your enemies or you have fallen sick . Under the circumstances, you shall present whatever offering you can get with ease as a complement of your journey of devotion to Allah. And do not shave your heads or shorten your hair before the offering has reached its destination (the Sacred Mosque) and has been sacrificed and distributed among the poor. But in the web of these circumstances, the sacrifice is made where you are. And he who is sick or suffers an ailment of his scalp is absolved to change the order of succession; he may shave his head or shorten his hair before, providing he makes reparation for it; he may fast for three days (in the usual manner from the break of dawn till sunset) or feed six indigent persons or sacrifice an offering and distribute it among the poor. But under peaceful conditions, he who makes the minor pilgrimage (Umra) and wishes with contentment to remain in the holy precincts onward till pilgrimage, shall be obliged to present an offering such as he can afford. But if he cannot find the suitable object to offer or he does not have the means, then he shall fast three days while in Maccah and seven days on returning home, summing ten days in all. This is a duty incumbent only on him whose family does not reside within the environs of the ka'ba (Sacred Mosque). And regard Allah with veneration and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and do realize that Allah punishes severely
The rites of the Hajj are observed during certain fixed, known months ending in the primary devotion of the first ten days of Zu AL-Hijja when Hajj to Ka’ba is made and chief rites are commonly observed. Therefore, he who takes upon himself to make Hajj, whether throughout the whole period or only at the end part of it, shall not engage in worldly matters until all religious devotional rites have been performed. No sexual congress, indecencies, nor wrangling are permitted during AL-Hajj, and whatever good deed you do shall come to Allah's knowledge. And fit out yourselves with what is necessary for the purpose, but the best provision indeed is piety, and revere Me, O you people of understanding
You are absolved to trade for livelihood betaking yourselves to Providence for His bounty. And when you throng back from Mount 'Arafat then praise Allah thankfully at the Sacred Mount –Muzdalifa- and thankfully extoll His glorious attributes for steering you to the path of righteousness although initially you were lost in the maze of error
And you people who fall short of performing AL- Hajj, of observing the final rites at Mount Muzdalifa instead of Mount 'Arafat through selfish motives, it is mandatory that you pour down from Mount 'Arafat from where people go the pace to spare the inconvenience, and invoke Allah's forgiveness; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun indeed
And when you have concluded your religious devotions and rites of AL- hajj, then praise Allah and extol His glorious attributes as you customarily praised your forefathers in pagan times, but Allah’s praises and glorious attributes should be extolled from one’s heart and innermost being. Nonetheless, among people are those whose thoughts are set upon the mundane of this world; they invoke Allah to bestow upon them life’s comforts to satisfy their enjoyment and content, and consequently never shall such persons have a share in the Hereafter
There are also others whose thoughts are upon both this world and the world to come. They invoke Allah to bestow upon them His efficacious grace here and Hereafter and to save their bodies and minds from suffering inflicted by the Fire
Such persons shall be apportioned the reward they merit for their deeds. Allah is swift indeed in executing the law
And exercise your minds in devotion and in meditation on three specific days following the conclusion of AL-Hajj when AL-Shaytan is pelted with stones in the valley of Mina. As this is optional, you incur no blame if you should leave Macca two days before or after the due date if you sincerely venerate Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and faithfully realize that to Him shall you be thronged
Among people there exists he who attracts you, drawing your interest and affection, and he conveys virtues of nature and to this end Allah is his witness, while in reality he is the worst adversary seeking to obtain his own end
When he turns his back and leaves or if he is in a position of influence over the conduct of others, he aims to exercise inherent mischief creating discord, and thus, reduces crops and cattle to ruins, contrary to Allah’s blessed word and ordinance Who detests physical and moral mischief
When he is told to revere Allah, he exaggerates displaying inordinate self confidence and is proud of inequity. This is he who best deserves malignancy and the abode in Hell, and how evil is the destination
Among people there is he who would gladly disavow the world in the cause of Allah, Who is the core of his purpose and the source of goodness, sympathy and kindness to His servants
O you people whose hearts truly believe, enter into friendly relations with one another and promote Allah’s requirement of peace and virtuous order and do not follow AL-Shaytan’s footsteps nor walk in the footsteps of those with AL- Shaytan’s characteristics; he is indeed your avowed enemy
And should you fall away from faith and practice or retreat into error after being guided into illumination and mental enlightenment, then you must realize that Allah is Azizun ( Almighty), and Hakimun (wisdom is one of His attributes) indeed
Do the unbelievers intend to wait until they distinctly perceive Allah and His angels descending, shaded under a canopy of clouds before they would conform to His blessed will? But when this matter comes to pass, the final Judgement will have been pronounced. To Him, the Ultimate Authority, all affairs, considered for decision, are submitted and executed here and in the Hereafter
Ask Bani Isra‘il, how many clear signs We imparted to them, signs guiding out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and mental enlightenment! And he who distorts divine favour conferred upon him shall realize that Allah punishes severely
Life here has eluded the eyes and minds of those who embrace their irreverent conviction and speak in derision of the believers. But those who revere Allah shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection, distinguished with eminence. Allah provides livelihood and merits whom He will with the necessary means without measure
Mankind was a single ‘Ummah (Nation) of common descent occupying a definite territory. By natural generation, numbers multiplied and were scattered in various directions and became disunited emotionally and mentally. There and then Allah sent Prophets as a spectacle and warning to all. He equipped them with the Book of Truth guiding into all truth in order to judge between people regarding issues of reason. Yet those who disputed its precepts were the same who were given the Book (Ahl Al-Kitab) imparting enough signs guiding them into illumination and mental enlightenment. But they were no longer disposed to the truth due to their mutual enmity and malignant intention. Nonetheless, Allah will guide the truth-seeking believers to His path. Allah guides whom He will to the path of righteousness
Or did you people who conformed to Islam think you would qualify to reside in Paradise before enduring hardship and trials determining your real qualities of endurance and inclination, trials similar to your predecessors’ subjection! They were so stricken by misfortunes and calamities that they trembled and quaked in fear to the point that the Prophet himself and those in his line expressed their thoughts: "When shall Allah’s promised victory come to pass?" Allah’s assistance is indeed near; He is the relief for such persons when in trouble
They ask you, O Muhammad, what they should spend and to whose benefit. Say to them: spend in benevolence of whatever you righteously earned and regard the prior claims of family ties naturally owed to parents and kin and out of humanitarian duty owed to orphans and the needy and to those lacking means of transportation and journey on foot. And whatever divine deed you do shall come to Allah’s awareness
O you Muslims: as much as you dislike fighting, it is nonetheless, a prescriptive rule decreed as duty and moral obligation to defend your faith and to repel your enemy. It may happen that you dislike something and it proves beneficial to you and it may also happen that you like something and it proves harmful to you; Allah is Alimun but you are not
They call upon you, O Muhammad, for information and a reply relative to the question of fighting during the Sacred Month. Say to them: "Fighting during the Sacred Month is a grave offence and obstruction to Allah’s spirit of truth guiding people into all truth and an emphatic denial of the Sacred Mosque and the month's sanctity. And expulsion of Allah’s devotees from whence is a major offence to Allah and persecution for creed or opinion is worse than murder. The idolaters will continue to fight you until they succeed in forcing you to renounce your religion if they can. And he who turns renegade among you and dies captivated in disbelief and such persons shall be inherent losers; their hope shall be disappointed and their deeds shall be worthless here and Hereafter; it is these who shall be claimed by Hell and therein shall they remain forever
Those who truly believed in Allah to the extent that they quit their homes and towns to settle where they could best serve Allah’s purpose and strive in His cause, justly expect Allah’s mercy and blessings, and Allah is -Ghafurun and Rahimun. Two questions arise, one concerning intoxicants and gambling, the answer of which is partly given below and partly in chapters Four and Five according to relevancy. The other question concerns spending money benevolently and the answer here relates to the amount and the degree
They ask you, O Muhammad, about intoxicants and gambling. Say to them: "They both involve a major sin as well as some advantages, but their evil outweighs their advantages." And they ask you how to spend in benevolence! Say to them: "Spend in benevolence and benefaction of what you can spare in excess of your actual requirements." Thus, Allah elucidates to you people His revelations and ordinances that you may hopefully consider the consequences
They contemplate their awareness of life here and in the Hereafter. and they call upon you, O Muhammad, to inform them about Islam and its position on orphans. Say to them: "Put an end to abuses and disorder and adopt the right course of reformation, it is better for them, and if you reverently commune and conduct interchanges, they are your brothers in faith. Allah knows well the one who is playfully malicious and the one who faithfully seeks reform. Had Allah willed, He would have afflicted you with difficulties; Allah is Azizun (Almighty) and Hakimun
Do not join idolaters in wedlock before they believe in Allah, their Creator, with true faith. Indeed, a slave who believes in Allah is far better than an idolater even if adorned with qualities attracting your love; nor should you allow your women to join idolaters in wedlock before believing in Allah with spiritual faith; indeed, a slave who believes in Allah is far better than an idolater even if adorned with qualities attracting your love. These idolaters influence your actions and deeds and you will end in the Fire, whereas Allah graciously attracts you to settle in His Paradise, and enjoy His forgiveness. Allah explicates to people His revelations that they may hopefully open their minds’ eyes
They ask you, O Muhammad, for information relative to women's menstruation and whether sexual congress is permissible in its duration. Say to them: "It is an unwholesome phase in the woman's menstrual cycle fraught with systemic changes including personality alteration and a general decrease in resistance to disease. Therefore, leave women alone during menstruation and do not approach them until they are clear of it and have cleansed. When once they are ritually conditioned, you may feel free to approach them in the manner Allah has ordained. Allah likes those who in lowliest plight repentant stand and those who free themselves of physical, moral and spiritual defilement
Your wives are where you cultivate your crop of posterity; they are your field wherein you cultivate mutual affection and emotion directed to attaining pleasure or satisfaction, therefore, till your tilth virtuously as you will and advance piety toward future security and revere Allah. And realise that you are destined to be in His August Presence Hereafter, and announce blissful tidings, O Muhammad, to those touched by the divine hand
And do not abuse Allah’s Eternal Name in acts of swearing when referring to Allah in binding you to a false statement or an act or in refusing to make peace. Make reparations for your oath and correct the incorrect so that reputations are maintained and piety is credited for the sake of reverence and the ability to create peace among people, and your affirmation is as sacred as an oath. Revere Allah; Who is Sami’un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and 'Alimun
Allah excuses you for oaths in which the guilt does not reside in the intention, but He holds you responsible for oaths with guilty intention and Allah is, Ghafurun and Hakimun (Forbearing toward His creatures)
And those of you who make an oath to abstain from approaching your wives must not exceed four months. Should they reconcile with their own hearts and with Allah thereby resuming their normal relationship, they shall find Allah Ghafurun and Rahimun
However, if they should decide to divorce, Allah is Sami‘un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and 'Alimun
Divorced women shall remain for three months, or menstrual cycles, in order to regard their condition. They are not absolved to hide Allah’s creation in their wombs if they are true believers. There and then their husbands shall have prior entitlement to reclaiming them and resuming marital life if both agree to reconciliation. And women have as many rights as equal obligations, and men are a step higher than they are in the scope of responsibility, and Allah is Azizun and Hakimun
Divorce is permissible only twice, if each time both parties think they can reconcile with their hearts and with Allah. There and then they shall have to hold together in equity or else part in kindness. But if you decide on divorce, then you are forbidden to reclaim what you gave them of dower or gifts unless you fear obstinacy against Allah’s ordinances, then you are absolved if she wishes to buy her freedom. These are the limitations imposed by Allah, and those who transgress them are wrongful
If he happens to divorce her and reclaim her twice and then divorces her again a third time, then he has no right to reclaim her in wedlock, that is if they both are so inclined, before joining another man in wedlock. If the second husband willingly divorces her, then and only then, are they absolved to reunite in wedlock if they both believe they are able to honour the limitations imposed by Allah. These are the limitations imposed by Allah; He clearly explicates them to those who reflect
When you have divorced women and they have fulfilled their determined period of waiting for three months and both of you are willing to reconcile, then you either reclaim them in equity and honour or free them in equity and honour. Do not reclaim them for a selfish end or spite them and he who acts in this manner will wrong himself. And do not mock Allah’s revelations and statutes, and render solemn acknowledgement of Allah’s divine favour conferred upon you and revere the Book He sent down to you and the knowledge and wisdom He imparted to you to caution you to commendable conduct, and revere Allah, and realise that Allah is 'Alimun of all
And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled their determined period of waiting, do not restrain them, O you who have influence, from reuniting with their separated husbands in wedlock if the women wish to reconcile their quarrel in equity and honour. This is an appeal incumbent on those who believe in Allah and in the Last Day with truly faithful hearts. This imparts sanctity to you and you become pious, for Allah is 'Alimun whereas you are not
Mothers who have given birth shall suckle their babies for a period of two years if deemed necessary to complete the course of breast-feeding. It is incumbent on the child’s father, whether normally married or in the process of a divorce to provide both mother and infant with the means of subsistence and life’s necessities and provide them with clothing according to his means, in equity and honour. No soul is charged with spending except within the means. Nor should a mother or father suffer on account of their child. And in the case of the father’s death, the heir shall be charged with the same responsibility. If both parents wish to interrupt breast-feeding in the infant’s interest and decide to wean, they may do so. If it be deemed necessary to engage a wet nurse to breast-feed the child, you may do so on the condition that the mother or the wet nurse are not denied their due. revere Allah and realise that Allah is Bassirun, He sees all you do
And in the event of a husband’s death, bereaved widows shall wait for a determined period of four months and ten days without any expectation other than the possibility of pregnancy, inevitably shaping the course of events. When the determined period of waiting has expired, those of you of influence are absolved of their inclinations as long as they are equitably and honourably disposed, and Allah is Khabirun (Omniscient) of all you do
You men incur no consequence if, at this time, you ethically and indirectly advance your marriage offer for consideration, or if you only entertain the idea or cling to hope. Allah knows well that attraction to women is natural to you and that you think about them. But do not secretly propose to them during this determined period, but you may hold honourable conversation with them. Nor can you enter into a marriage contract until the determined period has been fulfilled. You ought to realise that Allah knows what is hidden in your innermost being, therefore, beware of Him and be cautious and realise that He is Ghafurun and Halimun (Indulgent and Forbearing)
You incur no blame if you divorce women before consummating the marriage and before deciding on dower's payment or its amount. But in order to do equity and justice you shall compensate them for disappointing their expectations; the wealthy, according to his means and the restrained, within his means, an expression of good will affording pleasure. This is a duty incumbent on those whose deeds are wise and pious
And if you divorce them before consummating marriage but after already deciding on the dower’s amount, then they are entitled to half the determined amount unless they themselves, or their representatives, grant remission of the due amount. And to grant remission is nearer to piety. Do not forget to exercise good will among each other and to commit generosity, for the actions of men are the best interpreters of their thoughts. Allah is Bassirun, He sees all you do
Observe your duty to Allah and maintain the prescribed prayers, especially AL-‘Asr, the afternoon prayer, and humble yourselves to Allah and exercise unqualified obedience to Him
And if you experience uneasiness caused by danger, you may perform your prayers on foot while walking or riding. But when normal conditions resume and safety prevails, then perform your prayers in the manner instructed by Allah Who made known to you what you never knew
Those of you who feel death approaching shall bequeath to their wives the means of sustenance for a period of one year, and in case of sudden death the heir is charged with the same responsibility. In either case, the widow shall remain in his residence for the same period of one year. But should the widows choose to change their residence voluntarily after fulfilling the determined period of four months and ten days, then you incur no consequence for what they do with themselves as long as they are equitably and honourably disposed; Allah is Azizun and Hakimun
And women who have been judicially separated from their husbands whether before or after consummation of marriage are also entitled to a reasonable endowment as separate maintenance, a gesture to those whose expectation they disappointed. This is a duty incumbent on those who do equity, reverence and justice and exhibit veneration for Allah
Thus, Allah explicates to you people His revelations that you may hopefully reflect
Have you not seen, O Muhammad, into the event of those who fled their dwellings by the thousands in the face of hostility from the enemy of faith in fear of death? Consequently, Allah pronounced them dead and their hopes died as well. Then in mercy He revived their hopes and infused renewed life into them. Indeed, Allah’s efficacious grace abounds in people but most of them show no gratitude nor do their hearts surge, responding thankfully
Therefore, fight in Allah’s cause and make it the core of your purpose, and realise that Allah is Sami‘un and 'Alimun
Who would like to lend Allah all the benevolence and pious deeds he can toward future security and Allah shall reimburse him multi-fold! Allah is He Who reduces to poverty causing want, and He also brings abundance and supplying want, and back to Him shall all of you return
Have you not seen, O Muhammad, into the discourse held by Bani Isra‘il’s chiefs with a prophet of their own sent to them after Mussa’s death? They said to him: "Nominate a king under whose power we can unite and fight in Allah’s cause." The Prophet said to them: "What if he is appointed and fighting is ordained and you refuse to fight?" They said: "But why should we not fight in Allah’s cause when we and our children have been expelled from our homes?" But when fighting was ordained they retracted their word and their true irreverent spirit betrayed them to their fall excepting a few; but Allah is wholly aware of the wrongful
Their prophet then said to them: "Now Allah appointed Talut (Saul) as your king." But they said: "How can he be given sovereignty over us when we claim priority in birth, rank and dignity and he is not as endowed with possessions and advantages!" Their prophet said: "Allah has chosen him to reign over you and has imparted to him a wealth of knowledge and privileged him with a distinguished stature, and Allah delegates His Authority to whom He will. Allah is Wasi‘un (Omnipresent) and 'Alimun
Their prophet then said to them: "His delegated Authority is evidenced in the reclamation of the Ark of the Covenant, once lost to the enemy, carried by the angels with security provided by Allah, your Creator, and comprising of the relics abandoned by Mussa’s family and Harun’s family." "This incident," he added, "surely represents convincing divine evidence of Allah’s delegated Authority to Talut, which should be acceptable to you if indeed you are true believers
And when Talut advanced his troops and traversed some distance by marching, they came across a river. There and then said Talut to his troops: "Allah has preordained that you be tested now for inclination, sincerity and endurance, therefore, he who drinks of the river to satisfy his thirst shall be discharged from my forces, but he who does not drink shall join my forces, but excused is he who takes only a few sips from the palm of one hand. Yet they all satisfied their thirst except for a few. And when Talut crossed the river with those who exercised unqualified obedience to commands, they wrere confronted by Jalut (Goliath) and his superior forces whom they feared. They said: "On this day we are not a match for Jalut and his forces. But those who marched under the banner, believers touched by the divine hand, who believe they would be destined to be in Allah, the Creator’s, August Presence Hereafter, ventured to say: "How often, Allah willing, has a small force submitted a superior force?" Allah upholds the patient and persevering
When they faced Jalut and his forces they prayed: "inspire us, O Allah, our Creator, to be justly confident and enduring and inspire our courage and help us make our steps firm, and bring victory and fortune to us so that we reduce those who deny You to ruin
And so, they routed Jalut’s forces as Allah willed, and Dawud (David), then, a poor shepherd and unarmed youth) slew Jalut, and by His grace, Allah conferred authority, sovereignty and wisdom upon him and imparted upon him the knowledge He willed. And if Allah did not repress some people through others, indeed, the world would be full of mischief, but Allah’s grace abounds in the universe
These are Allah’s revelations, We relate them to you, O Muhammad, in truth, for you are one of the Prophets
We endowed such Prophets with privileges, some more than others. Among them was one spoken to by Allah, and He evaluated some a degree higher in rank. And We sent ‘Isa, son of Maryam, with clear revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and mental enlightenment, and We supported him giving him countenance by the Holy Spirit, Jibril. And had Allah willed, never would have their successors fought against each other, especially after receiving intellectual enlightenment and mental illumination. But they were at variance in a state of discord and enmity, some recognising Allah and obeying His statutes and others denying Him or rejecting His ordinances and decrees. And had Allah willed they would not have warred against each other, but Allah does and enacts what He will
O you whose hearts truly believe, spend benevolently and with benefaction in Allah’s cause before the Day arrives when no buying nor selling shall be effected. Nor shall friendship alleviate him, whoever he may be, nor shall anyone be permitted to intercede on behalf of another, and Allah’s deniers shall be the wrongful
Allah, there is no Ilah but He, The Eternal, the Absolute, Purveyor of sustenance for all, and AL-Qayum (Omnipotent) Who preserves existence. It is not congruous with His divine nature to slumber or sleep. To Him belong all in the heavens and on earth. Who is it Who can intercede on behalf of another in His August Presence but by the graceful proclamation of His permission? He knows His creatures’ experiences and the course of coming events which bridge their span and no one can comprehend anything of His knowledge nor can anything be known except as He will. His Throne, His knowledge and His dominance and command extend over the heavens and earth, whose preservation does not tire Him or worn out with fatigue, and He is above all and beyond all, He is the Unique, whose attributes belong to the highest regions of thought and reality
Compulsion is incompatible with religion, therefore let there be no compulsion in religion. Now the path of righteousness has been distinguished from the path of error and holiness distinguished from vindictiveness. Therefore, he who rejects false beliefs and turns his attention to Allah with a religious mind, will have firmly grasped the eternal, unchangeable and most secure handhold which shall never separate, nor shall it suffer a break, and Allah is Sami‘un and 'Alimun
Allah is the Guardian of those whose hearts truly believe spiritually. He guides them out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual vision into illumination and mental enlightenment, whereas those who denied Allah are guided by the prince of darkness, or by those with Satanic characteristics, leading them out of light and driving them into darkness and want of spiritual and intellectual vision. Such persons shall be the inmates of Hell fire, their eternal abode
Have you not seen, O Muhammad, into the discourse of the one who argued with Ibrahim against Allah, his Creator, only because he was in a position of power over the kingdom bequeathed to his sovereignty by Allah? Ibrahim said: "Allah is my Creator, He who gives life and determines the moment of death." The man said: "I as well grant life and occasion death." Then Ibrahim said: "Allah causes the sun to rise in the east, so then, cause it to rise from the west." And there the presumptuous infidel was thrown into confusion and defeat, and Allah does not guide the wrongful to His path of righteousness
Or, similarly, his similitude to the one who passed by a town (AL-Quds) which was empty of life and he could see nothing but the remains of decayed and fallen buildings. Then he exclaimed: "How shall Allah restore it and revitalise it after having suffered death and total destruction?" There and then Allah occasioned his death lasting a hundred years and then brought him back to life and asked him: "How long do you think you have been in death’s repose?" The man said: "In all probability a day or even less in all." "But," said Allah, "you have been in death’s repose for a hundred years, and now look at your food and drink, none of them decomposed, and look at your donkey and see how it shattered into fragments of bones. We will make you a miraculous sign demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority. And now regard the bones and see how We construct them and clothe them in flesh." And when the man witnessed Allah’s Omnipotence and Authority, he said: "Now I realise that Allah is Qadirun over all things
And Ibrahim spoke to Allah and said: "O Allah, my Creator, show me how you bring the dead back to life!" Allah said: "Do you not assent to the truth of Resurrection?" "Indeed I do," said Ibrahim, "this is not to satisfy doubts but to satisfy my reason and heart and become a better man." "Then," said Allah, "take four birds and train them to get accustomed to you. Then, "Tie them, kill them, cut them into pieces, then place each piece on a different hill, and call them to you and they shall swiftly take wing, and this should cause you to realise that Allah is indeed Azizun and Hakimun
The example of those who spend of their wealth in divine service is similar to sown individual grains of corn growing seven auricles, each auricle carrying a hundred grains. And Allah thankfully reimburses multi-fold to whom He will, and Allah is Wasi‘un, His grace abounds in the universe, and He is Alimun
Those who spend of their wealth in divine service and do not later remind the recipient reproachfully of past favours contributing to his mental anguish shall receive their reward in heaven, they shall have no basis for alarm nor shall fear or dread fall upon them nor shall they grieve
In fact, a kind word of friendliness and forgiveness is far better than benevolence followed by reproach inducing mental anguish, and Allah is Independent, Ghaniyun (Absolute) and Halimun
O you whose hearts truly believe: Do not cancel the divine reward you merit for your benevolence by the reminders of your generosity or inducing mental anguish. You are then like he who spends his wealth ostentatiously under the guise of benevolence only to attract attention and win people’s admiration while truthfully, he believes neither in Allah nor in the Last Day. His similitude is that of a rock covered with dust and fertile soil which has been exposed to torrential rain stripping it of its soil leaving it completely bare. Such persons have lost; unable to reclaim anything they had falsely earned. And Allah does not guide those who deny Him to His path of righteousness
The example of those who spend their wealth in divine service acting upon inspiration and stronger volition than their own, is comparable to an orchard at a high elevation with rich subsoil. The orchard is exposed to torrential rain effecting a yield double its normal produce. And in the absence of torrential rain it catches the moisture of the early morning and the light showers drifting down the valley. And Allah is Alimun of all you do
Would any of you like to have an orchard of date palms and vines, and rivers streaming beneath it providing him with diversified fruit trees, and when he advances in age and his progeny are still young or feeble, the orchard is struck by a fiery whirlwind? Thus, Allah explicates to you people His revelations and He makes His signs obvious to the senses that you may hopefully ponder
O you whose hearts have been touched by the divine hand, spend of the lawful and virtuous things you have earned and of the earth’s fruits We produced for you, and do not select corrupt returns for devotion to Allah and dispose of it benevolently if you yourselves would reluctantly accept it and would shut your eyes to it if unable to help. And Allah is Independent, Ghaniyun; His grace abounds in the universe, Worthy of all Praise
AL-Shaytan deceives your judgement in order to cause falsity to be accepted as true, he threatens you with poverty in consequence for spending in divine service and he portrays to you what would insidiously allure your minds’ eyes and tempt you to commit morally evil acts whereas Allah promises you forgiveness from heaven’s realm and confers upon you efficacious grace. And Allah is Wasi‘un, His grace abounds in the universe, He is Alimun
Allah confers sound judgement in choosing means and ends upon whom He will and acquaints his heart and innermost being with wisdom and wise dispensations, and he who is gifted with this divine attribute, has indeed been endowed with overflowing goodness, and all grace will abound in him. But no one reflects except those with intellectual power of perception to know, remember and judge
And whatever large or small amount you spend in divine service or whatever you vow to solemnly undertake, comes to Allah’s knowledge. And the wrongful shall have no guiding protectors to help them Hereafter
If you perform benevolent acts openly with good will and a clean heart, it is meritorious. But if you conceal your charitable acts when you offer in benevolence to the needy, it is better for you; such acts expiate some of your wrongs by benefits, and Allah is 'Alimun of All that you do
It is not your responsibility, Muhammad, to guide the strayed to the path of righteousness but it is Allah Who touches the hearts of whom He will with His divine hand opening their minds’ eyes to His path of righteousness. And whatever you spend in divine service reflects piety in your deeds and it is but an advantage to you, that is if what you spend is truly intended to fulfil your obligation to Allah and to satisfy your conscience and hearts. And whatever you spend in benevolence shall be reimbursed in your favour and you shall not be wronged
Among you are those who truly deserve benefaction; they have been restrained from earning their livelihood because they participated in the war of belief against unbelief. They keep up appearances exhibiting to those unacquainted with them a happy expression and satisfaction because their modesty obstructs their tongues. You know them by their appearance speaking a different language; they do not solicit peoples’ ears for charity. And whatever you spend in divine service comes to Allah’s Knowledge
Those who spend of their wealth day and night in divine service of containing their souls, whether they do it covertly or overtly shall be merited in heaven’s realm; they shall have no basis for alarm nor shall fear or dread fall upon them nor shall they grieve
Those who have such a voracious appetite that they indifferently devour all they can gain from their practice of usury are both offensive and defensive with respect to mankind and they assume the demeanour of the mentally disturbed who offer themselves to al-Shaytan who debased them mentally and spiritually. That is because they allege, "Just as trade is a means of livelihood, so is usury; it is commercial dealing." But just as Allah permitted legitimate trade and consented to industry, He utterly forbade usury. Therefore, he who bows his ears in receiving admonition from Allah, his Creator, and restrains and monitors his desires and actions, may keep the gain from the past and plead his causes and Allah mercifully decides upon them. But those who relapse into this evil practice shall be the inmates of Hell eternally
Allah denounces usury but repays charitable acts generously. And Allah does not like those who sinfully consent to the forbidden
Those who truly believe and mark their deeds with wisdom and piety and faithfully observe their act of worship and give zakat, for zakat is but the vehicle of prayer, shall be rewarded by Heaven and no fear or dread shall fall upon them nor shall they grieve
O you who have recognised Allah, revere Him and relinquish the amount owed to you in usury if your hearts are truly spiritual believers
And if you do not obey this rule of righteous life commanded by religion, nor fearing for your unlawful gain, then you must expect war between belief against unbelief waged against you by Allah and His Prophet. But if you repent, grow wiser and reform then you are entitled only to the principal, the capital sum lent, so that you do not wrong others or be wronged
And if the debtor experiences difficulty or is in a pecuniary situation, then give him respite until he is at ease and is able to return the debt. And if you are able to cancel the debt or a part thereof in benevolence, you shall merit the grace of Allah, if you only knew
And guard yourselves from the Day when you are returned to Allah and each soul shall be requited with the commensurate to its deeds, and none shall be wronged
O you with hearts touched by the divine hand, if you become involved in a debt payable at a fixed date, be it a loan, item borrowed or bought on credit or a business transaction, then commit it to writing. A scribe shall formulate an agreement or contract mediating the parties with recourse to the general principles of Allah’s justice. No scribe shall refuse to fulfil this function as Allah imparted it; he simply writes and the debtor dictates and keeps Allah in mind, and the scribe shall not decrease any of the agreed amount. Should the debtor be of unsound mind, weak, or incapable of dictating, then his guardian should dictate according to equity and good conscience. And select two of your men to be formally present as witnesses to the transaction. And if two men are unavailable, then one man and two commendable women so that later, if one errs due to a memory lapse, lack of experience or a biological factor, then the other will remind her of the correct testimony. And those who were called upon to witness the transaction and were associated with the event must not refuse when they are called in for evidence in the future. And do not be disinclined to commit the debt, small or large, to writing. Sanctioned by Allah according to judicial principles, this is recourse to a credited testimony preventing doubt. This is mandatory unless it is business involving bartered merchandise or collective management at an immediate cash rate, then you are absolved if you do not commit it to writing. But when you dispose of merchandise to a buyer for price, then such transactions must be witnessed. And neither writer nor witness should be made to suffer, for if you harm them, you commit a sin that shall be transferred to you, and revere Allah; He teaches you and shows you through information or instruction; He is 'Alimun of all in all
And if you are on a journey and cannot find a writer, then place a pledge in the creditor’s possession as a guarantee of good faith. And if the debtor considers the creditor a credible person then the creditor should prove himself trustworthy and return the pledge upon receiving the debt from the debtor, also expected to be trustworthy, and either of them should keep Allah in mind and revere Him. And do not conceal, destroy, suppress or refuse to provide evidence when summoned, and he who withholds testimony is indeed morally depraved with a soiled and sinful heart. And Allah is 'Alimun of all you do
To Allah belong all in the heavens and earth and realise that regardless of how you express yourself, in words or secretly in the mind and heart, all comes to Allah’s knowledge, and He shall judge you accordingly. He shall then extend mercy and forgiveness to whom He will and put to torment whom He will, and Allah is Qadirun to effect all things
The Prophet strongly believes in all that has been revealed to him from Allah, his Creator. He pays credence to it and embraces it as truth personified. Similarly act the true believers who revere profoundly, they believe in Allah, His spiritual angels or attendants, His books and His Messengers. And they emphatically declare: "We do not differentiate between one Prophet and another." And they beseech Allah for forgiveness with the following prayer of invocation: "We have, O Allah, heard Your message with receptive hearts and venerated Your revelations and all enjoined, and we obey all Your statutes and ordinances You decreed. O Allah, our Creator, kindly grant Your mercy and forgiveness to us; You are the end of all destiny
Allah does not charge a soul except with what it can bear; a soul shall qualify to reap the fruit it merits for its innocence and piety, and it shall pay its own debt and suffer accordingly. Therefore, beseech Him in heaven to take mercy on your souls, praying thus: "O Allah, our Creator, do not condemn us if we fail to remember, if we err innocently, if our imperfections fall short of the purpose, if we dissatisfy Your standard or neglect a duty. And present us not, O Allah, our Creator, with difficulties as the difficulties you imposed on those who came before us in consequence of their arrogance and wrongful actions." "And charge us not O Allah, our Creator, with the unbearable, pardon us, forgive us and have mercy on us; You are our Protective Guardian; help us gain advantage over those who deny you
(Alef), L. (Lam), M. (Meem); [The Surah opens with letters from the Arabic alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran, though written in the people's tongue, it cannot be emulated]
Allah, there is no Ilah but He, the Eternal, the Absolute Purveyor of sustenance for all and AL-Qayum (Omnipotent Who preserves existence)
He has revealed to you, O Muhammad, the Quran, in truth and in agreement with reality, corroborating and authoritatively validating the authentic books previously revealed, and in temporal order He revealed AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil (the Torah and the Bible)
All Scriptures were revealed earlier in the spirit of truth in order to guide people into all truth yet people set themselves at variance to them. So there came the Quran that is the standard and the canon illuminating the intellect and imparting the soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends and in the choice of what is morally good, honest and straightforward. It guides into illumination and enlightenment. Therefore, those who disregard Allah’s revelations and signs that He makes obvious to the senses, shall suffer grievously. Allah is Azizun (Almighty) He justly avenges His right
There is absolutely nothing that can be hidden from Allah, be it on earth or in the heavens
He is it who forms you and fashions you inside the womb as He wills and determines the characteristics of your form and appearance. There is no Ilah but Him, AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
It is He who has revealed to you O Muhammad; the Quran with revelations that are precise and exactly defined. These constitute the essential part and the fundamental or groundwork of Allah’s system of faith and worship and unequivocal understanding and obedience from every intellectual being. Other revelations are allegorical. They describe a subject under the guise of some other comparable subject. Those with malignant and perverse hearts choose to follow only the allegories to interpret them as they please. Motivated by malice, they present the interpretation that causes dissension and includes discord when no one knows the exact interpretation but Allah. But those with well – founded knowledge, acquainted with the facts, declare their firm belief in the Quran and express their thoughts in words: "It is all disclosed by Providence." But none reflect except those with sound minds
Who express their prayer of invocation: "O Allah our Creator, we beseech You not to erase piety from our hearts after You have made us true believers and guided us to the path of righteousness. O Allah, extend to us Your mercy; it is You Who gives and it is You Who bestows gratuitously
You have ordained, O Allah, our Creator, that You shall assemble all people together to Your August presence on that inevitable Day. Blessed be Allah Who unfailingly fulfils His promise
Neither wealth nor progeny shall be of value or advantage in Day of Judgement, to those who deny Allah. Nor shall these privileges protect them from Allah; such persons shall be the fuel feeding the fire
What becomes of them compares to what had become of the people of Pharaoh and to those who preceded them who refused to recognize Our revelations and signs, evincing both Omnipotence and Authority. Consequently Allah seized them with a calamity and reduced them to a useless form in requital of their iniquities. With justness does Allah punish severely
Say O Muhammad to those infidels who deny Allah: "You shall be reduced to submission here, and be banished into Hell Hereafter. and how evil is the destined habitation
There is an intellectual and spiritual lesson to comprehend. Two forces met, one fighting in favour of Allah and the other against Allah. The pursuit of an end and the unwavering and positive stand merited the Muslims aid at the hands of Allah to the end that the enemy of faith was divinely induced to form witness a mirage of the Muslims portraying them to be twice as the enemy. Allah confirms whom He will and gives them supremacy and superiority and bestows victory. This is indeed an instructive example to those who have opened their minds’ eyes
Prompted by instinct and charged to the finger tips with life, people allured by a passion for women, to the accumulation of masses of gold and silver, to owning pedigree horses and an abundance of cattle and fertile land. All in all, these are simply the ephemeral pleasures of life below, whereas in heaven's realm pleasures are eternal and the abode is an atmosphere of rapturous delight
Say to them O Muhammad: "Shall I inform you of what excels that which allures your eyes and minds here? Paradise beneath which rivers flow is unsurpassed in beauty and supreme bliss, destined to those who revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him. They will have passed through nature to Eternity companioned by mates of their design, pure and holy, fellows of their piety. Above all they come in Allah’s grace and they win His satisfaction and esteem. Allah is Vigilant. He keeps a watchful eye upon His creation and upon the way people conduct themselves in life; He knows the attributes inherent in each and all
He knows and spiritually sustains those whose hearts have been touched by the divine hand, who are vested with the cardinal virtues, expressing their thoughts in words to pray Allah for forgiveness. Thus, they say: "O Allah, our Creator, our hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, we pray and beseech You to forgive our iniquities and ensure our immunity from the fire
It is they who are patient and unwearied in the face of difficulties, who habitually tell the truth with their words and their deeds. It is they who are obedient and submissive to the will of Allah, who are charitable in divine service and the devout who pray to Allah and beseech His forgiveness far into the night and before the day dawns
Allah’s unique creation corroborates His statement that there is no Ilah but Him and to this effect, the angels and the knowledgeable attest. He exercises His authority and power in maintenance and vindication of right by reward or punishment. There is no Ilah but Him, AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim
The religion, the system of faith and worship, commended by Allah is Islam or the recognition on the part of man of Allah’s Omnipotence and Authority and His power to control destiny besides acceptance of this feeling as a standard of spiritual and practical life. Yet not until they had received the divine discourse and intellectual acquaintance of the truth did Ahl al-Kitab fall into dispute and become divided through mutual envy and ill intention. He who disregards Allah’s revelations and visible signs shall find that Allah is indeed swift in putting the law in execution
Should Ahl al-Kitab argue with you, O Muhammad, and maintain their irreverent position by adducing their unfounded reasons, then say to them: "I have vowed to resign myself to Allah’s purpose and I have conformed my will and my reason to His blessed will. So have those who fell into line with me." Say to them and to the illiterates: "Are you now satisfied with what you heard and have your doubts been satisfied? If you are, then conform to Islam". If they do, then they are on the path of righteousness, but should they turn a deaf ear and their hearts cannot hear the truth, you are only responsible for relating the message. Allah keeps a watchful eye upon His creation and upon the way people conduct themselves in life and He knows the attributes inherent in each and all
Indeed those who disregard Allah’s revelations and visible signs and in defiance of Allah wrongfully kill His Prophets and those who enjoin righteousness, they shall be miserably disappointed of their expectations. Announce to them, O Muhammad, the coming of a grievous punishment
These are they whose deeds and moral actions shall come to be devoid of value here and Hereafter, and no one shall afford them help
Have you not seen, O Muhammad, the disposition of those who had their share of the Book and divine knowledge, how evasive they are! When the Quran is chosen as the arbiter in a dispute to settle all matters of difference, some of them pay no attention
They imagine falsely and then exclaim: "Fire will not touch us but for a certain number of days." They attribute this forgery to their religion, and consequently deceived their own mind's eyes
So how will they react when We assemble them on the inevitable Day when each soul shall be requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and they shall not be wronged
Advance the glory of Allah and extol and magnify Him with praise. O Prophet exclaim: "Allah Who has the absolute Sovereign Authority over the universe with all its realms, You confer sovereignty on whom You will and You divest it from whom You will. You ennoble whom You will and You humiliate whom You will. On the helm of Your hand rests goodness. You are Qadirun (Omnipotent) wholly capable of doing all things
You cause the night to lose itself by absorption into the day and You cause the day to lose itself by absorption into the night, irrespective of the nature of the solar day, civil day or the period of the year. You cause the living to ascend from the dead* and You cause the dead to fall from life. You provide livelihood and You fit out meritoriously whom You will with what You will and with what is necessary for a certain purpose
Belief is incompatible with Disbelief, therefore let those whose hearts have been touched by the divine hand refrain from favouring those infidels who deny Allah over their companions in religion. He who follows this irreverent course of action, Allah shall renounce, except under compelling circumstances, then exercise caution beforehand to provide against their mischief. Allah cautions you not to come within the measure of His wrath. Allah is the end and purpose for which all are destined
Say to them: "Whether you conceal your thoughts and feelings and what your hearts forge, or you express them loudly or under your breath, all comes to Allah’s knowledge and He knows all that is in the heavens and on earth. He is Qadirun over all things
The day shall come when every soul shall be presented in the August presence with a vivid picture of the deeds imprinted in life with wisdom and piety, and with a written description of the evil that was wrought by want of thought, from which evil, the soul shall wish it was as far from as the earth's distant ends. Allah cautions you not to come within the measure of His wrath. Allah is the source of goodness, sympathy and kindness to His servants
Say to them all, O Muhammad: "If you people truly entertain a great love for Allah and you look upon Him as the heart of your purpose, then follow me. Then Allah shall confer on you His grace and blessings, and find forgiveness for your iniquities. Allah is Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun
Say to them: "Be obedient to Allah and to His Messenger, but if they turn a deaf ear then they must realize that Allah detests the infidels who deny Him
Allah has taken by preference Adam and Nuh (Noah), the family of Ibrahim and the family of ‘Imran out of all people and conferred on them the prerogative of Prophethood
A posterity that descended one from the other. Allah is Sami’un (All Hearing) and 'Alimun (Omniscient)
Once when the wife of ‘Imran became aware that a child whom she thought was a male had been created in her womb, she made a solemn and humble request to Allah to accept her offering. She prayed: "O Allah, my Creator, I have solemnly consecrated to You the child in my womb who shall be disposed exclusively to Your special service, and here do I beseech You to accept my offering. You are AL-Sami’ and AL-'Alim
When she gave birth to the child, she was astonished, even though Allah already knew well what she had brought forth, she said: "O Allah, my Creator, I am delivered of a female. I have called her Maryam and here do I commit her and her progeny to You to protect them from AL-Shaytan and those with characteristics befitting him, the accursed and the outcast
The offering was met with a favourable reception and Allah, her Creator, received her with favour and under His tutelage she grew in grace and piety. She grew to a place of incomparable honour and Zakariya (Zakariah) fostered her. Every time Zakariya entered into her chamber in the Temple, he found her well provisioned. He asked: "O Maryam, from which source do you get this unprecedented provision?" "It is from Allah", she said, "Indeed Allah provides livelihood and fits out meritoriously whom He will with what He will and with what he deems necessary for a certain purpose
There and then did Zakariya pray and beseech Allah, his Creator; he said: "O Allah, my Creator, may I make a humble request to You to bestow on me from Your grace a pious posterity, You are AL-Sami’ so You hear the prayer
His prayer was met with quite an unexpected and most favourable divine response. The angels addressed him while he was at his devotions, performing his prayer in the Temple. "O Zakariya," they said, "Here we relate to you a divine edict. Allah intimates to you the announcement of a happy event; the arrival of a male child to be called Yahya (John). His birth shall verify that a word from Allah is all that it takes for anything material or immaterial to be and to have a place in the realm of fact. He will be a son who shall be great and illustrious, spiritually attached to Allah and a virtuous Prophet whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
Zakariya vented his surprise in an exclamation, he asked: "O Allah, my Creator, how shall I have a son when I have been carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life and my wife has always been barren?" He was told, "Thus does Allah accomplish what He will
Zakariya added: "May I be given, O Allah, my Creator, a sign that would satisfy my reason." He was told "What serves to indicate the fact shall be your inability to talk to people for three days. You shall be able to communicate with them only by making signs. Meanwhile praise Allah frequently and glorify Him and extol His glorious attributes in the evening and in the early morning
The angels addressed Maryam. They said "O Maryam, Allah has chosen you for an unexpected event. You are so pure that He has taken you by preference out of all the women of all nations
O Maryam, be obedient and submissive to the will of Allah and bow to the ground in reverence and prostrate your reason to divine revelation and kneel with those who kneel to do homage and honour to Almighty Allah
This narrative which we relate to you, O Muhammad, represents some of the true events you did not know nor did you comprehend by sight. You were not present at their meeting when they cast lots using their quills and arrows to see which of them would be the foster father to Maryam. Nor were you present when they quarrelled about the point in question
The angels said to Maryam: "O Maryam here we relate to you a divine edict. Allah intimates to you the announcement of a happy event, the arrival of a male child, the product of a word from Him, designated the Messiah ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, who shall be distinguished here and Hereafter and of those nearest to Allah
He shall speak to people in his cradle and in manhood, and he shall be one of those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
Maryam asked : "How shall I have a son, O Allah, my Creator, when no man has touched me? She was told: "Thus does Allah create what He will; when He decrees a thing He only says ‘Be’ and it is
He shall teach him the Book of Knowledge and Wisdom and He shall teach him AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil
He shall be a Messenger to Bani Isra‘il, conveying acts of miraculous nature serving to demonstrate his delegated divine power and authority to influence their conduct and their actions. He shall be instructed to say to them "I have brought you an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace. I shall create for you from clay the figure of a bird and bring it to life and there it shall be a living bird by Allah’s command. I shall restore the sight of the man who is congenitally blind and heal the leper, and with delegated divine authority I shall raise the dead by Allah’s command. I shall also inform you of what you eat and of what you store in reserve in your homes. This should be enough divine evidence to bring you to acknowledge the truth of my mission if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
And to bring matters to completion-, "It shall be my duty to Allah to corroborate your faith in AL-Tawrah which is set before me and to make lawful to you some of what was forbidden before". "Now, I have come to you with convincing divine evidence which exacts your reverence for Allah and obedience to me
Allah is certainly my Creator; and your Creator. He exacts your obedience and your reverence and veneration by appropriate acts and rites; this is the course of action which constitutes the path of righteousness
But when ‘Isa could sense that disbelief was a very prevalent inclination among them, he asked: "Who will support me in the cause of Allah?" We are supporters of the cause of Allah, said the disciples, "We have believed in Allah to the point that our hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. We hold you as a witness to our conformity to Islam, the will of Allah
And to strengthen their purpose, they prayed: "O Allah, our Creator, we recognize all that You have revealed and we have fallen in line with the Messenger. O Allah, our Creator incorporate us with those who bear witness to the truth and to the glory of Your system of faith and worship
And the unbelievers among Ahl al-Kitab with cleverness had recourse to stratagem yet in His plan, Allah also had recourse to stratagem, and who can gain advantage on Allah
There and then said Allah to ‘Isa, "O ‘Isa, I am ordaining that you depart from this life. I am taking you up to My August presence and ridding you of the troublesome blasphemers among your contemporaries and out of harm's way. I am raising those who recognized your mission and accepted your apostleship to higher ranks and exalting them in dignity and power above those who denied you till the Day of Resurrection when to Me shall all of you return. Then I will judge between you on the strained points of dispute upon which the whole unreasoning turned
There and then I shall put to the torment those who did not believe in the truths of religion as contained in Allah’s authentic and authoritative Books; who did not justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will, nor did they have spiritual apprehension of divine truths; they shall suffer a condign punishment here and Hereafter, and no one shall afford them help
But those who justified faith as a conviction operative on their character and will and whose hearts had been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and whose deeds impressed with wisdom and piety, shall Allah reward them with what is generously commensurate with their pious deeds. Allah detests those who are wrongful of actions
Such discourse as We have narrated to you, O Muhammad, is a disclosure of facts and revelations streaming from the Fountainhead the Quran, the sublime source of all manner of wisdom
The example of ‘Isa, as determined by Allah, stood in exact similitude with that of Adam whom He created of dust then ordained that he "Be" and so he was
This is the absolute truth, declared in words by Allah, your Creator, therefore, do not let their intentional assertion of what is false make you doubtful and anxious
Should any one contend with you about ‘Isa with opposing arguments, the fact shall destroy the fiction. Now that you know the facts, say to them "Come, let us summon our sons and your sons, our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves and pray Allah and beseech Him to accurse those who intentionally assert falsehood
This narrative is indeed the true story, and emphatically, there is no Ilah but Allah and indeed Allah is He who has always been and forever shall be AL- Aziz and AL-Hakim
Should they still turn a deaf ear, rest assured, O Muhammad, that Allah is fully aware of those who are characterized with malice
Say to them: “O you Ahl al-Kitab, let us come to terms to agree among ourselves that we venerate and worship no one but Allah and that we shall not incorporate with Him other deities. Nor shall any of us take another for a godhead or a tutelary guardian besides Allah." If they turn a deaf ear and insist upon hugging their irreverent conviction to their hearts, then say to them: "Do then bear witness that we conform our will to Allah’s blessed will, and this reflects conformity to Islam
Say to them: "O you Ahl al-Kitab, why continue with arguments to your life’s end about Ibrahim (Abraham) and whether he was a Jew or a Christian? You know that both AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil were not revealed till a point of time far distant and long after his time. Can you not see that
There, you continued with arguments about your system of faith and of the mission of ‘Isa, son of Maryam. Why bring forward reasons in support of or against a matter of which you have empty knowledge? Allah is 'Alimun whereas you are not
Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian but an Orthodox Muslim. He never incorporated with Allah other deities
Indeed those who best deserve a rightful claim to spiritual affinity to Ibrahim are those who followed his system of faith and worship, inclusive of this Prophet –Muhammad– and those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand. Allah is the Tutelary Guardian of those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Some among Ahl al-Kitab wish they could lead you people astray, when in point of fact they alienate themselves from Allah’s purpose and path of righteousness but they fail to perceive that their imagination is often at war with reason and fact
O you Ahl al-Kitab, why do you always deny Allah’s revelations and visible signs when you yourselves bear witness to their truth and verity
O you Ahl al-Kitab, why do you always confuse the truth with falsehood and mix it up in the minds of the people and intentionally conceal the truth when you admit it into your minds
In their malice, did some among Ahl al-Kitab incite their fellow religionists to pretend at the beginning of the day that they give credence to what has been revealed to you Muslims. Then at the end of the day they repudiated it as if it were a second thought, expecting that those who are unsettled in allegiance or belief among you may hopefully reject it all
They caution their people against you and express their thoughts in words. "Do not trust any one," they say, "except those who follow the same law." Say to them, O Muhammad: "Indeed the only law consented to by Allah is the law based on the course steered by Allah; the only course leading to the path of righteousness where Providence is the guide." They caution their people against discoursing you Muslims on divine matters lest you use this knowledge to claim a Book and a Prophet of your own or that you may use the part of it which is against their interest and confound them before Allah, your Creator when all assemble in His Venerable and revered Majestic presence. Say to them, O Muhammad "grace rests in the hands of Allah. He confers it on whom He will and Allah is Wasi’un(Omnipresent) and 'Alimun
He extends His mercy to whom He will and He is the source of sufficient grace which abounds in whom He will and of the efficacious grace which effects the end for which it is given
Among Ahl al-Kitab there is he whom you can entrust with a cental of gold and he would return it to you on demand. Also among them is he who if entrusted with one single dinar, would not return it unless you keep asking and he may eventually be pronounced a defaulter. This is by reason of their folly and want of sense that they interpret in words. "We are not," they say, "under any obligation to these illiterate faithless people -the Muslims-" and they intentionally relate to Allah falsehood which they admit into their minds
Indeed he who fulfils his promise when he pledges himself before Allah to do what is to be done, keeps the vow when he binds himself by one, his words and deeds together accord and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah shall come in the grace of Allah for Allah likes those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Those who exchange Allah’s covenant or a vow to heaven or an oath that is binding for a miserable price featured in the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world shall be denied Allah’s grace Hereafter. Nor shall Allah address them, or look at them on the Day of Resurrection. He shall not bless them, and there awaits them a severe punishment
Among Ahl al-Kitab are some who seem to recite divine revelations documented in the Quran in jest to distort the words from common use. They expect to imprint on your minds that these are verses of the Quran, while in fact they are not. They relate them to Allah when in fact they are not Allah’s words and they relate to Allah falsehood and they admit it into their minds
It is hardly intelligible that a human on whom Allah confers the Book and the wisdom and the prerogative of Prophethood would demand of the people to worship him in lieu of Allah. Rather he would ask of them by virtue of right and authority to pay reverence and veneration to Allah, the Creator, and to adore Him with appropriate acts and rites and devotion. This is the logical sequence which Allah has imparted to them, the divine knowledge which they have imparted to people, the divine knowledge which they themselves have applied their minds to its acquisition
Allah does not ordain that you take the angels and the Prophets as tutelary deities. Would he command you to deny Him after you have conformed your will to His blessed will and accepted His divine system of faith and worship
Allah entered into a covenant with the Prophets, expressing the obligation to which they are bound. "I have given you the Book," He said, "and acquainted your hearts with wisdom. So when there comes a Messenger with a Book that corroborates and authoritatively validates the Authentic Books you hold in possession, you shall faithfully recognize him, uphold him and help him accomplish his mission. Now do you all subscribe to this allegiance and shall you pledge yourselves before Me to keep the vow!" They said: "We pray the prayer and vow the vow." "Then," Allah said, "you bear witness to this obligation which you shall relate to your people, and here do I subscribe to be also a witness to this course of action
Therefore, those who counsel deaf to this obligation are the perverse who are faithless and morally depraved
Is it a system of faith and worship other than that ordained by Allah that they desire, when to His blessed will have all creation in the heavens and on earth submitted willingly or unwillingly and in the end back to Him shall all return
O Muhammad, declare in explicit terms: We Muslims believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. We believe in all that has been imparted to us in the Quran and in all that was imparted to Ibrahim and Isma’il, to Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya’qub (Jacob) and to the tribes of his twelve sons and in what was imparted to Mussa and to ‘Isa. We believe in all that was imparted to all the Prophets from Allah, their Creator. We do not discriminate one from another and we conform our will to His blessed will. He is the heart of our purpose
He who adopts a system of faith and worship other than Islam simply bends on a system of faith and worships which does not have the standing upon the vantage ground of truth. Such a system of faith shall not be accepted from him and he shall be a great loser Hereafter
How shall Allah consent to guide a people who intentionally deny Him after they have recognized Him and bore witness to the truth of His Messenger's mission? How shall He guide them after they had received and accepted then later on rejected the clear and plain revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstition! Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness those who are wrongful of actions
Such persons shall be requited with what is commensurate with their deeds; they have incurred the curse of Allah and of the angels and of all mankind
This curse shall beset them to Eternity. Nor shall their torture in Hell be abated nor shall their punishment be put in respite
However the penitents who in lowliest plight repentant stood and reformed themselves so their thoughts are governed by a new and divine principle, shall find that Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
Indeed those who deny Allah after they have recognized Him and be so bold as to display their infidelity by acts of sedition and hostility in defiance of piety, never shall their penitence be accepted, and these are they who have been lost in the maze of error
Those who deny Allah and death claims them clothed with the ugly vestments of disbelief, they shall have committed an unforgivable sin. The offer of as much gold as the earth can treasure shall not be accepted from any of them in expiation for his guilt. Such persons must expect endless suffering and shall find no one to afford them help
You people shall not attain piety, the groundwork of Allah’s system of faith and worship, until you spend of what you treasure and cherish in divine service. Whatever you spend in this respect comes to Allah’s knowledge
All articles of food were lawful to Bani Isra‘il except what Ya’qub forbade to himself. His children followed suit before Mussa was sent and AL-Tawrah revealed. Say to them, O Muhammad: "Bring AL-Tawrah and read its text if what you are negating is true
Henceforth, he who relates to Allah falsehood and intentionally asserts what is false shall be seen as those who are wrongful in actions
Say to them: "Allah has declared the truth, therefore, follow you people, the religion of Ibrahim, the true and straight forward devotee and follow his system of faith and worship. He never incorporated with Allah other deities
The first house devoted specifically for divine worship and appropriated to assemblies for the adoration of Allah with appropriate acts and rites was the house founded in Bakkah (Macca). It has been blessed with the spirit of truth guiding all beings into all truth
It is majestically dignified with outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace including Ibrahim’s station where he performed the prescribed acts of devotion. Whoever comes into it shall have the privilege of a sanctuary; he comes to be vested with immunity from harm and liability. The pilgrimage to there is a duty incumbent on people; those of them who can afford to do homage and honour to Almighty Allah. He who refuses to acknowledge this religious rite must realize that Allah is Ghaniyun (independent) of all creation, Self Existent and Absolute
Say to Ahl al-Kitab: "Why do you deny Allah’s revelations and visible signs when Allah is Shahidun ( Omniscient) of all that you do
And ask them: "Why do you stand in the way, preventing Allah’s spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth? Why do you make it your aim to pervert the truth and crook the path of righteousness to your own ends when you bear witness to the fact that this is the path where Providence is the Guide? Allah is not unmindful of all that you do
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand, if you open your hearts' ears to some of Ahl AL-Kitab, they will alienate you from Allah’s purpose. They shall turn you renegades and you shall go over from your religion after you have conformed to Islam
How can you consent to the denial of Allah when Allah’s revelations are narrated to you and the truth of the matter is stated to you and Allah’s Messenger is in your midst! He who turns his mind to Allah and chooses to be under His tutelage shall have been guided to the path of righteousness
You who believed and gave credence to the Prophet's mission, revere Allah in the manner appropriate to His Absolute Sovereignty. Entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and adhere to Allah’s' system of faith and worship so that when death lays his hands on you and you go through its door, you will have conformed your will to Allah’s blessed will
Hold firmly together and grasp the eternal and unchangeable sublime system of Allah! Lay hold of it with the mind and do not be discordant among yourselves. Call to mind Allah’s favour that you wear. You were enemies and He accorded your differences and you cherished different principles and practices and by His grace you are now in one accord. You were on the edge of the bottomless abyss of Hell and He saved you from eternal disaster. Thus, Allah expounds to you His revelations so that you may hopefully be guided to His path of righteousness
Let there be unity in feeling and purpose among you. Be united as one whole who would enjoin conformity of life and conduct to the requirements of divine and moral law. Forbid all that is wrongful and obscene. Such people shall reap the fruits of victory here and in the Hereafter
Do not be like those who were divided among themselves and discordant after they have received divine revelations and signs guiding them out of darkness and superstition and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment. Such people shall suffer grievously
This shall be on the day when countenances speak different languages; some being effulgent with splendour and bright light, beaming with joy and hope while others are dark and gloomy. Rebuked for want of faith, they shall be told: "How could you deny Allah after you have recognized Him. You have well deserved to be put to the torment in requital of infidelity
Whereas those whose countenances are expressive of joy and hope shall be the recipients of Allah’s blessings; they shall be beset with Allah’s infinite mercy
These are Allah’s revelations O Muhammad, We narrate them to you in truth, and it has never been Allah’s purpose to exercise injustice to people
To Allah belong all that is in the Heavens and all that is on Earth, and to Allah, the Ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and in the Hereafter
You Muslims have been the best people* that have evolved from mankind for mankind. You enjoin equity and you recourse to general principles of justice. You forbid all that is wrongful and obscene and you conform your will to Allah’s blessed will
They will not hurt your interests O Mohammad nor will they harm you. They will only be a source of annoyance. If they war against you they will turn tail and seek safety in flight and will not be crowned with victory
They have been stamped with humiliation (The Jews) wherever they are found, except when they come to be under the tutelage of Allah and at peace with people. They came within the measure of Allah’s wrath and they were stamped with mortification of pride. Their unjustifiable slaying of the Prophets was in the train of their defiance of piety. Their disobedience was natural to them that it became an addiction to transgression
But in fairness to them, Ahl AL-Kitab are not all alike. Among them are a people who conform their will to Allah’s blessed will; a people who recite verses of Allah’s revelations by night and bow to the ground in reverence and adoration and prostrate their reason to divine revelation
They believe in Allah with hearts impressed with images of religious and spiritual virtues and they are mindful of the Hereafter. They enjoin equity and recourse to general principles of justice and they condemn the bad and emulate the best. Such people are enrolled among the righteous
Whatever good they do, they shall never be denied the fruit nor the reward of any deed imprinted with wisdom and piety. Allah is fully aware of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Indeed those who denied Allah were born to be losers; neither their wealth nor their progeny shall profit them or afford them help nor be beneficially effective against what Allah has for them in store. These are the inmates of hell to endure for that vast forever
The example of whatever they spent in this world that was not pertaining to Allah is just like the crops of wrong headed farmers who were wrongful of actions. Their yield was hit by an icy cold wind that reduced it to ruin. It was not Allah Who did them injustice but it was they who wronged themselves
O you people whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues: do not have as intimate associates a body of persons of another law; they shall not hesitate to pervert you. They eagerly wish to overthrow you or bring an irretrievable disaster upon you. Nature has written a letter of discredit upon their faces that reflect hatred; such a hatred that is portrayed in their thoughts which they express in words, but worse is what their bosoms conceal. We have made to you Our revelations clear and plain if only you have soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends
You see how you hold them dear and entertain great regard for them while they do not reciprocate the same feeling. You give credence to all the Books which Allah has revealed while they do not. When they come face to face with you they declare that they have conformed their will to Allah’s blessed will but when they are apart from you, they bite their lips and their finger tips in the rage of distemper. Say to them O Muhammad: "Perish those whose minds are backwards and perish you in the rage of your distemper; Allah is indeed 'Alimun of all private thoughts and feelings in the breast
If good fortune falls to you, be it through victory or through martyrdom, they come to be actuated by envy and grieved at heart. If you are befallen with a disaster or wedded to a calamity, they rejoice beyond a common joy. If you be patient and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you shall not be hurt by their wicked plots and intrigues. Allah besets them on all sides and He is 'Alimun of all that they do
Remember O Muhammad that once when you left your household early in the morning resolving to take your station for battle and to command your faithful followers to take post and Allah is Sami’un, and 'Alimun
Then two of your tribes almost lost heart. However, they were saved by the graceful tutelage of Allah, and in Allah should those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust
The Battle of Badr ought to have taught you abhorrence of want of faith and lack of discipline. Allah has made victory sit on your helm even though you were an insignificant humble force out of heart. Therefore, revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him so that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude
You Muhammad told your faithful troops, who were confronted with an unexpected situation and thought they were affronting death, to lift up their hearts and their morale. You said to them: "Is it not enough for you that Allah, your Creator, upholds you with an array of three thousand angels specially dispatched from heaven's realm to support your cause
Indeed if you exercise patience and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah you shall be able to do battle against your enemy. Should you be taken by surprise and be suddenly attacked you shall receive Allah’s aid; He shall uphold you with an array of five thousand angels emblematic of onslaught
Such an announcement of Allah’s aid was meant to be cheerful news to raise your spirits and to ease your anguish of a torturing hour and make you rest assured of victory. It should have made you realize that victory and the position of supremacy and superiority are an attribute and an act of Allah, AL- Aziz and AL-Hakim
Allah ordained this course of events. He purposed to strike a part of the evil group of infidels at the root and so with one single blow would they be severed, or to disgrace them and enrage their blood and put them into such a commotion that would precipitate their humiliation and defeat
It is none of your concern nor is it the concern of your people O Muhammad whether Allah reduces your enemy's number and their land or the extent of their power and wealth or whether He effects their defeat or relents and pardons their offence or requites them with retributive punishment. They are a wrongful people
To Allah belong all that is in the Heavens and all that is on Earth. He forgives whom He will and punishes whom He will. Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
O you who have conformed to Islam! Usury is incompatible with religion. Do not swallow voraciously whatever interest you can get for the money you lend, doubling and redoubling the interest as you go. Revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him so that heaven may prosper you
And save yourselves the Fire especially prepared for those who disobey Allah’s commands
Obey Allah and His Messenger so that you may come to be recipients of His mercy
Enter into rivalry with each other for forgiveness from Allah, your Creator, and for a hearty welcome in a Paradise as extensive as are the Heavens and the Earth, specially prepared for those who revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
It is a paradise of supreme bliss prepared specially for those who spend in divine service in instances of prosperity and in instances of adversity, who restrain and suppress their feeling of anger and accord people forgiveness and do not entertain them with thoughts of ill will. Allah likes those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence
Those who no sooner do they commit an immoral act, than they at once recall Allah to mind and invoke His forgiveness. Who can forgive transgression of the divine law and the offence against Allah but Him? They do not insist on their course of action when they know it is wrong
Such persons shall merit forgiveness from Allah, their Creator, and the life in supreme bliss in gardens beneath which rivers flow after they will have passed through nature to Eternity. How excellent is the reward of those who strive for a good end
A narration of events, modes of action and examples from ages past serve as evidence for each instance forming a particular case of principle and a signal instance of punishment. Therefore, journey the land you Muslims and pause to think and meditate what you see with your minds’ eyes in order to realize the fatal consequence which united all those who persisted in their intentional assertion of falsehood
This is a proclamation for mankind that is documented in the Quran in which Providence is the guide, and an admonition to those who revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful To Him
Do not falter in your war of belief against positive unbelief nor grieve at heart, for you shall gain the upper hand if your hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
If you have sustained a heavy blow with injuries, so have the enemies. We rotate fortune and alternate the days of gratification and the days of distress. So that each people have their day and Allah distinguishes the steadfast among the believers who are immovable in faith and confers the prerogative of martyrdom on those of you who qualify; Allah detests the wrongful
And Allah fits those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues so purified to rid them of doubt and of those who are hypocrites and to massacre the infidels who deny Him
Did you think that you would be heartily welcomed in the realm of surpassing beauty and supreme bliss before Allah has seen that you have distinguished yourselves on every front or line of battle and that you have been distinguished into the valiant and those who are unwearied in the face of difficulties
Before the encounter with death, you had always wished yourselves dead in the cause of Allah, and now that you have seen it executed in your companions, you falter and let go; you quit your posts and seek much after booty
Muhammad is but a Messenger the like of whom have passed away before him. Do you mean if he dies or is slain in battle, you turn renegades and return to idolatry! Indeed he who turns back on his heels and reverses his position shall never hurt Allah’s interest in the least, and Allah shall reward the thankful
Nor can a soul be disembodied except by Allah’s permission according to a predetermined point of time that had been entered in a Book. He who so sets his mind upon the mundane things ministering to his enjoyment and content here below shall be requited with what is apportioned to him in this world. He who so sets his mind upon the divine things conducing to Allah’s mercy and grace Hereafter shall be requited with what is commensurate with his deeds of wisdom and piety. We will generously reward those who impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude
A good many of the Prophets fought against positive disbelief and with them fought countless numbers of devotees whose hearts had been touched with the divine hand. Never did they falter in consequence of the misfortunes they experienced in the cause of Allah, nor were they disheartened or dispirited, nor did they acknowledge themselves beaten. Allah likes the patient who are unwearied in the face of difficulties
All they said was no other than their prayer of invocation: "O Allah, our Creator, forgive us our iniquities and the excesses into which we might have been driven and help us take a firm position and set our feet firm, and make victory and fortune sit on our helm so that we reduce those who deny you to ruin
In return did Allah requite them with what they merited for their deeds of wisdom and piety here below and the surpassing merit Hereafter. Allah likes those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence
O you who have conformed to Islam do not falter by consequence of misfortunes in battle nor lend an ear to the infidels who deny Allah. For if you open your hearts, ears to them, they shall be able to turn you renegades and you will relapse into infidelity and come to be great losers
Do not forget that Allah is your Tutelary Guardian and who can gain advantage on Allah
We will inspire terror in the infidels' hearts and dishearten them for incorporating with Allah other deities He never authorized. Their destined abode is Hell and evil indeed is the destined habitation of the wrongful
Allah has kept His promise to you as was shown in putting your enemy to rout, Allah permitting, until you began to falter by reason of opposing arguments. Some were in favour of obeying the Prophet's command and maintaining their posts and the others against his command, running after booty, at a time when the Prophet was about to make the victory. Among you are those who are concerned only with the interests and pleasures of life below and its mundane things, and others whose main concern is Allah’s grace Hereafter. Then did Allah distract your minds and your attention and made you draw off from the battle field to test your true inclination and He afforded you forgiveness. Allah’s bounty abounds in those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
You forced your way up the hill paying attention to no one while the Prophet in the rear convoked you to come to fight. There, did Allah requite you with grief, upon grief, for being balked of your booty and for fleeing in the face of danger, so that you would learn not to grieve for what you miss nor to despair for what befalls you. Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do
Thereafter did Allah replace the emotion of sorrow and grief by peace of mind and sense of security, which induced the eyes of some of you to take themselves to slumber. Others were aroused to emotion, which begot unjust suspicion of Allah, and a state of mind characteristic of ignorance - analogous to the ignorance induced by paganism. The latter keep their thoughts to themselves and do not express them to you O Muhammad and they say to themselves: "If we had a say in the matter we would never have been slain here in battle!" Say to them: "Had you decided to be the stay- at- home, those of you predestined to be slain would have emerged to the sites of their interment." Such a train of events, Allah has ordained to expose your actions interpreting your thoughts, and to test your innermost being for such a disposition as your hearts and minds would incline you to propound. Allah is 'Alimun of all that is stored in the bosoms
Those of you who turned tail and abandoned their posts on the day the two forces met were but victims of AL-Shaytan. Who took advantage of their disobedience to the Prophet and led them to their fall from their first perfection. However Allah has afforded them forgiveness. He is Ghafurun (Indulgent), and Halimun (Forbearing)
O you who conformed to Islam, be not like those infidels who denied Allah and thought they could prevent what is fated to happen. On every occasion when they lost some of their fellow countrymen in journeys of trade or in wars, they expressed their thoughts in words: "Had they been with us and remained here, they would not have died nor been slain." This feeling and thought did Allah infuse into them to actuate their hearts and minds with grief. It is Allah who gives life and occasions the moment of death and He is 'Alimun of all that you do
If you are slain in the course of a hostile encounter between belief and positive unbelief or you die in battle or from another cause, you will have merited Allah’s forgiveness and mercy. This outweighs all that you might have earned or accumulated had you been carried through the stealing steps of age into advanced life. Therefore, give up resentment against them and invoke on their behalf Allah’s mercy
Whether you die or be slain, shall all of you be gathered to Allah
Allah of His mercy made your heart, O Muhammad, ever tender in the treatment of the calamity which they -your people- brought upon themselves in battle. He made you speak to them in the gentle voice of peace. Had you been unsparing in censure and reproof and harsh hearted, they would have broken the bonds of loyalty and would have broken away from you. Therefore, give up resentment against them and invoke on their behalf Allah’s mercy and consult with them upon matters of great moment, matters on which you received no divine authoritative instructions. So when you have caused a discord to pass into a concord and resolved on a course of action, then in Allah you trust, for Allah likes those who put their trust in Him
If Allah upholds you and confers on you His tutelary protection, no one can gain advantage over you, and if He should deny you tutelary protection, who else is there besides Him who can protect you or help you in distress and misfortune! In Allah should those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust
It is not a Prophet who would appropriate spoils or anything else to wrong uses or apply it dishonestly to his own use. Nor would he ever betray the trust or the one who trusted him. He who withholds from anyone what is his, by right, shall carry in Day of Judgement the insignia of fraud and misappropriation when every soul shall be requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and no one shall be wronged
Shall he who obeyed Allah’s statutes in quest of Allah’s satisfaction compare with the one who came within the measure of Allah’s wrath and has been destined to the abode in Hell, which is an evil destiny
People are divided according to grades of quality, disposition and attributes as determined by Allah. Allah is Bassirun, He sees all that they do
Allah has been gracious to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand. He raised in their midst a Messenger who is related to them by kinship and by spiritual qualities into which they all entered. He is a Messenger who shall recite to them His revelations, impart sanctity to them and teach them the Book -the Quran- and acquaint their hearts with wisdom, notwithstanding that they were once lost in the maze of error and liberally swam in immoral pleasure
Now that you have been wedded to a calamity which you brought upon yourselves by consequence of disobedience when the two forces met, a calamity which does not compare with that you brought on your enemy that was twice as severe; now you ask: "How did it happen and what was it due to?" Say to them O Muhammad "You brought it on yourselves as a logical conclusion for your wrongful action. Allah is indeed Qadirun over all things
What befell you that day when the two forces met was justly brought about by Allah’s permission to distinguish those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues
He exposes the hypocrites who pretended to be other then they are. When they were asked to join the Muslim forces to fight in the cause of Allah or at least to defend their own interests; they made excuses. They said, "We would gladly follow you if we knew how to fight." They were then furthermost from Allah and their words did not accord to their inmost thoughts. Allah knows best their secret feelings
It was those who stayed at home who had something to say in defense and extenuation of their conduct. They made unfavourable comments on their fellow Muslims who were slain in battle; They said; "Had they obeyed us and remained here, they would not have been slain." Say to them O Muhammad. "If this be the case, then avert death and prevent it from befalling you if indeed you are declaring the truth
Do not consider them dead the martyrs in the cause of Allah for they are living in heaven's realm in the venerable and. revered August presence of Allah, their Creator, laying in divine provisions
Rejoicing beyond a common joy at Allah’s bounty abounding in them and joyful for those who are yet to join them for they shall have no grounds for alarm nor shall fear or dread fall upon them nor shall they come to grief
They have assumed a state of mind that brightens up their faces for the grace and the bounty conferred on them by Allah. It is a state of mind with an air of assurance that Allah does not withhold nor withdraw the grateful return due to those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Who responded favourably to Allah and to His Prophet and resumed fighting after they had stopped having been wedded to the calamity. It was those who excelled at the battle and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; they shall be requited with what is generously commensurate with their deeds
The news simply strengthened them mentally and morally and confirmed their faith, when they were told by the people that their enemies had mustered up a great number of troops to fight against them so, they should be fearful of them. It was those who did not fear fate; they feared naught but Allah, and said; "Allah is the answer to our purpose, our hopes and our needs, and how excellent He is for the Tutelary Guardian
Never was battle executed with greater determination, that the enemy had sensed and consequently fled from the rage of those whom they considered persecutors. There and then did the Muslims return, by the grace of Allah and His bounty, unharmed and not even touched physically in any way. They espoused the cause of Allah and His satisfaction and were consequently qualified to receive His blessings, and Allah’s bounty is plentiful, full flowing
It was only AL-Shaytan hiding behind those with characteristics befitting him, who inspired terror in the hearts and minds of those who were submissive to them, who in turn tried to transmit it to some of you! Therefore, do not be fearful of them but fear Me if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Let not those who impel themselves heedlessly on infidelity grieve you O Muhammad. They shall not harm Allah in the least. Allah has intended to allot to them no share of the bliss Hereafter, and there awaits them a condign punishment
Those who exchanged faith for infidelity shall never harm Allah in the least and their awaits them the torment which shall be laid on the damned
The infidels must not think that the respite We grant them is for their own good; We simply give them plenty of rope to allow them free action in order that they commit themselves further to the evil line of conduct. There awaits them a condign and humiliating punishment
It was never in the set of Allah’s correlated principles to let those who conformed to Islam remain in this present state which is a combination of circumstances and attributes, but only to segregate the bad from the good, expose the malevolent and distinguish the benevolent. Nor did Allah intend to endow you people with the prerogative of divination nor with power of knowing the unknown or realizing the unseen or the invisible. Yet He chooses from His Prophets whom He will and gives them knowledge of events to come according to His will. Therefore, believe you people in Allah and give credence to His Prophets, for if you believe with hearts that reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, you shall be requited with a great reward
Nor should those who are unwilling to spend in divine service of what Allah conferred on them consider this tight fisted disposition an advantage to them. To the contrary, it is an injury to their interest and prejudice to their credit. They shall be fitted round their necks in Day of Judgement with the insignia of what they hoarded. To Allah shall be the inheritance of the realms of the Heavens and the Earth, and Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do
Allah has heard the discourse of those of Ahl AL-Kitab who expressed their thoughts in words, saying: "Allah is poor whereas we are rich." We will record their dissertation as well as their unjustified slaying of the prophets, and shall say to them at the predetermined moment: "Now taste the torment of burning in the Fire
This is the train of evil that your wrongful and unclean hands have drawn after them." Allah is not unjust to His servants
Who said: "Allah has enjoined us not to give credence to a Prophet until he has presented to us an offering which of necessity be devoured by a fire from heaven." Say to them O Muhammad: "Many Prophets before me had presented you with clear evidence of Allah’s Omnipotence and of their delegated divine authority and with such divinely miraculous acts as you have described, why then did you bring death upon them if indeed you are declaring the truth
Should they disbelieve you and think you convey a false message; they had already refused credence to Messengers sent before you; who were sent to them with clear and plain revelations and signs, Scriptures and Psalms guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment
Every soul is destined to the encounter with death and in Day of Judgement shall you be requited only with what is due to you. He who is diverted from the path leading to Hell to the path bounding for Paradise will have triumphed. Life here below is but an animate existence affording pleasure, deceiving those with foolishly credulous ambition and vain employment of time
You people shall be afflicted with some disagreeable events and misfortunes to test your qualities. You shall experience loss in wealth and in lives and you shall hear injuriously contemptuous insults from those who received the Book before you as well as from those who incorporate with Allah other deities. If you are patient and forbearing and you entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you will have then considered matters with an attitude of mind reflecting high spirit and strong will
For once did Allah make a covenant with Ahl AL-Kitab. They should make the Book genuinely known to everyone and not hide the least part of its text and its precepts. However they cast it behind their backs and exchanged the truth for the worthless vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. How evil and how ill indeed is the advantage they gained
Do not think, O Muhammad; that those who rejoice at their successful perversion of their own Scriptures from its original purity to what accords with their own desire, and love to be credited with theological virtues which they do not possess, that they shall escape torment!. They shall in fact be put to the torture
To Allah belongs the Absolute Sovereignty of the realms of the Heavens and the Earth. Allah is Qadirun over all things
Indeed, the creation of the Heavens and the Earth, and the variation in duration and the constant alternation and succession symbolic of the night and the day are signs with prodigies emblematic of Omnipotence and Authority sensed by those who reflect
They think of Allah with reverent feeling, standing, sitting and lying on their sides and ponder and meditate the infinite creation of the Heavens and the Earth. They interpret their thoughts in words of an invocatory prayer: "O Allah, our Creator, the One and only Ilah they say, You did not bring all this into being and caused it to exist to no effect or purpose. Glory be to You and extolled are Your glorious attributes. We beseech You to ensure us immunity from the torment of the Fire
O Allah, our Creator, indeed, he whom You destine to the abode in the Fire of Hell, You will have vested with the insignia of shame, and no help shall be afforded the wrongful
We heard O Allah, our Creator, a herald promulgating spiritual prompting to recognize Allah, the Creator, and to serve Him, and we responded favourably by adopting Your system of faith and worship. O Allah, our Creator, we pray and beseech You to afford us forgiveness of our iniquities and to remit Our deeds of an evil savour and to allow our disembodied souls to join those of the righteous
We pray and beseech you O Allah to bestow on us what You promised us at the hands of Your Prophets and not put us to shame on the Day of Resurrection; You certainly never fail to fulfill a promise
There did Allah respond favourably to their invocation and answer their prayer; He said "Indeed I do not annul, withhold nor withdraw the fruit anyone, man or a woman, is entitled to reap from deeds of wisdom and piety, you spring one from the other. Therefore, those who emigrated and were ousted from their homes and suffered in My cause and fought the war of belief against positive unbelief and have survived or been slain shall be entitled to a great reward. I will remit their deeds of an evil savour, I will welcome them in gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, a reward from Heaven, and in Allah’s grace rest hope and mercy and the best reward
Let not the instances of prosperity falling to the infidels by the labour of trading from one place to another deceive you O Muhammad
Wicked men are not denied prosperity, but the pleasure it affords them is of short duration, and then punishment must follow conviction. They are destined to the abode in Hell and evil indeed is that abode
Those who revered Allah and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him shall be heartily welcomed in gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity in a perpetual ecstatic delight, characterizing the abode prepared for them by Allah. Whatever Allah has in His heaven's realm of blissful rapture is the best reward which merits expectant waiting by those vested with conformity of life and conduct to the requirements of the divine and moral laws
Certainly, among Ahl AL-Kitab are those who believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues; they give credence to all that has been revealed to you Muslims and to all that had been revealed to them. They humble themselves to Allah and never do they exchange the truth and the established divine principles for the worthless vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. Allah shall reward such people with what is generously commensurate with their deeds of wisdom and piety. Allah is swift indeed in putting the law into execution
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand, in patience you possess your souls. Outdo all others in exercising patience in the face of difficulties and sit, like patience on a monument, smiling at grief and maintain your deeds of wisdom and piety and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah so that Heaven may prosper you
O you people: revere Allah your Creator, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, Who brought you -into being from one single soul-Adam- and from him did He create his mate -Eve-, and from joining both in matrimony did He propagate multitudes of men and women. And revere Allah Whom you invoke for aid and protection and to Whom you appeal in witness that a statement or the like is true, and revere the wombs. That bore you and regard them as having a divine and sacred character; Allah has always been Raqibun (Omnipresent), He has always kept a vigilant eye upon you
And restore to the orphans their property and do not exchange the worthless which you might own for the good and valuable which they own, nor incorporate their property with your property; this has always been regarded by Allah as a great sin
Should you have an uneasy sense of the probability of an unjust action against the orphans' interest consequent on volition stronger than your own viz. marriage for selfish motive principles, age incompatibility, inappropriate dower, marriage against their wish then make for them other arrangements
And give the women, whom you join in wedlock. their dower with good will. But if they -the women- willingly remit a part thereof of their own accord, then you may eat it into your hearts and enjoy it; may it give you pleasure; may it do you good
And when time is ripe to hand over the property, with which you are entrusted, to the orphans who now come of age, make sure they are not characterized by a disordered mind; this property is in fact the trust of the community but held in trust by a particular individual. If they are incapable, then exempt them from this responsibility but gently and with kindness. And the property shall serve as the source from which you sustain them and clothe them. And let your dissertation with them be a sweet discourse
And test the orphans now and then until they reach maturity and be fit -for marriage. If you feel they are characterized by good sense and prudence, then hand over to them their property and you must not abuse it nor act with expedition of time and events to absorb it or devour it before they come of age. And he who is entrusted with the property must not impose a liability or charge a fee for the execution of his functions, but be virtuous should he be wealthy and opulent. But if he is poor, then he may remunerate himself with equity. And when you hand over the, property to them -the orphans- you must have others witness the transfer, and sufficient is Allah to be Hasibun (a Witness Who calls to account)
Men have a rightful claim to the property left by the parents and the kindred, and, women have the same rightful claim to the property left by the parents and the kindred, be it little or much; it is a clearly defined portion allotted to them by Providence
And should the poor relatives, the orphans and the needy be present at the occasion of dividing the heritage and distributing it among the heirs, then provide. them with some portion of it as a gesture to avoid a disappointment of their expectation and the envy they feel at the superior advantages of others. And let your dissertation with them be a sweet discourse
And let those who are settling the property upon the heirs revere Allah and keep him in mind and be disposed to propose what is right as they would like others to do with their heirs on whose account they shall be deeply concerned should they be left young and helpless
Indeed those who wrongfully eat the orphans out of their property simply consume but fire into their bellies and shall suffer conflagration
Allah commends - to you your children thus
And you have a rightful claim to half what your wives have left if they have no child
These are the limiting provisions imposed by Allah, and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger shall be a recipient of Allah's blessings; Allah shall welcome them into gardens of bliss beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, and this is indeed a triumph supreme
And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and goes beyond the limiting provisions prescribed by Allah, shall Heaven lay his transgression to his charge; Allah admits him to Hell wherein he shall last forever, suffering a humiliating punishment
And those of your women who commit themselves to acts of sexual immorality shall be punished on the credit of four witnesses of your men (co-religionists) who are known to recourse to general principles of justice. Should these men attest to the truth of the act, then confine them indoors (or in-doors) until death claims them or until Allah ordains for them a special providence (construed to mean repentance and marriage)
And if two of your men commit themselves to the same evil line of conduct (homosexuality) do punish them both. But if they repent and abandon wrong-doing, then disregard their past act and do not reproach them to induce mental pain; Allah has always accepted true repentance and the atonement made by the people; He has always been Tawabun (Relenting) and Rahimun
Allah takes upon Himself to accept the repentance of those who commit themselves to an evil line of conduct proceeding from undue haste and want of thought and soon thereafter wake up. to the realization of the, consequence of the event and immediately feel contrition and in lowliest plight repentant stand. Such persons, shall Allah give up resentment against them and pardon their offence; Allah has always been 'Alimun and Hakimun
But in no case shall Allah take upon Himself to accept the repentance of those who consume their life in wrong - doing until the encounter with death when each of then will says: "Now do I repent," nor of those who are caught in the Jaws of death with minds captivated in disbelief. Such persons shall be denied Allah's forgiveness, and We have prepared for them a condign punishment
O you who have conformed to Islam women are not a property to be inherited against their will following the death of their husbands; you are forbidden to copy this pagan custom, nor are you allowed to ill treat them to force them to give up a part of the dower or of the property you have given them, unless they have been proven guilty of an evil line of conduct. And you must live with them in equity and honour according to the manner and the Islamic laws of matrimony. And should you take to them so much dislike; it may happen that you dislike something whereby Allah makes all grace abound
And if any of you decides to dissolve his marriage contract with his wife in favour of matrimonial union with another, and you had dowered your divorcee when you joined in wedlock with a talent of gold, you shall not recover the least part of it; would you reclaim what is their right by fraud and dishonesty and you stand manifest of deceit and falsehood
And how could you reclaim it when you have already entered into matrimony and communion with one another and your vows and solemn promise of allegiance and good will have been pledged to them before Allah
And do not marry the women whom your fathers (deceased or divorced) have married before; Allah shall drop into oblivion what happened in the past. This incestuous union has been regarded by Allah as-an immoral act, a degrading vice and an evil line of conduct
Forbidden are : your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal and maternal aunts, your nieces on the brother and sister's side, your foster - mothers, your foster- sisters, your mothers - in - law, your step -daughters with whose mothers you have consummated marriage, but you are absolved to marry them if you have annulled your unconsummated marriage to their mothers -your daughters-in- law whose husbands are your own sons who generated from your own loins. Nor can you effect a, matrimonial union with two sisters at the same time; bygone shall be bygone; the new era shall begin; indeed Allah has always been Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun
Nor can you marry the women who are married except the captives on hand; a prescriptive rule imposed by Allah on you to observe. But lawful unto you are all who are beyond this limiting provision, with the proviso that you seek to win, with your resources, the women of your choice to unite with them according to Islamic laws of matrimony and not according to vicious indulgence in sexual pleasures. And pay those of them whom you shall enjoy, their dowers; it is a duty incurred by such bond. Nonetheless you shall not fall into consequence if you mutually agree to give her more than what you have dutifully paid or you take back from her what she wishes to remit of her own accord; indeed Allah has always been 'Alimun and Hakimun
And those of you who do not have enough resources to marry the Muslim, -women who enjoy civil liberty, may turn the course and resort to the young unmarried Muslim women among those reduced to a servile state; and Allah Knows best those of you who justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will. You take them in marriage by permission of their guardians and pay them themselves, their dowers with good will, and choose those of them who are characterized with the attribute of chastity, faith and fidelity and ornamented with the flower of honesty and not enamoured of other men. And when once they are united in wedlock, they have to guard-themselves from being supposed (temptation). And should they commit themselves to an evil line of conduct, then they shall suffer for their offence, but their punishment shall be half that inflicted on free women for the same offence. Such course of action is ordained for those who are afraid to live in celibacy lest they commit themselves to an evil line of conduct and incur the undesirable consequence. And if you be patient and quietly await the course of events, it is better for you, and Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
Allah intends to indicate to you the best course of action and to guide you to divine providence and to the habits of life acquired by those who came to this world before you, and to give up resentment against you and pardon your offence. And Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun
But whereas Allah takes upon Himself to extend His mercy to you and give up resentment against you and pardon your offence, the wicked bred to the taste of lust appetent wish to see you alienate Allah's purpose and depart far distant from the path of righteousness
Allah means to unburden your minds and your conscience by ordaining what is compatible with your nature and to unburden to you the sins and sorrows of life, for man was created wanting in moral strength endurance, and resistance, lacking fortitude and courage, strength of purpose and will, and the weakest among you are often deceived by others
O you who have conformed to Islam: Do not eat your property out of each other in irreverence, wickedness, dishonesty and impiety (usury, gambling, cheating, adulteration, treachery, monopoly, bribery, embezzlement, stealing and such vices); this leads to a gradual self- destruction, unless it be a trade or exchange of commodities for a profit consented to by both the buyer and the seller. Nor shall you kill each other or commit self-murder; Allah is ever Rahimun to you
And he, who sinfully and wrongfully commits himself to such line of action, shall suffer grievously; We will subject him to a dreadful conflagration, and this is easy for Allah to do
If you avoid and refrain from committing the major sins which have been forbidden unto you, We will grant you remission for your iniquities and admit you into favour and grant you an honourable entry into the realm of bliss and the beatitude of heaven
Do not have a longing to the superior advantages or privileges Allah has gifted some of you above others. Men have a rightful claim to be apportioned the proper share of what they have earned (by labour or inheritance), and women have a rightful claim to be apportioned the proper share of what they have earned (by labour or inheritance) therefore, do not express yearning in an emotional voice after the privileges of others, nor suggest it secretly to the mind, but long for the bounty of Providence and show that you have fulfilled the requirements for deserving what you prayed for; Allah is ever 'Alimun of all in all
To all and each have We determined successors lawfully entitled to inherit what the parents and the kindred have left. But you must dutifully honour the pledges you vowed in the past to others in good will (heir presumptive, a slave released from bondage or a Muslim immigrant, whose right to the apportioned share of the heritage must not be defeated by a nearer heir), and keep in mind that Allah is Shahidun (a witness to all things)
Men are the tutelary guardians of women's interests and welfare by consequence of, the inherent constitutional qualities and attributes Allah has invested in one, above the other, and by virtue of the expenditure they incur. Virtuous women are obedient and' responsible, morally accountable for their deeds and capable of fulfilling an obligation and trust in their husbands' absence; virtues that accord well with divine principles. As to those of them whom you consider pervasive and you have a cause to fear, you simply exhort them and urge them by kind words to laudable conduct. Should they turn a deaf ear then absent yourselves from their society in bed. If they still sleep in the bed they have made, then beat them. But if they submit to your good will at any stage and surrender themselves to correction, then do not crush their feelings, their minds or their spirits; nor keep them under tyrannical exercise of power or burden them with cruel and unjust impositions or restraints; Allah is ever the Unique Whose attributes belong to the highest regions of thought and reality, the Unique Who is ever eminently entitled to the designation: The Supreme
And if you suspect a breaking of union or continuity between them or impending ruptured relations, then you may choose an arbitrator from his (husband's) side and an arbitrator from her (wife's) side, to whom both parties agree to refer their claims, in order to obtain an equitable decision. Should they both (man and wife) be willing to reconcile their differences and quarrels, then Allah shall reconcile them with their own hearts and make sympathy of love unite their thoughts; Allah has always been 'Alimun, and Khabirun (well acquainted with all that you are doing)
And worship Allah and do not incorporate with Him other deities, and commit your parents to your kind care and display to them and to the kindred who are related by blood and to the orphans a friendly and kind disposition. A similar disposition is extended to the poor and to the neighbour related or immediate, to the associate and to the wayfarer, and to those on-hand, whether they be captives or reduced to servile state. And do realize that Allah detests every boastful who exalts himself unduly and displays inordinate self-esteem
Those who are miserly, unwilling to give in benevolence or spend in divine service and induce others to be mean and parsimonious, and hide Allah's grace in whom it abounds, have in effect permitted the forbidden and commended it to others. We have prepared for those who bid defiance to Allah and rise defiant against His ordinances a condign and humiliating punishment
And those who spend of their wealth ostentatiously under the garb of benevolence only to attract notice and to win the admiration of people while in fact they believe neither in Allah nor in the Last Day, have bound themselves to their wicked kind and walked in the footsteps of those with characteristics befitting AL-Shaytan. And he who associates himself with the Devil, has in fact espoused evil, and evil indeed. Is the companion
What would they -the infidels- lose should they recognize Allah and be disposed to believe in the Last Day, and spend in divine service of what Allah has bestowed on them! Indeed Allah is ever aware of them, 'Alimun of all that they do
Allah is He who established the principle of Justice and established Himself as the fundamental and infinite source of justice; would He be unjust! Never in the least does Allah wrong anyone for the equivalent of an atom. And to induce people to justice, He mercifully requites the pious deed with. double what is commensurable with it, and He requites those who are faithful to Him with a great reward
How will it be if and when We call. Upon the Messenger of every nation to bear witness to his people's deeds, and We call upon you O Muhammad to bear witness to these people's actions
There and then shall those who denied Allah and/or His statutes and disobeyed the Messenger, wish they could be leveled in the dust, and not one fact can they hide from Allah. Intoxicants were forbidden in stages, here and elsewhere: 2:219, 5:90/91 If on the road and spiritually unconditioned and there is no water to bathe, then ablution -real or metaphoric - becomes an obligation
O you who conformed to Islam: Do not engage in the act of worship while you are under the influence of intoxicants nor pray when you are spiritually unconditioned, unless you are on the road, until you have bathed. And if you are sick or on the road or have defecated or touched women and the sensation or contact stirred you to passion, and you did not find water for ablution, then metaphoric ablution be a religious rite: apply clean sand, dust or dry earth lightly to your faces and hands; Allah is ever 'Afawun (Indulgent) and Ghafurun
Have you not seen O Muhammad into the irreverent disposition of those who had their share of the Book and of divine Knowledge, (Ahl al-Kitab), how they exchange the guidance of Providence to the path of righteousness for the perplexed path in the maze of error and wish you would alienate you from the purpose of Allah and err and stray from the path of righteousness
Allah knows best those who are at enmity with you who seek to injure you and afflict you, if they could, with an irretrievable disaster. But enough is Allah to be your Tutelary Guardian and enough be He to afford you help
Among those who are imbued with Judaism are some who translocation the words of the Sacred Scriptures to alter the intended sense of Allah's words. And they interpret their thoughts in words and in deeds; they say to you O Muhammad: "We have opened our hearts’ ears but their actions in fact to their words do not accord, featuring disobedience to which they give voice and insolently say: "We disobey". And they direct to you the words superficially denoting politeness and deep respect that you think they are saying: "We need you to apply your mind and your ears to us, and you are excused if you do not listen, but please attend to us." In point of fact the way they pronounce the words with their tongues in their cheeks (or in Hebrew) admits of secondary bad meaning and insult of the religion, thus: Listen, may you never hear and be afflicted with deafness, you are a thoughtless bad one. But had they said: "We open to you our hearts' ears and we obey, please listen to us and “unzurna” and direct your intellectual eye upon us;" it would have been much better for them and indeed honourable. But Allah has cursed them for their disobedience and their infidelity; how greatly shaken is their faith in Allah
O you to whom the Book had been given -Ahl al-Kitab-: Give credence to the Book -the Quran- We have revealed to Our Messenger Muhammad, corroborating and authoritatively validating the authentic Book AL-Tawrah you hold in possession, before We expunge faces, and wipe out their features beyond recognition and eclipse their splendour, or afflict you with such evils as indicate divine wrath and a malignant fate just as We had cursed those who broke the Sabbath Allah's. command has always come to pass
Never shall Allah forgive the impious irreverence of incorporating with Him other deities, but He forgives all else to whom He will. And he who incorporates with Allah other deities shall have committed the most heinous sin
Have you not seen Muhammad into the manner of those who vindicate themselves and justify their wrongs! But indeed it is only Allah Who has the absolute authority to vindicate whom He will, and no one is ever wronged not even to the equivalent of a single hair of the dry integument of the smallest seed
Look how they forge lies against Allah and criminally relate to Him falsehood which is enough to be sin personified
Have you not seen O Muhammad into the irreverent disposition of those who had their share of the Book and of divine knowledge -Ahl AL-Kitab- how they are strongly disposed to believe in falsehood rendering idolatrous worship to idols, priests, necromancers and to the Devil, and regard the infidels with admiration and consider them the guide - posts of faith when compared to those who took Providence their guide
These are they whom Allah has afflicted with such evils as indicate divine wrath and a malignant fate. He whom Allah has cursed shall find no one to afford him help
Or did they go shares with Allah in His sovereignty over the universe! But if they did, they would never have bestowed on mankind even as little as the speck in a date stone; they cannot bear to see others invested with privileges
Or do they envy people and regard their divine-given privileges with discontent! But We bestowed on Ibrahim (Abraham) and his family the divine prerogative of Prophethood, the Book and the wisdom that go with it and privileged them with sovereignty and a great kingdom
And among those to whom Ibrahim was sent, were some who recognized him and gave credence. to his faith, and others who declined to accept him. And enough is Hell to lay claim to those infidels to infuriate its blazes
Those who deny Our revelations and refuse to recognize Our signs serving to demonstrate divine, Omnipotence and Authority shall be put to torture; We will expose them to the protracted and dreadful conflagration. As often as their skins* are consumed, We replace them with new skins so that they taste the merciless but just punishment. Indeed Allah has always been Qadirun (Omnipotent) and Hakimun
But those who believed with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety shall be recipients of Allah's mercy and. blessings. We will welcome them into gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity. They shall be companioned with mates of their design, pure, chaste and holy, fellows of their piety, and shall be overshadowed with Allah's gracious wing affording security and protection while they experience, with great delight, the promised eternal bliss
Allah commands you to characterize yourselves with habitual reverence, obedience and piety and to restore the property and whatever you hold in trust, be, it from Allah or from people, to those who have the rightful claim to it and or -to those who have invested you with the trust. And exercise justice when you sit in judgement upon people, and be consonant with the principles of moral right and in accordance with reason and fact. Allah enjoins only what is right and sound; how morally excellent is what He exhorts you to do; Allah has always been Sami’un with (unlimited audition), and Bassirun, (He sees all that you do)
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Obey Allah and be submissive to His will and obey the Messenger who is the only medium through whom Allah's guidance, command, ordinance and word are conveyed and expressed. And obey those among you who are invested with authority. Nonetheless, should you seem resolved to dispute any subject or a concern, then resort to Allah’s Book –the Quran– and betake yourselves to the Messenger for aid if in fact your hearts have been impressed with image of religious and spiritual virtues and you are strongly disposed to believe that the Last Day is comfortable to reality. This is a wise course of action ensuring safety and leading to the intended purpose
Have you seen O Muhammad into the irreverent disposition of those who allege that they have given credence to all that has been revealed to you and to all that has been revealed to Messengers before you, how they wish to resort to the Devil and to false deities for judgement of their disputes! Yet they have been commanded to reject and renounce every deity besides Allah. But AL-Shaytan and those with characteristics befitting him intend to lead them by the nose into the maze of error
When advised to resort to the canon law sent by Allah to be the standard for judgement and to betake themselves to you -the Messenger- for aid, you see the hypocrites, actuated by repugnance, turn away their faces, their eyes and their thoughts from you
And so, how will it be if and when they are befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity in consequence of what their wrongful and unclean hands. have committed! There and then they shall betake themselves to you making a solemn declaration with an appeal to Allah that they meant nothing but peace upon earth and concord and good will unto men
These and such persons are they upon whom wickedness prevails; Allah is 'Alimun of the irreverence mustering to their hearts. Therefore, disregard O Muhammad what they say and exhort them and discourse them on practical divinity by words piercing their ears, their hearts and their feelings and touching their innermost being
Never did We send a Messenger but to be obeyed, Allah willing, and had they turned to Allah as soon as they had wronged themselves and betaken themselves to you to declare their invocation to Allah for forgiveness, and the Messenger -you Muhammad- had invoked Allah, on their behalf, for mercy and forgiveness, they would have found Allah Tawabun and Rahimun
But never, by Allah, your Creator, shall they be recognized as Muslims and be sanctioned by all solemnities of religion until they have willingly accepted you as the judge and/or the arbitrator. and accepted your judgement and submitted to your authority with submissive reverence, and reasoned high of Providence
And had Allah enjoined them to sacrifice their lives in His cause or to go out of their homes to fight against positive unbelief, they would not have obeyed the injunction with the exception of a few. Had they obeyed Allah's authoritative admonition, it would have been much better for them here and Hereafter. Such obedience would have confirmed their peace and position of authority and deep joy would have settled on their spirits
There and then they would have merited a great reward from heaven's realm
And moral straightness and the path of righteousness would have been all before them and, Providence their guide
He who obeys Allah and His Messenger shall be a recipient of Allah's mercy and blessings. Such persons shall be placed in the distinguished position of those in whom all divine grace abounds: the Prophets, the veracious, the martyrs and the pious in a world perverse, and how celebrated is the society
Such a distinguished position is a manifestation of Allah's grace, and enough is Allah to be 'Alimun of all in all
O you who have conformed to Islam: Take all precautions to provide against a surprise party and advance in single battalions or advance in regiment
Among you are those who detach themselves from your regiment in thought and action that if you happen to suffer loss or be wedded to a calamity, any one of them would say "Allah has been gracious to me, for I was guided by intuition to engage myself in a skirmish and irregular encounter and detach myself from the pursuit of their hostile action
But should victory sit on your helm, he interprets his thoughts in words, as if he is not bound by ties of affection, blood, interests or circumstances or with some fact or series of facts or attributes into which you both enter; he says "I wish I were a part of them, I would have achieved a great victory
Since among you O Muslims are the like of these aforementioned whose faith in Allah is greatly shaken, then let those of you who have the world all before them but choose to exchange it for the better world in heaven's realm Hereafter fight in the cause of Allah. Whether they lose their lives or victory sits on their helm, they shall merit Our blessings and We will repay them an imposingly beautiful reward
And why should you not fight in the cause of Allah when the helpless and the oppressed among the men, the women and the children give voice to their emotion and appeal to Allah for aid; they pray: "We pray and beseech you, O Allah, our Creator, to deliver us out of this City (Macca) whose inhabitants are espoused to tyranny and oppression, and confer on us Your tutelage and afford us Your help
Those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand fight in the cause of Allah whereas those who deny Allah and lose sight of Him, fight in the cause of the Devil. Therefore, fight O you Muslims the advocates of the irreverent system of worship instituted by AL-Shaytan who holds out his hand and they give their own. Indeed the cunning of AL-Shaytan is taken for a poor crooked wisdom
Have you not seen O Muhammad into the disposition of those who were told to put a restraint upon their desire for fighting and observe faithfully the act of worship and give Zakat (alms), for Zakat is but the vehicle of prayer, yet when time was ripe and fighting was enjoined, some of them came to be apprehensive about their involvement in battle for fear of their lives. They feared the enemy –to a degree comparable to the degree of fear due to Allah–Creator of all beings or even a degree higher, and they exclaimed against fighting; they said: "O Allah, our Creator, why enjoin us to fight and implant our Hereafter in the now; if only You would put fighting in respite and grant us a postponement of this obligation to a future date!" Say to them O Muhammad: "The enjoyment experienced here below, no matter how long it lasts, is fleeting and evanescent whereas the Hereafter abounds in the best enjoyments and everlasting bliss for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, and no one is ever wronged not even to the equivalent of a single hair of the dry integument of the smallest seed
Wherever you may be you shall be caught in the jaws of death even if you happen to be in fortresses fortified against confounding ages cruel knife. Yet when good fortune falls in their way, they -your people– relate it to Allah, and if they are befallen with a misfortune they relate it to you O Muhammad. Say to them: "All happenings, good or bad, are authorized by Allah." What ails these people that they hardly comprehend a discourse of reason
In effect whatever good fortune betide you is endowed with grace from the bounty of Providence, and whatever misfortune befalls you is the consequence of your own doings. We have sent you O Muhammad to the people as a Messenger, and enough is Allah to be a witness to all deeds and to the way they are effected
He who obeys the Messenger has in effect obeyed Allah, and he who turns a deaf ear must realize that We did not send you to watch over their innocence and folly
They -whose faith is greatly shaken- show obedience in your presence O Muhammad and say to you: "We obey all that you exhort us to do." But when they depart from where you are, some of them design by night a scheme of action not in accord with your principles, and Allah puts in writing all that they propose to do. Therefore, disregard them and rely upon Allah, and enough is He to be your Tutelary Guardian Who exercises protecting vigilance over you
Do they not ponder the Quran! If it were revealed from a source other than Allah, they would have found it abounding in discrepancies and variations
When -these people- learn by credible or incredible information a subject or report or talk to the credit of the Muslims or against them, they spread it as news and circulate it by way of rumour. Had they referred it to the Messenger and, in his absence, to those in authority among them, it would have been in accordance with divine standard. The Messenger and/or those in authority would have intelligently examined the news and rationalized the matter and would have known the facts and placed them in their true bearings. Had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you, you people would have been attracted to AL-Shaytan and espoused the opinions of those with characteristics befitting him, except a few
Therefore, fight O Muhammad in the cause of Allah; you are not responsible for anyone but yourself, But incite those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand to make war against positive unbelief; perhaps Allah may curb the hostile appetite of those infidels who wish to display their might against you. Allah's Omnipotence infinitely exceeds man's might and when He avenges His right He strikes at the root
He who mediates or intervenes for the purpose of reconciling persons shall have a share of his good grace allotted to him by Providence. And he who mediates with a bad grace and for the purpose of an evil cause and/or selfish motive principles shall share the consequences of his ill grace. There is Providence that watches over innocence and folly, and keeps a vigilant eye upon everything and every action
When you are greeted with words or gestures, acknowledge the greeting with a more courteous recognition or at least return the same formula; it is an obligation. Allah has always taken account of all things and all actions
Allah there is no Ilah but He, shall inevitably gather you all on the Day of Resurrection, the Day which admits no doubt; and who is more truthful in his discourse than Allah
How can you -Muslims- get to be divided in thought and in feeling, some in favour of and some against the hypocrites and you class injustice with wisdom and virtue, when Allah has already grouped them together under the. class – Infidels- for their common attributes and their qualities and actions which have earned Allah's hatred! Do you wish to guide those whom Allah has declined to guide to His path of righteousness! He whom Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness shall no one be able to guide thereto
They wished you would desert faith in favour of disbelief and be infidel as they are so that you be both alike. Therefore, do not make a friendly intimacy with them until they have emigrated as purposed by Allah and be resolved to fight in His cause. Should they turn a deaf ear, then beset them on all sides. and kill them wherever you find them and join none of them in intimacy nor lean upon any of them to afford you help
But exempt from aforesaid prescriptive right are those of them -the hypocrites- who take refuge with or are related to a people with whom you are bound by a covenant relating to peace, truce, alliance or the like or -those of them- who are perplexed by reason of their kinship to your opponents; they do not have the heart to fight on your side against their people nor to side with their people-against you. Had Allah willed, He, would have instigated them against you, and then they would have waged war against you. Therefore, if they are disposed to let you alone, proceed no further and offer you peace, then leave them alone; Allah does not commit you to any line of action against them
You shall also find others -hypocrites,- who wish to win your confidence as well as the confidence of their people - double face -; if victory sits on your helm, they apply their hearts to you, and if it sits on their people's helm, they apply their hearts to them and return to insurrection wherein they sink into vice under the vexations of their winds. Since, you have no binding agreement with their people, then unless they let you alone and proceed no further, offer you peace and curb their hostile appetite and withhold their wrongful hands, then beset them on all sides, kill them wherever you find them or whenever you gain mastery over them; Allah gives you, against them, a free hand and a complete liberty of action
Observe particularly: It is not right for a believer who has conformed to Islam to kill another believer of the same law unless it be by mistake. And he who kills a Muslim by chance and guilt does not reside in the intention shall run into some consequences in expiation of his wrong, thus
And he who kills a believer who has conformed to Islam and the guilt resides in the intention, shall be destined to Hell wherein he will have passed through nature to eternal suffering and he will have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and curse; this is besides the torment prepared by Providence to lay upon the damned
O you who have conformed to Islam: When you journey into a foreign land in Allah's cause, you must distinguish by the sight and by other senses the disposition of the people whether or not they have conformed to Islam lest you spoil your best designs by faulty actuation. Nor should you say to anyone who greets you: "You are not a Muslim;" prompted by selfish motive principles of considering him a fit subject for plunder, in quest of the fleeting and evanescent glory of life below when glory, valuables, possessions and all graces abound in heaven's realm. Remember, if he is not a believer in Allah, thus were you before but Allah graced you with guidance to His path of righteousness. Therefore, discern the truth from what is false; Allah is ever 'Alimun of all that you do
They are not alike, the stay-at-home for no valid reason (sickness, trouble and the like) and those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has invested those who strove with their wealth and their lives in His cause with special distinctions a step higher in the scale of dignity and rank than that He invested in the stay-at-home. Yet both did Allah promise efficacious grace effecting the end for which it is given. But those who strive shall Allah distinguish from the stay-at-home by quite a rich reward
These are grades of quality, disposition and attributes as determined and conferred by Him besides forgiveness and mercy, and Allah has always been ever Ghafurun and Rahimun
Those who are caught in the Jaws of death discrediting themselves with wrongful actions shall be questioned by the angels of death who disembody their souls, thus: "What has become of you, and what was your reaction to oppression and humiliation?" "The powerful citizens, oppressed the weak by tyrannical exercise of power" answer the wrongful "Was Allah's earth not extensive enough, to migrate into another country and come to settle therein!" ask the angels. Such persons are destined to Hell, and evil indeed is the intended end
But exempt from this -scheme of classification relative to the stay- at home are the men who are deficient in bodily vigour through age, the women and the children who are deficient in bodily or muscular strength who have no stratagem to use against the enemy or be able to lead in a course of action nor determine the course of events
Such persons may be excused, and Allah may hopefully give up resentment against them; Allah has always been 'Afuwan and Ghafurun
And he who emigrates in the cause of Allah (because of persecution, oppression or the like) shall find a good many places of refuge and abounding resources. and he who quits his homeland with the motive principle of serving Allah's purpose and subserving His Messenger shall win Allah's grace. And if it happens that he comes upon the encounter with death on the way, before he has reached his destination he shall be graced just the same; his reward has thus early been incumbent on Allah
And if you journey into a foreign land, be it in the cause of Allah or for any other purpose, you incur no guilt if you should shorten your prayer (one time kneeling, twice prostrating performed twice instead of three or four times), that is if you fear you might be exposed to a willfully inflicted injury by those who are an open enemy of the faith. Therefore, be cautious; the infidels are indeed your avowed enemy
And if you Muhammad happen to be with them -the Muslims- and it is time to observe a scheduled prayer, then you perform your act of worship as herein indicated: "You lead the prayer with some of them (first group) who shall remain carrying their weapons while the others (second group) stand sentinel to keep guard ever you in the rear. When you have completed the first division-one time kneeling, twice prostrating then the first group withdraws to the rear to replace those in the second group who now join you during your second division at the end of which you Muhammad will have completed your two divisions Now there remains one division for each group to perform. The first group (armed) now performs the second division with the second group standing guard over them in the rear. Then both groups reverse their position until each group will have completed their two divisions being cautious at all times. The infidels wish you would neglect your arms and your equipment so that they attack you once for all. Yet you are absolved to lay down your arms if it rains or if you fall sick, but be constantly on your guard. Allah has prepared for the infidels a tormenting punishment humiliating indeed
When you have completed your prayer, you keep remembering Allah and bearing Him in mind standing, sitting and lying on your sides. Evoking reminiscence of Allah inspires to the hearts and minds a state, of composure. However, when you feel safe and secure, you then perform the act of worship in the proper manner as prescribed by Allah, for the act of worship has been a prescriptive rule incumbent on those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand to observe at the scheduled hours
And do not relax in point of strictness and severity nor weaken in your fighting power against those who are an open enemy of the faith. If you are suffering misery and hardship, they are suffering just the same, but unlike them, you are hopeful of Allah's tutelage, mercy and blessings whereas they are staking their very lives on some dark hope. And Allah is ever 'Alimun and Hakimun
We have revealed to you O Muhammad the Book –the Quran– in truth and in agreement with reality so that you Judge between the people in the manner shown to you by Allah. And so do not be deceived by the wicked who attempt to prejudice you and deceive you into using your authority to favour and vindicate those characterized with treachery
And invoke Allah's forgiveness; Allah has always been ever Ghafurun and Rahimun
Nor should you plead on behalf of those who deceive their own minds, their views and their hopes and assert what is false and lead others into error; Allah detests the one who deceitfully violates faith and betrays trust, whose name has become a byword of perfidy and crime
They hide their evil deeds to conceal them from the notice of others, but how can they conceal them from the notice of Allah when He is Omnipresent. Their reasoning when they are alone. at night admits a discourse to their dishonesty and to their disposition against the principles of Allah. But Allah's Omnipresence besets them on all sides and it follows that He has always been Cognizant of all that they do
There, you people have pleaded on their behalf here below, but who is going to plead on their behalf on the Day they rise again and come to Allah's final judgment, or who shall then take them under his tutelage and be their defender
Yet he who commits himself to an evil line of conduct or wrongs himself and invokes Allah's forgiveness and mercy, shall find Allah has always been ever Ghafurun and Rahimun
And he who commits himself to an evil line of conduct will have in effect committed it but against his own soul and to the hurt of his own interest and Allah has always been ever 'Alimun and Hakimun
And he who makes a mistake or does something in a manner contrary to equity and uprightness or commits a crime and hides his guilty front with innocent snow and throws the blame or lays it on someone who is innocent, shall have burdened himself with, the guilt of intentional assertion of falsehood and of standing before Allah manifest of crime
And had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you Muhammad some of those who mistake their way and do not employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions would have resolved to lead you in the wrong, when in fact they will only mislead themselves. Nor, even though they desire to harm you, can they get you into harm's way. Allah has revealed to you the Book -the Quran- to guide you and acquaint your heart with wisdom and He imparted to you the knowledge of what you at no time knew, and Allah's grace and blessings on you have been indeed abounding
There is nothing useful nor reliable for a purpose or efficient in a function in much of their secret counsel and in the thoughts they convey reciprocally in talk uttered below their breath unless it be in accord with wisdom and piety that it enjoins benevolence, equity and the inducement to peace among people and the principles of justice. And he whose lines of character are broad and clear as to feature willingness to comply with divine principles for the sake of piety shall be a recipient of Allah's grace; We will requite him with a great reward
And he who contends with the Messenger with opposing arguments after he has clearly sensed the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and follows a path other than that followed by those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand and Providence their guide shall be a great loser. We will confirm him in the horrid purpose he has chosen for himself and will confix him to a dreadful conflagration. And evil indeed is the intended end
Never shall, Allah forgive the impious irreverence of incorporating with Him other deities, but He forgives all else to whom He will. And he who incorporates with Allah other deities shall have lost himself in the maze of error
They simply pay reverence and veneration to idols designated by female appellations -goddesses- and invoke them besides Allah. It is a visible manifestation of Al-Shaytan and an attribute they wear chiefly by his instrumentality. In fact they invoke and reverence none but the Devil who is evil personified
Allah has cursed him and afflicted him with such evils as indicate divine wrath and a malignant fate. His insolence was such as to promise, Allah to incite a determinate number of His servants to evil
I will lead them wrong," he said, "and I will lead them by the nose to an evil line of conduct and arouse in them vain desires and stir up their sinful sensuous appetite." "I will command them to receive the pagan superstition and slit and cut the ears of cattle and I will command them to change the course and order of things wherein they were set at the creation." And he who puts himself under the tutelage of AL-Shaytan besides Allah, shall have been a great loser
He promises them and arouses in them vain desires when in fact he promises them only what is vain, deceptive and deluding
Such persons are destined to make abode in Hell whereat the flames shall lay upon them a sure watch that they just cannot escape
But those who conformed to the will of Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety shall be requited with what is commensurate with their deeds. We will welcome them into gardens of bliss beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, a solemn promise made by Allah, and who is more truthful in his discourse than Allah Who is truth personified
Hope springs eternal in the human breast; the hope of some reward whether merited or unmerited, peculiar to man, is a desire with expectation not according with Allah's legislative and religious code. Therefore, it is neither according to your desires O Muslims nor is it according to the desires of Ahl AL-Kitab (Jews and Christians) that Allah proceeds. He who commits himself to an evil line of conduct shall be punished for it and suffer for his offence; he shall not find besides Allah a tutelary guardian nor can anyone afford him help
And whoever, a male or a female with a faithful heart, in all manner of wisdom and piety does something involving effort to gain one's livelihood. or to perform a function, or acting upon the feelings of others or for any purpose so as to gain an end. shall be a recipient of Allah's mercy and blessings. Such persons shall be heartily welcomed into Paradise and never shall they be wronged not even as little as the speck in a date stone
And who has a better cosign of vantage affording piety of action and system of faith and worship than he who surrenders himself, his purpose and his reason to Allah. conforming his will to Allah's will while he imprints his deeds with wisdom and piety and follows the system of faith and worship of Ibrahim the orthodox Muslim, whom Allah has distinguished by His unique tutelary friendship
And to Allah belong all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and Allah has always been Cognizant of all things
And they – those who conformed to Islam - seek counsel from you O Muhammad concerning women; how to act toward them and deal Justly with them! Say to them: "Allah's decretal reply to your question, relative to women, is formally announced," “Instructions have been recited to you from the Book -the Quran–". Further instructions concern the female orphans to whom you deny their due and whom you wish to marry: "It is not right to take advantage of their helpless position nor of the helpless position of all those who are young." "And you must deal justly with orphans and exercise your authority in maintenance of their right. And whatever deed you imprint with wisdom and piety is an honourable deed, it always comes to Allah’s knowledge
And if a woman be apprehensive about her husband's ill treatment and she fears his aversion and cruelty or desertion, they incur no blame should they reconcile their quarrel and reconcile themselves with their own hearts and with Allah, for, the action of reconciling persons is consistent with piety. What prejudice the minds are greed or cupidity and non-admission of a point claimed in argument or of conceding anything asked or required. But if you turn your thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you shall find that Allah has always been Khabirun of all that you do
You shall never be able to do equity and justice to women in case of plurality of wives however much you wish, in good conscience, to do so. Therefore, do not disincline yourselves altogether from any of them acting upon your volition or upon a stronger volition than your own to keep her in suspense and mental anguish. And if you set estranged persons at one again and bring them back into concord and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, you shall find that Allah has always been ever Ghafurun and Rahimun
And should they decide to separate and bring to an end their conjugal cohabitation, then Allah shall make them independent of each other. He will compensate to each of them out of His bounty which flows freely and abundantly from the fountains of His grace what has been lost. Great, is Allah the Creator; He has always been Wasi’un (Omnipresent), His mercy is vast and Hakimun, His wisdom infinite
And to Allah belong all that is in the heavens and that is on earth, and We have enjoined those who were given the Book before you -Ahl AL-Kitab- as well as you Muslims to entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah. And if you should deny Allah and refuse to acknowledge His infinite Authority, then you must realize that to Allah belong all that is in the heavens and all, that is on earth, and Allah has always been Ghaniyun (Independent), (Absolute), and Hamidun (Worthy of all praise); His grace abounds in the universe
And to Allah belong all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and enough is Allah to be your Tutelary Guardian Who exercises protecting vigilance over you
If He wills, He can do away with you people and replace you, by others; and Allah is ever Qadirun to bring this to effect
And whoever sets his mind upon the mundane things which minister to his enjoyment and content here below must realize that in heaven's realm does Allah have all that ministers to his enjoyment and content here below and all the divine things which conduce to His mercy and grace Hereafter; Allah has always been ever Sami’un and Bassirun with unlimited audition, He sees all that you do
O you who have conformed to Islam: "Charge yourselves with equity and recourse to the principles of justice and exercise your authority and power in maintenance of right, though it may be against yourselves, your parents, or your kindred, and do not be inclined to favour the rich for a gain nor the poor for sympathy. Rich or poor as they may be, Allah is He who is more capable of guarding their interests. Therefore, do not be influenced by emotion nor let the ruling passion conquer reason and sway you from justice. And if you should swerve from this course of action or turn a deaf ear, you must realize that Allah has always been ever Khabirun of all that you do
O you who have conformed to Islam: Believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and acknowledge His Messenger and give credence to the Book He has sent down to him- the Quran- and to the Book He sent down before. And he, who denies Allah, His angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Day of Resurrection, shall have erred and strayed far deep in the maze of error
Indeed, those who conformed to Islam then turned renegades, then again conformed to Islam and again went over from Islam and sank deeply in disbelief under the unjustifiable vexations of their minds and spirit shall be undone past all retrieve whichever way they turn. Never shall Allah forgive them nor guide them to the path of righteousness
Announce O Muhammad to the hypocrites that they must expect a condign punishment
Those of you who take the infidels who deny Allah as intimate friends and favour their tutelage to that of their co-religionists who are of the same law, had better pause to think. Do they seek honour and power at their hands and pride themselves in so doing! But all power, omnipotence and honour rest on the helm of Allah's hands
Allah has instructed you in the Book -the Quran- He revealed to you, thus: "Should you happen to hear Allah's revelations challenged and denied and held up to ridicule by those who were born to be losers, then you do not keep company with them until they have changed the subject of conversation and virtue and wisdom no longer sit in want, lest you be alike." Allah shall gather the hypocrites and the infidels who deny Him all together in the kingdom of Hell
Such persons are they who watch you closely and they are on the watch for opportunities. If Allah graces you with His tutelage and victory sits on your helm, they desire with expectation to share the credit and they interpret their thoughts in words; they say to you: "Have we not been on your side!" And if the infidels who deny Allah are befallen with good fortune they say to them: "Did we not back you up and avert the disaster which would have befallen you at the hands of the Muslims?" Allah shall judge between you on the Day of Resurrection and Judgement and never shall Allah advantage the cause of the infidels over that of the Muslims
The hypocrites represent to themselves in imagination that they deceive Allah, while He is 'Alimun of all their doings and only gives them enough rope to allow them free scope of action in order that they commit themselves to an evil line of conduct. When they stand to perform their act of worship they are dispirited and despondent; they perform their prayer only to attract notice and win the admiration of people, while in truth they hardly remember Allah
Reticent, they are swayed, in their opinions and their actions, in their conduct and in their thoughts between you people - the Muslims - and their people - the infidels - while in truth they belong neither to you nor to them. And he whom Allah does not guide to the path of righteousness, never shall you find out a way to guide him thereto
O you who have conformed to Islam: Do not, take the infidels who deny, Allah as intimate friends and favour their tutelage to that of your co-religionists who are of the same law. Would you like that Allah takes a fault upon you and then He shall have a justifying reason to punish you
Indeed, the hypocrites are destined to the abode in the deep bottomless abyss of Hell, and never shall you find anyone to afford them help
But such a misfortune would be cancelled in favour of those who repent, amend and declare the truth and turn their minds to Allah and choose to be under His tutelage and faithfully conform to Allah's system of faith and worship. Such persons, shall Allah include in the circle of those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand, and Allah shall requite the faithful who are firm in fidelity and allegiance to Him a great reward
Pause here - you people - and think What advantage or benefit does Allah derive from inflicting punishment on you if you impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness and conform your will to His will! Indeed Allah has always acknowledged what is esteemed a worthy deed; and He is 'Alimun
Allah abhors words uttered in immoral manner and detests open contempt cast at others unless it be redressing grievances, and Allah is ever Sami’un with unlimited audition, and 'Alimun
Whether you make your wise and pious deed publicly known or you conceal it from the notice of others, or if you forgive and give up resentment against an offender and/or remit the penalty of an offense, you must realize that Allah has always been 'Afawun, and Qadirun
Indeed, those who deny Allah and refuse to acknowledge His Messengers and wish to dissociate them from Allah asunder in thought and in reverence and interpret their thoughts in words that they recognize some and decline to accept others, and wish to take a middle course, are they who were born to be losers
These and such persons are the infidels indeed, and We have. prepared for the infidels who deny the truth and intentionally assert what is false a condign and humiliating punishment
Whereas those who believe in Allah and recognize His Messengers with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and do not discriminate one from another, shall be recipients of the grace of Allah Who shall requite them with what is commensurate with their deeds, and Allah has always been Ghafurun, and Rahimun
And insolently do Ahl al-Kitab (the Jews) ask you O Muhammad for a Book that you would cause to descend upon them from heaven! But greater was their irreverence to Mussa (Moses) whom they asked to show them Allah personally so that they perceive Him by sight. There and then did heaven thunder against them and the fearful echoes thundered in their ears in consequence of their blasphemy against Allah. And worse was the reverence and veneration they paid to the calf which they worshipped and adored besides Allah. And this odd disposition, strangely ran in their heads after they had received enough signs to guide them out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment Yet We pardoned them and remitted the penalty of their serious offence and We conferred on Mussa delegated power and made him stand manifest of authority
And We stabilized the Mount above them when it shook with such fits of awe for the profound reverence dutiful to Allah as We made a covenant with them, and We said to them: “Make entry into this town AL-Quds (Jerusalem) but humble yourselves and bow your knees to Me as you go through the gate." And We said to them: "Do not break the Sabbath We set apart for rest and worship," and We entered with them into a paramount covenant and they, with a strong oath, expressed their obligation and solemn promise to bind themselves by it
Yet, set to their discredit were such crimes that brought them within the measure of Allah's wrath
Also, their infidelity and their slanderous discourse against Maryam - Blessed Virgin Mary- ( B.V.M)
And their false allegation that they slew the Messiah, Isa, the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah, when in fact they never killed him nor did they crucify him but they thought they did (See introduction). And those who disputed his fate were themselves in a state of uncertainty as to the truth and reality of the incident; their belief was based on empty knowledge and their supposition was formed on grounds admittedly insufficient, for indeed they just did not slay him but the guilt nevertheless resided in the intention
But Allah had taken him up to His August presence, and Allah has always been Azizun (almighty) and Hakimun
And there is no one, among Ahl al-Kitab but shall realize the truth of his - Isa's - mission at his descent to earth before his death - pining regrets and vain repentance - (The favoured view). And in Day of Judgment shall he - Isa - be a witness against them
And in consequence of their iniquities and wrongful actions, We denied them some good and wholesome victuals which were lawful to them aforetime, not to mention their frequent standing in the way to pervert Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth
Also, their ill gotten gain from usury which they have been utterly forbidden to practice and their unlawful organized scheme to eat people out of their property. And We have prepared for those of them who are disobedient rebels a condign punishment
But those of them with well-founded knowledge who are acquainted with the facts, whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand, are they who give credence to all that has been revealed to you Muhammad and to all that was revealed to those who were sent before you; they constantly observe their act of worship and give alms, they believe in Allah and in the Day of Resurrection with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. It is those whom We shall requite with a great reward
We have inspired to you O Muhammad a Book and a divine message as We inspired to Nuh (Noah) and to the prophets who followed. And We inspired divine messages to Ibrahim and Ismail (Ishmael), to Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya'qub (Jacob) and to the tribes of his twelve sons, to Isa and Ayub (Job), to Yunus (Jonas) and Harun (Aaron) and to Sulayman. And to Dawud We imparted the Psalms
And We inspired divine messages to Messengers whom We have narrated to you before and to others whom We did not narrate to you. And to Mussa did Allah speak as He exposed Himself to his - mental view and to him He declared the divine message in words
Such Messengers were sent as spectacles and warnings so that people shall have no excuse nor can they hold a plea against Allah in mitigation of censure after they had been warned by Allah's Messengers. And Allah has always been Azizun and Hakimun
But Allah is a witness of all that He has revealed to you O Muhammad and with it He has been associated. He sent it down by His authority and to this effect do the angels bear witness, and enough is Allah Himself to be the witness
Indeed, those who denied Allah and stood in the way to prevent Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth have been led by the nose into the depth of the maze of error
And those who denied Allah. and were wrongful of actions, were born to be losers; never shall Allah forgive them nor guide them to the path. of righteousness
But only to the path which leads directly to Hell wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering. And this is indeed quite easy for Allah to bring into effect
O you people: the Messenger of Allah has come to you with the divine message of the truth authorized by Allah, therefore, you had better conform to Allah's system of faith and worship. And if you should deny Allah and the mission of His Messenger, then you must realize that to Allah belong all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and Allah has always been 'Alimun, and Hakimun
O you Ahl AL-Kitab, Do not carry your religious beliefs to excess and beyond the truth, nor should you relate to Allah but the truth, Isa, the son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah, is simply His Word and edict He authoritatively proclaimed to Maryam and a spirit that proceeded from Him and was conveyed to Maryam by the Spirit Jibril (Gabriel). Therefore, you had better believe in Allah and acknowledge His Messengers and stop saying "Allah in Trinity;" this is only to your benefit. Allah is only and absolutely One, glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes; far be He beyond comprehension; His omnipotence precludes begetting a son , when all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth belong to Him. And enough is Allah to be your Tutelary Guardian Who exercises protecting vigilance over you
Indeed, the Messiah, Isa, the son of Maryam, shall not turn indignant for being a servant of Allah nor shall the angels nearest to Allah. And he who turns indignant for serving Allah and becomes extravagant in his account of himself and displays inordinate self - esteem must realize that all in all shall be thronged to His August Presence in Day of Judgment
But those who believed in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety, shall Allah requite with what is commensurate with their deeds, and out of His bounty He shall complement their rewards with what runs higher than what corresponds with their piety. Whereas those who turned indignant and displayed inordinate self-esteem, He shall requite with a condign punishment, and never shall they find besides Allah a tutelary guardian, nor can anyone afford them help
O you people: Now has a proof come to you from Allah, your Creator; a proof convincing the minds of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, and We have sent down to you illumination and enlightenment
Therefore, those who accepted Allah with consenting minds and chose to be under His tutelage, He shall admit their claim to His blessings and extend to them His mercy, grace them with His bounty and guide them to His path, the path of righteousness
They -your people- seek counsel from you O Muhammad concerning the deceased who is childless and fatherless. Say to them: "Allah’s decretal reply to your question concerns the childless and fatherless is formally announced, thus: If a man dies and he has no child nor a father but he has a sister, then she has the rightful claim to one half of what he has left." And should the reverse be the case then he inherits all her property if she has no child. And if the deceased in question has two sisters or more, then they go share and share alike in two thirds of what he left. And if they are a mixed company of men and women - brothers and sisters, then the general principle of inheritance applies; the male inherits the equivalent of what is apportioned to two females. Allah sets forth for you in detail the principles governing hereditary succession to property so that you do not go wrong, and Allah is 'Alimun of all in all
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Keep to your word and fulfill the obligations to Allah and to one another an oath, a promise, a contract, an agreement, a duty, matrimony, conduct, an act and the like. Commandments expressed by Allah represent His will relative to the conduct of His intelligent creatures. Thus, Allah rendered lawful the flesh of camels, cows, sheep and the live animals reared for food excepting those designated forbidden. Nor are you permitted to chase wild animals or game while you are on pilgrimage -major or minor- nor in the environs of the Sacrosanct Mosque. Allah ordains what He will
O you whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues: Do not desecrate Allah’s religious rites* nor violate the Sacred Month** (unless attacked) or interfere with the offerings, nor disturb the garlands mantling them identifying the sacrifice nor obstruct the way against those seeking grace, being bound for the Sacrosanct House betaking themselves to Providence for His bounty. And when you have concluded the proceedings of Allah’s religious rites and divested yourselves of the pilgrim's garb and moved away from the environs of the Sacrosanct House, you may engage in the chase if you like. And let not your hatred of a people, once your enemies who malevolently obstructed your way to the Sacrosanct House, stir your emotions to retaliate. And unite in good will to effectuate moral virtue and piety and not in sin, transgression and impiety, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; Who punishes severely
Forbidden unto you are carrion and blood, flesh of swine and flesh of the animal found strangled and the slaughtered under the invocation of a name other than Allah’s Name, flesh of an animal beaten to death and the one that died by a fall, the gored to death and the victim to a carnivore unless it be slaughtered in time, and the flesh of the animal sacrificed on the altars –idolism-. And you are forbidden to divide meat among you by divination and raffling by arrows, this is indeed impiety. This day have the infidels lost hope of alienating you from Allah’s purpose and divine principles, Therefore, do not fear them but fear Me. Today have I complemented for you your religion and made all grace abound in you. And I have chosen for you Islam as the acceptable system of faith and worship But he who is forced, by reason of hunger and want of lawful food, to eat of the forbidden, and not by willful transgression of Allah’s commandments nor does disobedience reside in the intention, shall find Allah Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
They call upon you O Muhammad for information relative to what has been rendered lawful. Say to them: Allah has rendered lawful what is worthy, good and wholesome, and the prey of the trained beasts of chase - animal or bird- trained to go in chase of the game you hunt as hounds are trained in the manner Allah has taught you; you may eat the flesh of the game they catch but under the invocation of Allah’s Name over it when you release the hound and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; Allah is swift indeed in executing the law
As of this day has Allah rendered lawful for you all articles of food that are worthy, good and wholesome, and the food of Ahl AL-Kitab as your food is to them. And it is lawful for you to marry the virtuous Muslim women and women among those who had been given the Book before you(Ahl Al-Kitab) who lift to Allah their inward sight when you have paid them their due dowers intending to live together in matrimony and not as illicit partners nor as concubines. And those who reject faith shall their hopes be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness here and Hereafter where they shall be among the great losers
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: When you intend to perform your act of worship, ablution becomes a duty. Wash your faces , your hands and the forearms up to the elbows, and with your wet hands wipe your heads, then wash your feet to the ankles. And if you are spiritually unconditioned following sexual congress or seminal emissions then purify yourselves to render the obligation "pure": you bathe before you pray. But if you are sick or on a journey or have defecated or touched women and the sensation of contact stirred you to passion, and you found no water, metaphoric ablution becomes a religious rite: apply clean sand, dust or dry earth lightly to your faces and hands. Allah does not intend to put you in difficulty but to set you upon the course of purity of thought and action, for the actions of men are the best interpreters of their thoughts. He means to make all grace abound in you that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness and lift to Him your inward sight
And call to mind Allah’s favour upon you and His covenant you subscribed to when you declared* that you heard and you obeyed the divine command to bind yourselves to the oath of fidelity to His Prophet. Entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; He is indeed 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all private thoughts and feelings reposted in the breasts
O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues : Stand guard over Allah’s purpose and make it your aim. And when you are called upon to bear witness to an incident or to a statement or the like, let your attestation be applied to the inward testimony of the conscience reflecting justice and equity. And let not your hatred of a people induce you to injustice. Assert the truth and be consonant with the principle of moral right, and remember that justice is closely associated with piety and that only the actions of the just smell sweet and blossom in the dust. And entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; He is 'Alimun of all that you do
Allah has promised forgiveness to those who believed in Him with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety. He shall pardon their past iniquities and grace them with a great meritorious reward
Whereas those who rejected faith and denied Allah and refused to recognize His revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority, shall be the inmates of Hell wherein they shall have passed through nature to eternal suffering
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: render solemn acknowledgement of Allah’s divine favour upon you when an organized group of infidels intended to lay their violent hands upon you and He held back their hands. And entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, and in Allah should those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust
And for once did We -Allah- enter into a covenant with Bani Isra‘il and We set among them twelve head men -of Ya’qub’s (Jacob’s) posterity- to set watch over the fulfillment of the divine agreement thus : "I will be with you and uphold you with the proviso that
Yet, set to their discredit was the crime of breaking the divine covenant which brought them within the measure of Allah’s wrath; We poured upon them maledictions and rendered them hard-hearted. They translocation the words of the Sacred Scriptures to alter Allah’s words and willfully neglect a part of what was imparted to them. And thus still you sense O Muhammad deception as the principal ingredient in their disposition with the excepting a few among them who lift to Allah their inward sight. Nonetheless, accord them forgiveness and do not entertain them with thoughts of ill-will; Allah likes those who turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence
And with those who declare themselves Christians, We entered into a covenant: Never deviate from the path of righteousness and adhere faithfully to the authentic Scriptures. But they willfully neglected a part of what was imparted to them. In consequence, We stirred up enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection. Allah shall inform them of their habitual course of action relevant to their evil deeds, and punish them accordingly
O you Ahl AL-Kitab: There came to you Our Messenger to make intelligible to you much of what you have concealed of the Scriptures so that. You apprehend what is purely spiritual and intellectual, and to repeal much of what is now irrelevant. Indeed there came to you intellectual illumination and enlightenment and a Book standing manifest of glory, knowledge and spiritual light
A Book, the spirit of truth guiding those who lift to Allah their inward sight into all truth, leading them to the path of safety and peace and guiding them, Allah willing, out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into intellectual illumination and enlightenment and directing them to the path of righteousness
Infidels indeed are those who declare: " Allah is the Messiah, ‘Isa, the son of Maryam". Say to them O Muhammad "Who then can restrain Allah if He willed to do away with the Messiah, ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, his mother and all those domiciled on earth! To Allah, alone, belong all that is in the heavens and on earth and all in between; He brings into being whatever He will; He is indeed Qadirun (Omnipotent) to effect all things
The Jews and the Christians say: "We are the sons of Allah and His beloved ones". Say to them Muhammad: "Why then does He punish you and afflict you with pain and suffering in requital for your evil deeds! Indeed you are but creatures constituting a part of those He brought into being and caused to exist. He forgives whom He will and torments whom He will. To Him alone belong all that is in the heavens and on earth and all in between. He is the end and the purpose for which all are destined
O you Ahl AL-Kitab: There came to you Our Prophet after a period of time - about six hundred years- intervening between him and his predecessor, to make intelligible, to you the facts and help you abandon imagination often at war with reason and fact so that you will not claim innocence saying: "No one came to us in the capacity of a spectacle and a warning". There he is -the Prophet Muhammad- in your midst, who has been sent to you all as a spectacle and a warning, and Allah is Qadirun to effect all in all
And for once Mussa (Moses) said to his people: "My people render solemn acknowledgement of Allah’s divine favour upon you; how He raised in your midst Prophets and conferred on you sovereignty and made all grace abound in you and graced you with favours and privileges and such prerogatives He never bestowed on other people
My people" he added "make entry into the holy land Allah decreed it be yours, and do not turn back lest you come to be losers
They said to him "O Mussa, but it is inhabited by people of great might who enforce their will, and we dare not make entry until they have departed therefrom; if they do, then we will make entry on
There and then said two of the men who entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, whom Allah has graced -thought to be Yashu’ (Joshua) and Caleb; Yashu’ succeeded Mussa in leadership forty years later.- Make a sudden entry by the proper gate, and once you are in, victory shall sit on your helm. "In Allah you put your trust if indeed you believe in Him with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Thus still they said to Mussa: "O Mussa, we shall never make entry therein so long as they are within; you go along with Allah, your Creator and fight them yourselves; we are staying here
There and then prayed Mussa: "O Allah, my Creator", he said: "I have no jurisdiction over any but myself and my brother, we leave them to You to judge between us and those wrongful of actions and to ordain what You will
In response Allah said: "Forbidden unto them shall this land be for forty years, wandering restlessly not knowing where to go nor in quest shall they know of what, Therefore, do not grieve O Mussa over those who grow daily more and more wicked
And relate to -the Jews- O Muhammad, the true narrative of the two sons of Adam, -Habil and Kabil- each of them made an offering to Allah hoping to be recipients of His blessings. But Allah accepted the oblation of one and not the other. Vexed at the good fortune of his brother, the latter said to the former: "I will kill you". And there said the former: "But Allah accepts the deeds of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Should you be tempted", he continued, "to lay your violent hands upon me to kill me, never will I lay violent hands upon you to kill you; I fear Allah, Creator of the worlds
In fact", he added, "I wish you would bear the consequences of my iniquities and of your wrongs and be an inmate of Hell, for this is the reward of those, wrongful of actions
He succumbed to his evil thought of slaying his brother and he killed him, only to incur the loss of the noble qualities of the soul and be one of those born to be losers
Unable to handle the corpse of his brother, he was at a loss. There and then did Allah send a raven to remove earth with its claws to bury a dead raven so that the killer would know how to dispose of his brother's corpse? The raven having shamed him with its notable performance, he said: "Woe betide me; have I not been even able to be like this raven to dispose of my brother’s corpse and obstruct the view of my crime! " And there he was left with nothing but pining regrets and vain repentance
By reason of this We ordained to Bani Isra‘il thus: "He who deprives an innocent life not implicated in homicide, corruption or mischief on earth, will have committed, as it were, massacre of all innocent people". "And he who preserves it and defends it will have protected, as it were, all innocent people". Our Messengers came to them equipped with clear signs to implement Our statues, yet many among them continued to carry disobedience and mischief to excess
The only reward befitting those who strive against Allah and His Prophet, wage spiritual warfare against Allah’s and strive to spread mischief on earth, is capital punishment or crucifixion, contra lateral amputation of their hands and legs or exile from the land, This way, they shall be put to shame here below, and there awaits them the torment laid upon the damned Hereafter
But such ill fate would be cancelled in favour of those who repent before you subvert them and reduce them to impotence, and you must realize that Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and seek the path leading to Him and make His purpose the heart of your purpose and strive in His cause; you may hopefully prosper
Those who deny Allah shall be paid their deserts. If they had owned twice the worldly riches and the affluence treasured on earth to offer in expiation of their guilt and of the torment to be laid on the damned in Day of Judgment, shall find that their hopes are doomed to disappointment. Never shall their ransom be accepted and there awaits them an unremitting punishment
They eagerly wish to get out of Hell, but never shall they succeed and therein shall they suffer excruciating pain
As to the thief, man or woman, who criminally and inexcusably commits a theft - whether by violence or by stealth, - you must make them suffer the amputation of their hands in requital of their iniquity; a punishment justified by Allah to set an example to others who are tempted to rob people of their property or plunder a person feloniously of something belonging, and Allah is Azizun (Almighty) and Hakimun (Wise)
But he or she who feels contrition following iniquity and regrets the wrongful action and in lowliest plight repentant stands and remorse begets reform, and their thoughts be governed by divine principles, shall Allah pardon them for their offence and give up resentment against them Hereafter
Do you not know that to Allah alone, belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth! He punishes whom He will and forgives whom He will, and He is Qadirun over all things
O you, the Messenger: "Let not those hypocrites who impel themselves heedlessly to infidelity grieve you at heart; their words and thoughts do not together accord. They declare they have conformed to Islam when in fact their hearts entertain positive unbelief. Nor should you grieve over those of the Jews who are attentive hearers to falsehood which the demagogic rabbins had purposed that they know. Furthermore, they lend their ears to those among them who never had audience of you, who translocation the words of the Sacred Scriptures to alter the intended sense of Allah’s words, and they use their authority to instruct their listeners to accept only the Scriptural passages they discoursed them, and to reject and beware of all else. But the fact is that he whom Allah has justly intended to close his heart’s ears and his mind’s eyes; you shall not be able to provide him with an alternative of Allah’s decision. These and such persons are they whom Allah has declined to cleanse their hearts and minds from moral and spiritual defilement. They must expect disgrace and humiliation here below, and unremitting punishment hereafter
Attentive hearers to falsehood as they are, they are also hungry for ill-gotten gain and for eating people out of their property. Should they come to you seeking your judgement on certain points in dispute or on two notions whether or not they can be reconciled, then you may accept to judge between them or you may decline if you prefer. If you decline, they shall not touch you and you shall be out of harm's way. But should you accept sitting in judgement, then judge between them in equity, for Allah likes those who recourse to general principles of justice
But is it not incredible that they should come to you for judgement when they have AL-Tawrah where Allah has laid down His law! Nevertheless, objections will be taken against your decision if it is not consonant with their desire. These are people who are not really a part of the faith
We have sent down AL-Tawrah with emphasis on the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and to bring intellectual illumination and enlightenment. We made it the standard of judgement and the canon law by which the Prophets, who conformed to Islam, would administer righteousness and justice between the Jews. And so would the rabbins and the canonists who were entrusted with it as the guide Book where Providence is the guide and were witnesses to its divinity. Therefore, do not fear the people but fear me. Nor should you exchange the truth of my revelations and of -the mission of My Messenger- for the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. And remember that he, who does not judge matters according to the rules revealed by Allah, will have denied Allah. Such persons are indeed infidels
And We decreed in AL-Tawrah a prescriptive rule for them to observe, Thus: "The life repays for the life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth and the wounds are subject to retaliation ",But he who remits the return of like for like as a charitable contribution, shall find that this act of kindness has served to expiate some of his sins. And those who do not judge matters, according to the law revealed by Allah shall be wrongful of actions
Then sent ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, to succeed the Jewish Prophets to corroborate faith in AL-Tawrah set before him and We graced him with AL-Injil guiding to all truth and imparting intellectual illumination and enlightenment, confirming the statutes set forth in AL-Tawrah and serving as the spirit of truth that guides to all truth and as an admonition to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
Just as it was mandatory that the Jews would use AL-Tawrah as the standard of judgement, so would the Christians; they were commanded to use AL-Injil as the canon law by which to judge matters. He who does not use the standard of judgement as revealed by Allah, shall be wrongful of actions, and such persons are the wicked
And We have sent down to you O Muhammad the Quran confirming the Scriptures revealed before it -AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil- and serving as the Book of reference for matters disputed among Ahl AL-Kitab, for it is the umpire of all preceding Scriptures, and the decision based on its precepts shall have to be, accepted as final. Therefore, base your Judgments Muhammad on its precepts revealed by Allah, and do not follow their desires which deviate from the truth imparted to you. In fact, for each of you people Jews, Christians and Muslims have We authoritatively determined a law and a course to follow, and had Allah willed, He would have made all of you one conjoint body united in feeling and thought. But He meant to test your qualities with what He has ordained for-you. Therefore, contend you people for good will and for deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety; you are all destined to go back to Allah, and there and then shall He inform you of the detailed particulars of all the points upon which the whole unreasoning turned
And judge O Muhammad between them in a manner consistent with the precepts revealed by Allah. And do not act upon their desires and beware of them lest they seduce you into a course of action not totally divine. And should they turn a deaf ear, then you must realize that Allah has purposed to requite them in return for some of their iniquities; and many of the people are indeed wicked
Is it the folly reign of paganism that they wish to institute! But who is a better judge than Allah to pass an equitable judgement upon people who lift to Him their inward sight
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Do not take the Jews and the Christians -when warring against you- as intimate friends nor favour their tutelage; they both act in concert to set themselves as your antagonists, and their ill-will unites their thoughts. And he who favours their tutelage shall be counted as one of them; Allah does not guide the wrongful to His path of righteousness
And you see those hypocrites whose ill-natured hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being, hasten on to win their tutelage and they interpret their thoughts in words, Thus: "We fear," they say, "lest one day fortune be on their side and we should be overcome and suffer at their hands". May Allah make victory sit on your helm O Muslims or take matters of fact and circumstance them after His own manner; there and then shall the hypocrites be really sorry and pained at heart for having succumbed to their evil thoughts
And there and then shall say those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand to Ahl AL-Kitab: "Are these -the hypocrites- not the people who swore fealty to you". Now have their hopes been doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness; they have come to be great losers
O you who have conformed to Islam : He who turns renegade and deserts Islam in favour of another religion shall not frustrate the laws nor the statutes of heaven's realm; Allah shall replace them by people whom He favours and who lift to Him their inward sight; they are humble and meek with their co - religionists and proud - hearted hauty severe toward the infidels; they strive in the cause of Allah not caring what people say. This is the grace of Allah; He confers it on whom He will, and Allah is Wasiun (Omnipresent),and 'Alimun
Indeed the only tutelary guardian you have O Muslims is Allah and the only tutelary friends you have are His Messenger and those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand, who engage in the act of worship, give Zakat and kneel to Allah in adoration
And he who chooses to be under Allah’s, tutelage and takes His Messenger and those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand as his tutelary friends shall find that Allah’s party attains the desired end
O You who have conformed to Islam: Do not take defenders, supporters, or intimate friends from among those given the Book before you, nor from the infidels who are at enmity with your faith. It is incumbent on you to deny their tutelage. They mock your religion and amuse themselves with its principles. You just entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
And when you call to prayer, they mockingly mimic and deride the act of worship and amuse themselves with what they hear and see. This is because they are a people who lack the faculty of comprehending intellectually
Ask them O Muhammad: you Ahl AL-Kitab, do you have this vindictive disposition against us only because we believe in Allah and in the Quran revealed to us and in the Scriptures revealed aforetime! "The fact is that most of you are wicked
Say to them: "Shall I inform you of what is worse: you stir yourselves against your kind, and worse against yourselves, and far worse is that you have come within the measure of Allah’s wrath". Accordingly, Allah had decreed they be monkyfied and vested with swinish disposition and their monkey and swine-like character and behaviour be viewed with contempt and they be despised and rejected of men and be worshippers of idols. These and such persons have indeed assumed the worst position in society here and Hereafter and strayed far away from the path of righteousness
When they pay you a visit, be it sociable or in other manner, they declare they have conformed to Islam, when in fact they have come in with minds captivated by infidelity and hostile intentions and come out with the same attributes, and Allah is 'Alimun of what they concealed of private thoughts and feelings
And you see many of them hasten on to commit themselves to an evil line of conduct and to transgression, not to mention their hunger for ill-gotten gain. Evil indeed is what their minds habituated them to do
Is it not utterly incredible that their rabbins, and canonists do not forbid their tongues from uttering ill nor do they admonish them to fear their ill-gotten gain!: "Evil indeed is their habitual course of action applying to their deeds consequent on volition
The Jews insolently say: "Allah keeps His hands tightly shut; He is close - fisted". Close-fisted be their hands and cursed they are for their evil thoughts expressed in words, but He is open-handed; He yields abundantly as He will and how He will. And the more Allah bestows on you O Muhammad of His bounty, the more do many of them err for infirmity of purpose, and display their transgressive infirmities of themselves and sink deeper in infidelity under the vexations of their minds. And We stirred up enmity and hatred among them -the Christians among themselves and between the Christians and the Jews till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they inflame passion for kindling a war against you Muhammad, Allah extinguishes their reason and their alacrity. They strive to spread mischief and create discord on earth, and Allah detests those characterized with prepensed malice
Had Ahl al-Kitab conformed to Allah’s will and acknowledged the mission of His Messenger and -the Quran- sent down to him, and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, We would have dropped the charges against them and cancelled their misfortunes and admitted them to the gardens of bliss and beatitude
And had they adhered to the precepts of AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil and complied with all that was revealed to them from Allah, their Creator, He would have made all grace abound in them, spiritually from the realm above them and materially from the earth beneath their feet. Among them are a people who lift to Allah their inward sight and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety, but many of them are wrongful of actions; evil indeed is what they do
O you the Messenger: Proclaim and intimate all that has been revealed to you from Allah, your Creator, and if you do not, then you Will have not proclaimed His message. Under His tutelage, Allah protects you from the people who are characterized by acts of prepensed malice and hostile intentions. Indeed Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness those who are. Given to infidelity
Say to them: O you Ahl AL-Kitab, you bend on a system of faith not standing upon the vantage ground of truth until you comply with the precepts of AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil and all that has been sent down to you from Allah, your Creator. But the more Allah bestows on you O Muhammad of His bounty, the more do many of them err for infirmity of purpose and display their transgressive infirmities of themselves and sink deeper in infidelity under the vexations of their minds. Therefore, do not grieve over those who are infidels indeed
Nonetheless, those who believe in- the prophets who dated for back in the past and those who profess Judaism and the various sects of the Sabeites and of the Sabaeans and the Christians and those who fall in line with the prophet Muhammad; whoever believes in Allah, and acknowledges the truth of Resurrection and Judgement and imprints his deeds with wisdom and piety, shall Heaven reward them for their homage thereto, and no fear nor dread shall fall upon them nor shall they come to grief
For once We entered into a covenant with Bani Isra‘il and We sent to them Messengers. Yet as often as a Messenger was sent to them with divine principles not to their taste, some they renounced and accused of assuming false character and others they killed or conspired for their death
They overlooked Allah’s test of their belief and mental leaning, and closed their hearts’ ears and their minds’ eyes and deviated from the path of righteousness. Yet Allah gave up resentment against them and pardoned their offense. Again, many of them closed their hearts’ ears and their minds’ eyes; Allah is Bassirun (Omnipresent); He sees all that they do
Infidels indeed are those who declare Allah is the Messiah, ‘Isa, the son of Maryam. And ‘Isa said to them: "O you Bani Isra‘il, worship Allah, my Creator and your Creator and he who incorporates with Him other deities shall be denied Paradise; Allah shall exclude him totally from the eternal bliss and shall destine him to the abode in Hell. And those who are wrongful shall have no tutelary protectors to afford them help Hereafter
Again, infidels indeed are those who say: "Allah in Trinity; Allah is One and Only, the Absolute, and the Creator of the universe. If they do not desist their foolish thoughts and correct their derangement of mind, those of them who continue to pursue this line of thought are infidels indeed and the infidels must expect a painful doom
Is it not time to change their state of mind and in lowliest plight stand repentant to Allah and invoke His forgiveness! Then they shall find Allah Ghafurun and Rahimun
Indeed, the Messiah, the son of Maryam, was no more than a Messenger; many Messengers like him have passed away before him. His mother was a woman vested with saintliness of life and character; she and her son consumed food. See how We expound to them Our revelations, yet you see how they counsel deaf
Say to them O Muhammad: Do you worship besides Allah those who -can neither do you harm nor afford you help, when Allah is He Who controls your fate and He is Sami'un (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition, and 'Alimun
Say to them: O you Ahl AL-Kitab, Do not carry your religious beliefs to excess and beyond the truth, nor follow the same inordinate desires propounded by a people who erred and went wrong in Judgement aforetime* and caused many to go wrong. They wandered from the path of righteousness
Maledictions were poured upon those of them who rejected faith among Bani Isra‘il by the words uttered against them with the tongues of Dawud (David) and ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, on account of their disobedience, willful transgression and violation of Allah’s commands
They never exhorted each other to laudable conduct but they shut their eyes to iniquities and abuses. Evil indeed is what they perpetrated of atrocities and wrong deeds
You see many of them ally themselves to the infidels who disbelieved in Allah. Evil indeed is what their inherent dominating power has determined for them that it made Allah deny them mercy on their souls and destine them to eternal suffering Hereafter
If they were indeed faithful to Allah and to the Prophet Muhammad and gave credence to the Quran sent to him, they would not have sought the infidels’ tutelage, but many of them are indeed wicked
You shall find O Muhammad the most avowed enemy to those who conformed their will to Allah’s will arc the Jews and those who incorporate with Allah other deities. And you shall find that the people who have a better disposition toward those who conformed their will to Allah’s will are those who are Christians. This is because among them, there are priests and monks who fear Allah and not extravagant in their accounts of themselves nor do they entertain inordinate self-esteem
When they listen to the Quran and to a discourse of practical divinity sent down to the Messenger they are excited to tears which you see overflowing from their eyes at the truth they recognize and they interpret their thoughts in words characterized by an invocatory prayer, thus: "O Allah, our Creator", they say, "we have recognized the truth and our hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues; Our Creator, incorporate us with those who bear witness to the truth and to the glory of Your system of faith and worship
And why do we not recognize Allah", they add, "with all our hearts and give credence, to the truth we have received, when we hope that Allah would incorporate us with those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
In response Allah graced them with a distinguished reward. They shall be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity. This is the reward befitting the ones whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
Whereas those who rejected faith and denied Allah and His ordinances and refused to recognize His revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority, shall be the inmates of Hell wherein they shall have passed through nature to eternal suffering
O you who have conformed to Islam: Do not forbid the worthy and wholesome victuals Allah rendered lawful for you to eat, nor carry your concepts of the religion to excess and pass beyond due bounds; Allah does not like those who go beyond the limits prescribed
Eat of what We provisioned you; it is all replete with choice of all delights and enjoy all that is pure, lawful, wholesome and not forbidden, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah Whom you maintain as the heart of your purpose
Allah excuses you for oaths in which the guilt does not reside in the intention, but He holds you responsible for the oaths in which guilt resides in the intention, an affront nothing can expiate but
O you who have conformed to Islam You had better realize in fact, that
The fact is that AL-Shaytan and those with characteristics befitting him wish to use intoxicants and gambling as the instrument to implant enmity and hatred among you and to alienate you from keeping Allah in mind and from the act of worship. And if he succeeds to sow the wind you will have reaped the whirlwind. Therefore, are you not going to discontinue this line of evil conduct
You had better obey Allah and obey His Messenger and beware not to come within the measure of Allah’s wrath. And should you counsel deaf, then you must realize that Our Messenger is responsible only for conveying Our clear message
No guilt incurred on those who have conformed to Islam and cultivated their deeds with piety, relative to the kind of food they might have consumed in the past, provided
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Allah shall test you while on pilgrimage; He shall tempt you with game within easy reach of your hands and your lances to distinguish those who will direct their thoughts to Allah and revere Him, albeit they cannot apprehend Him by sight. And he who transgresses henceforth shall be put to the torture
O you whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues: Do not kill game while vested with the pilgrim’s garb, during major or minor pilgrimage, and he who intentionally kills such an animal shall pay the equivalent thereto from animals reared for food. The exact equivalent be it in kind or in value, shall be judged by two of your men known to recourse to general principles of justice. And the sacrifice will be an offering to the Ka’ba. Failing this then he may supply food to the indigent in the amount equivalent to the price determined. Or he may fulfill his obligation by fasting -from dawn to sunset for a day or more as determined by the judges so that he tastes the evil consequences of his guilt. Bygone shall be bygone; Allah forgives what is past. And he who falls back into the same wrong-doing shall be severely punished; Allah shall take just vengeance on him; Allah is Qadirun, He justly avenges His right
Fishing and hunting water game from salt and fresh waters have been rendered lawful for you, and the flesh of the catch is lawful for you and for the travelers to eat. Whereas forbidden unto you are the pursuit of land game so long as you are vested with the pilgrim's garb. And entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah to Whom you shall be thronged
Allah has made the Ka’ba, the Sacrosanct House, the Macca of mankind and the aspiration of one’s life to visit for material and spiritual reformation. He established the Sacred Month -of pilgrimage- the offerings and the garlands mantling them in order to realize that Allah knows fully well all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth and that Allah is 'Alimun indeed
Bring vividly, you people, before your minds and let it be realized in fact that Allah’s punishment is very painful, and that He is also Ghafurun and Rahimun
And let it be remembered that Our Messenger is entrusted only with relating the divine revelations and Allah is 'Alimun of all you reveal and of all you conceal
Say to them O Muhammad: "It is quite evident that bad and good do not together accord, nor can you compare an object with evil savour with an object emblematic of goodness, albeit the abundance of the former may excite your admiration. Therefore, entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah you people who reflect; you may hopefully prosper
O you who have conformed to Islam: Do not ask about matters not apprehensible, matters, which if made known would disturb you. If you call upon the Messenger for information after having been inspired with the relevant revelations, you will be offered the explanation. Allah has forgiven you for these questions incidental to these matters, and Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
Some of those who preceded you had peered inquisitively into such matters and asked all sorts of questions, and when the nature of such matters was overtly declared, they simply lost faith; they dismissed the idea and were no longer loving subjects but disobedient rebels
Allah never authorized you to proclaim unlawful what He has rendered lawful. Never did Allah impose the dedication of certain animals under any form of superstitions. Thus, you profanely relieve from service, designate by a descriptive name and dedicate to idols
When told to recourse to what Allah has sent down of divine revelations, and to the Messenger for help and advice, they simply refuse. They say: "We are quite satisfied with the particular system of faith and worship our fathers were bent on. But how will it be if their fathers had lacked the soundness of judgement and had missed the path of righteousness
Begin with yourselves and invest your own souls with such religious and spiritual virtues as Allah has inclined you to propound and guard yourselves from being supposed, then no one who deviates in mind can possibly pervert you nor alienate you from Allah’s purpose, provided you lift to Him your inward sight and maintain His path of righteousness where Providence is the guide. You are all destined to go back to Allah Who shall inform you of all that your minds and your souls had impelled you to do
O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: when any of you feels death impending and he wishes to make a bequest, then witness action is mandatory. Two of your just men known to recourse to justice are summoned to witness the action. And in the event of being on a journey when the calamity of death befalls you, then two other men are duly detained following the funerary prayer to establish the point in question. And if you should apprehend guilt or fault on their part, then they are asked to perform the act of worship and then be sworn, thus: "We swear by Allah that we have no selfish motive principles nor do we favour anyone for a gain, even if he be within the first degree of consanguinity, nor will we hide or suppress testimony a divine duty, and be wrongful of actions
However, if it is found out, that they have willfully uttered false evidence while on oath, they are replaced by others who claim lawful right to the deceased estate. They are sworn that their evidence is more consistent with fact than that given by the other two men, "whom", they say, "we do not falsely accuse of perjury nor do we give false evidence lest we would be wrongful of actions
This prudent course of action is less likely to make the witnesses depart from moral righteousness; it will induce them to honesty lest their testimony be rejected and be replaced by others. Therefore, keep you people Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him; Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness those who are given to evil
One day shall Allah gather the Messengers and ask them, thus: "What response did you get from the people to whom you were sent and how did it accord with their deeds!" And they shall say: "Glory be to You, but You are the Omniscient of all the unknown and of all the invisible and of all private thoughts and feelings
Then shall Allah address ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, thus: "Do you remember O ‘Isa My divine favour and the efficacious grace I conferred on you and on your mother; how I supported you and gave you countenance by the Holy Spirit Jibril that you spoke to people while in the cradle and in manhood. And I taught you the Book and wisdom, AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil and made you present your people with an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace featured in the power I imparted to you to create from clay the figure of a bird and inspirit it and it came to be a living bird by My command and made you restore the sight of the congenitally blind and heal the leper by My command, and with My delegated authority raise the dead by My command. And do you remember how I held back Bani Isra‘il from their intended hostile course of action against you when you presented them with divine clear and plain revelations and signs guiding out of darkness and superstitions of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into intellectual illumination and enlightenment, but the infidels among them said: This is nothing but sheer sorcery assumed by him
And do you remember how I inspired thought and feelings into the disciples and actuated them with the feeling of conforming their will to My will and of acknowledging your Prophethood and how they responded favourably and said: We do conform our will to Allah’s will and said to you: bear witness O ‘Isa that we are now Muslims and we conform to Allah’s system of faith and worship
Then they said to you: "O ‘Isa, the son of Maryam can Allah your Creator, send down from heaven a table" And you said to them: "Revere Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
And they said to you: "We wish to sit at it and eat of the food served to satisfy our reason and rest assured that you have brought us the truth and be witnesses thereof
There and then you made your invocatory prayer, thus "O Allah, our Creator, I pray and beseech you to send down to us from your heaven’s realm a table set with food to serve as an occasion to yield our souls to festive mirth and to regale the first and the last of us who conform their will to Your will and as a graceful sign convincing people of Your Omnipotence and Authority. O Allah, our Creator, and provision us from your bounty with the means of sustaining life; You are the best purveyor to fit every person with what is necessary and with what he needs
Allah said: "I will send it down to you, but then he whose heart, thereafter, dare rise defiant against Allah and denies the truth, will I send to his account with all his sins and imperfections on his head to suffer the endless agony which doubles his torment and his woe to an extent which no one else in the universe will suffer
Then Allah says to ‘Isa: "Did you O ‘Isa, the son of Maryam, ask the people to take you and your mother as two Ilah’s besides Allah and pay you the same tribute that is dutiful only to Allah!" "Glory be to You", says ‘Isa, and extolled are Your glorious attributes how could I have said what was never within my right and infinitely beyond my jurisdiction!" "If I had uttered it or even thought of it, You would have known it, You can read my thoughts whereas I cannot possibly read Yours; You are 'Alimun of the unknown and of the invisible and of all private thoughts and feelings
I never said to them, says ‘Isa, but what You had commanded me to say, thus: "Worship Allah, my Creator and your Creator". "And I observed their deeds and bore witness to their behaviour as long as I lived among them, and when you ordained that I depart life, You were the only one Who constantly kept a vigilant eye upon them and their deeds and toward themselves and toward others and witnessed their course of action You are Shahidun (witness) of all things in all respects
If you punish them and cause them to suffer for their offences, they are Your servants, and if You forgive them You are indeed, AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim (Wise)
There and then says Allah "This is the Day when truth shall advantage the virtuous, and truthfulness is their attribute. There awaits them a blissful life in gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, Allah well pleased with them and they with Him. This is indeed triumph supreme
To Allah belong the sovereignty and the supreme controlling power of the heavens and the earth- and of all that they comprise. and He is indeed Qadirun over all things
Praise is to Allah Who created the heavens and the earth and introduced darkness and light- both physical and spiritual-. Yet the infidels equalize Him with creatures of their fancy and incorporate them with Him as a corporate deity
You people had better realize, that it was He who brought you into being and effected your special creation from clay, then ordained He your span and the span of the universe and kept to Himself the knowledge of the point of time when all shall come to an end, and the Hereafter, begins, Yet you see O Muhammad how they contend with opposing arguments about Resurrection
And He is Allah in the heavens and on earth, Who alone has the rightful claim to reverence and veneration featured in the act of worship and in displaying the appropriate acts and rites. He is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all that you converse secretly or whisper under your breath and of what you suggest, secretly to the mind, of all that your breasts store of thoughts and feelings and of all that you utter. Furthermore, He is 'Alimun of all that you earn of qualities, actions and deeds
Yet no revelation, sign or event betokening Allah's Omnipotence and authority and evinces both His Oneness and exclusive power to control fate and destiny, but they refuse to pay heed to it and they turn a deaf ear
They rejected the truth and counselled deaf to the Quran when it was presented to them to guide them into all truth. But soon shall they realize the truth of all that has been discoursed in this Quran which they hold up to ridicule
Did they not perceive by sight, apprehend by thought and learn by reading how many generations have We destroyed! generations who came to this world before them, endowed with power and ability, diligence and' capacities of action, wealth and knowledge, mental receiving power and talent and with many qualities which total up to a much higher degree than those summed up in you people. We poured down upon them rain and blessings bringing them into a people of condition and We made the rivers run beneath their settled habitations. But in consequence of their ingratitude and inordinate self -esteem, We destroyed them in requital of their transgression of the divine law, their offences against Allah and their violation of the religious and moral principles. We replaced them by other people who listened to reason and whose prudence got the better of their pride
And if We sent down to you O Muhammad a written discourse in sheets of paper fastened together, forming a material whole and they perceived it by sight and felt it by touch; thus still the infidels would have labelled it Sheer magic
They insolently say: If only an angel had been sent down to companion him - Muhammad- to confer on him dignity in an order of Prophethood! But if We had sent down an angel, then their Hereafter would have been planted in the now and their punishment would not have been put in respite
And if We had sent an angel as a Messenger or to companion Our human Messenger, We would have disguised him as a man, and there one disorder would be aggravated by another; they would not believe in him either, and a fallacious mode of reasoning would be created more than ever; they would not know whether to use the premise to prove the conclusion or to use the conclusion to prove the premise - a vicious circle
None the less, Messengers who were sent before you O Muhammad were also bombarded with foul epithets. The infidels mocked them and gave them a lick with the rough side of their tongues and called them everything they could lay their tongues to. In consequence were the mockers beset on all sides by the same material and immaterial things they turned into ridicule
Say to them: "Journey the land and open your mind’s eyes to see for yourselves the fatal consequence which united all those who persisted in their intentional assertion of falsehood
Ask them: "To whom do you think the universe belongs!" and say to them: "Rest assured that all things including the earth and the Heavens and all that is in them, constituting a systematic whole, belong to Allah alone, Who ascribed mercy unto Himself to give people a chance to repent before the undoubted Day of Resurrection when He shall gather you all to His August Presence. There and then shall the infidels who denied Him realize that they were born to be great losers
And to Him belong all created beings whose activity is suspended during the darkness of the night as well as all created beings whose activity is suspended during day light and He is AL-Sami' with unlimited audition and AL-'Alim
Say to them: "Would I choose to be under the tutelage of any besides Allah Who has generated the heavens and the earth! He provisions all with the requisites of life while He is provisioned by no one nor is He contingent on, nor conditioned by, the material or the immaterial". Say to them: "I have been commanded to be the first who conforms to Islam and never to be one of those who incorporate with Him other deities
Say to them: "I am fearful to offend Allah, my Creator. If I were to disobey Him, Heaven shall lay my transgression to my charge and requite me with an immense punishment on a momentous Day
He who escapes censure on that Momentous Day, will have won Allah's mercy, and this is indeed triumph supreme
If Allah afflicts you with a touch of a misfortune then no one can relieve you of it but Him. And if He should grace you with a touch of good fortune, He is Qadirun to effect all in all
He is the Supreme controlling and influencing power inherent in all His servants and in His Created beings, and He is the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations and AL-Khabir (Cognizant of all things)
Ask O Muhammad those who doubt your mission: "What documentary evidence has more weight to support the truth of my mission than the attestation by Allah Himself!" "He is the witness of my actions and of your actions". "This Quran has been inspired to me to guide you into all truth and to warn you and warn all those whom it shall reach against counting Allah as being plural". "Do you people really bear witness to the plurality of Allah!" "I Just will not accord with this". Say to them: "Indeed He is only One Ilah, and I am absolutely innocent of your ills, and above all of your notion of incorporating with Him other deities
Those who were recipients of Our Word -Jews and Christians- to whom We gave the Book -AL-Tawrah and AL-Injil (Torah and Bible) do recognize this Book -the Quran- as well as the Messenger to whom it is sent. They assert the existence of this reality as much as they are able to assert the identity of their sons, but those who are cheaply vicious to the perdition of their own souls refuse to recognize the truth
And who is more wrongful than he who viciously and wrongfully relates to Allah falsehood or denies His revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority! Never shall the wrongful of actions find one instance of physical or spiritual prosperity Hereafter
The Day shall come when We throng them all together and say to them: "Where are your deities which you presumed to have divine nature that you incorporated them with Allah
Not knowing what to do nor which way to turn they shall say: "By Allah, our Creator, never did we incorporate with Allah other deities
See how they will lie in their teeth and tell lies about themselves and be forsaken and renounced by those whom they presumed to share with Allah His divine nature and how they shall fail their expectations
And among them are some who listen to your discourse on practical divinity and to the Quran when you recite it, not to profit by it but to pick holes in it and be able to tell their evil minds. The fact is that We have closed their hearts’ ears and deafened their ears to reason. They just would not apprehend with their senses any revelation or any sign no matter how convincing to the mind they be. And when they come to you O Muhammad they do not humble themselves but in arrogance they are more ready to argue than to obey. Vested with infidelity, they interpret their thoughts in words: "This is nothing", they say, "but fables of old
And they incite people to reject the Quran and decline to accept it, and they themselves have nothing to do with it. They only bring irretrievable disaster upon themselves and they do not have the wisdom to perceive this fact
If only you could visualize their change of mind when they are confined into the slavish imprisonment of Hell! They shall wish they could be sent back to life below and they would never deny Allah's revelations and signs, and they would be among those who conform to Allah's will
The fact is that now they do realize their earlier sinful settled behaviour, representing their hidden common feeling of the denial of the truth. And if they were sent back to life below, they would, thus still, resume the same evil practice they were advised to avoid; they are indeed liars
They fail to recall to mind what they perpetuated of thoughts which they expressed in words, thus: "There is only this present life" they say, "and it, is only time that shall do away with it, and never shall we be resurrected
And if you could visualize them when they are in the August presence in audience of Allah, their Creator, and He asks them: "Is this not the graphic description of the truth which was related to you by our Messenger you simply denied! "By Allah, our Creator, it is", they say, there and then they shall be told: "Taste the torment laid upon the damned for your intentional denial of the truth
Losers indeed are those who deny Resurrection and their audience of Allah, their Creator. And when all of a sudden the predetermined Eventful Hour surprises them, they shall say with pining regrets and vain repentances: "It is a great pity to have neglected our duty to Allah in life below and for what we left undone." They shall be burdened with wrongs more then their backs can bear. Evil indeed is the fate of those who are burdened with wrongs, and evil indeed are the wrongs they wear
Indeed life here is but an illusive and rapid change of feeling, fancy and thought and an amusement bringing happiness to those who cannot think, whereas, the abode in heaven's realm Hereafter is far better and indeed blissful but for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; can you people not reflect
We do know O Muhammad that what their dishonesty admits of irreverent discourse grieves you at heart, In fact it is not you that they charge with falsehood, but it is Allah's revelations, signs and Authority that the wrongful deny. They befool their minds and their judgement of the truth to cause what is false be accepted as true
Messengers before you O Muhammad had been charged with falsehood just the same and they put up with the charge and bore criticism and wrongful treatment with forbearance, and they bore with their opponents their faults and limitations until Allah ordained to be their very present help ; decisions pronounced by Allah are decisive, irrevocable and conclusive. You have already been given a narrative of the Messengers who preceded you
If their natural aversions and antipathies perturb you, and you are able to excavate a roadway underground or set up a ladder to ascend heavenward to bring about a sign to convince them of the truth of your mission, then by all means do it. Had Allah willed He would have united their thoughts and feelings to meditate reverence and obedience to Him and seek His guidance and spiritual union. Therefore, do not be one of those destitute of Allah's knowledge
It is only those who bow down their ears and open their heats’ ears that favourably respond to heaven's call and to spiritual prompting, whereas those destitute of spiritual life are as good as dead to admonition and the dead shall only hear when Allah resurrects them, be it in this world or in the world to come when back to Him they return
And the infidels say: "If only a convincing divine sign be bestowed on him, a sign we perceive mentally or by sight! Say to them O Muhammad: "Allah is Omnipotent enough to send down any specific sign, but most of them are so ignorant to know the truth
There is not a beast in the animal kingdom on earth nor a bird moving through the air with its wings but form distinct nations like you people. We have not left out anything informative but included it in this Book, and all shall just the same be thronged before Allah, their Creator
Those who denied Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority, and denied your mission O Muhammad are indeed deaf and dumb; they are shrivelled into the darkness of want of spiritual and intellectual sight. But Allah misguides the minds of whom He. Will and guides to His path of righteousness whom He will
Say to them: "What if Allah afflicts you with a penalty in requital of your evil deeds or your Hereafter be planted in the now! Who is there besides Allah to invoke for mercy, if indeed you declare the truth
Indeed it is only Allah Whom you shall inevitably invoke to relieve your misery if He will, and you shall forget your false deities whom you incorporate with Him
We have sent Messengers before you O Muhammad to peoples who came to this world before your people, and We afflicted them with misfortunes and wedded them to calamities hoping they would, humble themselves to Allah
But even then and thus still, they became hard-hearted and were befooled by AL-Shaytan (Satan) who allured them to brighter worlds as a reward for their doings and he led the way
And when they became wilfully unmindful of all that We had imparted to them of knowledge and of the misfortunes they suffered, We opened, for them all the great channels of prosperity until their appetite and desire were gratified and they rejoiced beyond a common joy. There and then We suddenly seized them and dressed them with ruin and there, they simply gave up hope and nursed despair
There, were struck at the root and uprooted from the earth the people who were wrongful of actions. An inducement to people of piety to turn to Allah, Creator of the worlds, with praise and best thanks for purging the world of its corrupt members
Ask them O Muhammad: "What if Allah denies you your faculty of hearing and that of sight, faculties divine, and closes your hearts' ears! Who is that deity who is able to restore them to you!" See Muhammad how We expound and orient Our revelations to circumstances and requirements yet they counsel deaf and refuse to heed
Ask them: "What if Allah 's punishment surprises you or casts its shadow before it strikes you to your marrow! Who but the wrongful of actions shall perish
We only send the Messengers in the capacity of spectacles and warnings, and those who recognize their missions and acknowledge Allah's Authority with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety will have won Allah's mercy; no fear or dread shall fall upon them nor shall they come to grief
But those who refuse to recognize Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority and rejecting the truth of Our Messengers’ missions shall suffer the torment laid on the damned who grew daily more and more wicked
Say to your people O Muhammad: "I do not claim to be in possession of the treasuries of Allah nor do I indulge in prophecy or claim to foretell future events nor do I say I am an angel. I only follow what is inspired to me of truth to guide all people into all truth". And ask them: "Shall they be esteemed alike, those who are lacking in intellectual, moral and spiritual perception, and those who perceive mentally and apprehend the truth by thought! Can you people not employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions
And use the Quran O Muhammad to warn those who are apprehensive of the inevitable occasion when they are thronged before Allah, their Creator, besides Whom they simply have no tutelary protector nor an intercessor, they may, hopefully entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
And do not oblige the rich infidels who suffer from inordinate self-esteem, by dismissing those who are humble in rank or station before they listen to your discourse on Islam. Poor as they are, they uplift their hands and their inward sight to Allah in their devotional exercise morning and evening seeking only the illumination proceeding from Him, featured in the language spoken by His countenance. You are not accountable O Muhammad to Allah for their deeds or actions, nor are they accountable to Allah for your deeds or actions to induce you to dismiss them and be wrongful of action
Thus did We take matters of fact as they were and circumstanced them after Our own manner. We gathered the rich and the poor together to try them and expose the inclination of the one in the presence of the other. And there contemptuously, said the rich who were extravagant in their accounts of themselves: "Is it these whom Allah has graced among us!" Does Allah not know best the thankful who are actuated with the feeling of gratitude
And when those who opened their hearts’ ears and their minds’ eyes to Our revelations and signs come to you O Muhammad, address them with the expression of good will and courtesy "peace be upon you" and proclaim to them what will please them to hear, thus: " Allah ascribed mercy unto Himself as an attribute to Him to the end that he who commits himself among you to an evil line of conduct in ignorance and in lowliest plight stands repentant thereafter and henceforth imprints his deeds with wisdom and piety shall find Allah Ghafurun and` Rahimun
Thus do We expound Our revelations and render Our discourse readily understood so as not to confound the course of action followed by the pious with that on which the wicked are resolved, and there shall the worker from the work distinct be known
Say to them O Muhammad: "I have been forbidden to worship those deities whom you invoke in prayer or appeal to for aid and protection besides Allah. " And say to them: "Should I be tempted to follow your wishes or act upon your desires, then I will have missed the path of righteousness and failed to be one of those who have the world all before them and Providence their guide
Say to them O Muhammad: "I follow the law I received from Allah, the law illuminating the eyes and imparting spiritual and intellectual enlightenment -the Quran- which you have totally denied". "I do not have control over Allah's punishment which you challenge and impertinently urge that it be hastened on." Decisions lay in the hands of Allah; He declares the truth and He is infinitely the best of all who can decide a question, a matter of doubt or discussion and settle a dispute
Say to them: "If the punishment you have challenged to be hastened on rested on my hands, your Hereafter would have been planted thereupon and the case as put by both of us would have been decided." " Allah knows best the wrongful of actions
And with Him are kept the keys serving to open up, disclose and explain the unknown, the mysterious and the obscure which no one knows but Him. He has omniscience of all that is on the land and in the sea, and not one single leaf, large or small, laterally produced from a stem or a branch, or springing from its root that falls, but comes to His knowledge. Nor a seed embedded in the darkness of the interior of the earth nor anything fresh, or moist, green or dry, withered or solid, but is inscribed and made manifest in a Book
And He is it Who disembodies your souls at night during sleep and knows fully well all that you have done by day when He actuates you; a process continuing up to a predetermined point of time, then back to Him shall you return when He informs you of all that your minds and your souls had impelled you to do
He is the Supreme controlling and influencing power inherent in His servants and in all His creatures, and He sends down guardian angels who keep you in sight and commit to writing all your actions and the thoughts running before them until it is time for any of you to encounter death as predetermined by Allah, then Our Messengers disembody his soul and never are they negligent
There and then they are sent back to Allah, their Creator, Who is "Truth personified. " Is the right to Judgement not asserted as Allah's own! He is uniquely swift in putting the law in execution
Ask them O Muhammad "Who saves you from the darkness of deepest dismay when you are unable to cope with a dangerous situation on land or at sea!" "You invoke Him with bated breath and whispering humbleness and in secret that if He extended His mercy to you and saved you, you would be impelled to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
And say to them: "Allah is He who saves you from this dangerous situation and from endless occasions of faintness of the heart from terror, yet and thus still you incorporate with Him other deities
Say to them: "He is the Omnipotent Who is able to drive against you a retributive punishment from the realm above you or from beneath your feet, or to fan the flow of discord among you and split you into adversative factions and make some of you iniquitous and oppressive to the others and make some of you taste the hostilities launched out by others". See O Muhammad how We expound and orient Our revelations to circumstances and requirements that they may hopefully reflect
Yet your people, thus still, deny the Quran, the truth guiding into all truth and deny themselves the knowledge, the wisdom and the spiritual light! Say to them: "I am not entrusted to your care nor am I responsible for your ordinary pursuits of life
To every announcement or a proclamation embodied in the Quran there is a fixed point of time, place and incidence; the inception and duration as well as the completion are predetermined. And then you people shall know of it when it comes to pass
And when you see those critical of Our revelations holding a, fault - finding and censorious, discourse on the subject, you just avoid them and do not keep company with them until they have changed the subject and virtue and wisdom no longer sit in want. Should Al-Shaytan make you forget, then collect your spirits, thoughts and mind and sit no longer with the wrongful of actions
Those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah are in no way accountable to Allah for the deeds or actions of the wrongful However they should put them in mind of the truth hoping to bring them to their senses and. Induce them to entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
And dismiss O Muhammad from your thoughts those who do not justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will and treat it mockingly and amuse themselves with its principles pinning it ostentatiously to their sleeves. They are deceived by the sensuous enjoyment they regarded as the chief object of life. But put them in mind of the truth, it may hopefully bring them to their senses and they come to realize that every soul shall be requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and shall have no tutelary protector besides Allah. Nor shall humble intercession be accepted from any on behalf of another, nor shall the equivalent in ransom pay for the expiation of the guilt of the one or the other. These persons of common attributes, qualities and actions shall be requited with what is commensurate with their deeds. Their uneasy and painful sensation of thirst shall only be quenched with boiling water and they shall suffer the torment laid on the damned who grew daily more and more wicked, intentionally denying the truth and asserting falsehood
Say to them O Muhammad: "Is it befitting to invoke besides Allah mortals, immortals or figures made of stone or wood, when none of them can afford us help nor is it in their capacity to do us harm, and we be so ignorant to depreciate the spirit of truth guiding into all truth!" And is it wise to turn on our heels and reverse our natural instinct which manifests itself in rational acts after we have received divine enlightenment and illumination and the world is all before us and Providence our guide! "If so, we would stand similitude exact of someone who has been befooled by the Satanic, who wanders over the earth without rest perplexed in its enormous extent, not directed by reason or a fixed purpose, and in quest, he knows not of what, unknowing where his course is bound! "Influenced by the Satanic, he hardly hears the call of his good and pious friends begging him to come back to them and urge peace with Allah and reconcile himself with his own heart and with Allah". Say to them; "it is, only the course steered by Allah that leads to the path of righteousness where Providence is the guide and we Muslims have been commanded to conform our will to Allah’s will
And we have been commanded to engage in the act of worship and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, for to Him We shall all be thronged
He is it Who created the heavens and the earth in truth and with a set of invariable cosmic laws in all manner of wisdom and for a valid reason. The instant He says to an object or to an event "Be" it is there. His Word is the truth personified and to Him belong the absolute sovereignty and the full control of the Eventful Event when the trumpet is sounded indicative of Resurrection and Judgement. He is the Omniscient of the invisible, the hidden and the unseen, the Omniscient of what the breasts store of thoughts and feelings and of what they forge. He has cognizance and holds prescience of what you converse secretly and utter below your breath and of what is suggested secretly to the mind. He is well acquainted with the visible and the seen and with what is avowed openly and openly disclosed, with all that is uttered loudly and with all that is being said. He is Al Hakim (he Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations) and AL-Khabir (The Omniscient)
For once did Ibrahim ask his father Azar (Athar) "Do you take figures made of stone and/or wood as godheads? O my father, I do see you and your people lost in the maze of error
Thus, did We carry Ibrahim beyond the physical world to show him the wonders and spiritual glories behind the magnificent powers and laws of the physical universe to affirm his inward sight and his deep thoughts with certainty
When the night darkened the world around him, he saw, with his inward sight a heavenly body glittering in the vault of heaven. This, said he, "is my Allah." But when it set he said: "I just do not like things that set, and cease to be
Then when he saw the moon, again with his inward sight, rising into view and over head it sat: "This is my Allah", he said. But again when it vanished from sight he said: "Unless the supreme controlling and influencing power actuates me with thought and guidance, I will certainly be lost in a maze
When he saw the sun rising, he acknowledged it his Allah; "It is greater ", he said. But when it set, he opened his mind’s eyes and said: "O my people, I am indeed innocent of all that you incorporate with Allah the Eternal
Now do I turn my face and set my thoughts with firmness in fidelity, allegiance and fulfilment of all duties owed to Him, the Eternal Ilah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, and I am not one of those incorporating with Him other deities
His people contended with him with opposing arguments against the thought of one Allah and warned him of their indignation. But he said to them: "Do you contend with me with opposing arguments against Allah Who has guided me to His path of righteousness!" "I do not regard with fear those deities whom you incorporate with Him nor shall I be in harm's way unless it be Allah's will. Allah, My Creator is Omnipresent, and His Omniscience embraces all in all; can you not reflect
And how should I fear those deities whom you incorporate with Him and you do not fear the consequences and the malignant fate awaiting you in requital of incorporating with Him other deities whom He never authorized! "Which of the two parties, would then be safe and secure if only you knew
Indeed those who believed in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and did not confuse their spiritual apprehension of divine truths with wrongful actions and injustice are they who shall escape censure; they shall be graced with safety and security and the world is all before them and Providence their guide
One judgement was deduced from another; that was the reasoning We imparted to Ibrahim to use against his people's contention. We raise whom We will to higher ranks and exalt them in dignity, wisdom and power. Allah, your Creator, is indeed Hakimun and 'Alimun
We invested him with the privilege of begetting a pious progeny, Ishaq and Ya'qub (Isaac, Jacob) both of whom We guided into all truth just as We had guided Nuh (Noah) aforetime. And of Nuh's posterity We conducted Dawud (David) and Sulayman (Solomon), Ayub (Job) and Yusuf (Joseph), Mussa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron). Thus do We reward those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
And Zakariya (Zachariah) and Yahya (John), ‘Isa (Jesus) and Ilias (Elias), all and each were enrolled among the virtuous
And Isma‘IL (Ishmael) and Ilias, Yunis (Jonah) and Lut (Lot), all and each We favoured by preference out of all mankind
And of their forefathers, posterity and brethren did We choose some whom We guided into all truth and We led the way
This is the true accord of Allah - the union of His will and affections - attuned to the spirit of truth guiding whom He will of His servants into all truth. Had they incorporated with Him other deities they would have been denied the prerogative of Prophethood besides the loss incurred. Their hopes would have been doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness
These were they to whom We entrusted the Book, the spirit of truth guiding people into all truth and ministering to their material and spiritual lives. We graced them with the divinely - given wisdom and sovereignty and with the special prerogative of Prophethood. If these people* - reject these divinely - given advantages, others have been entrusted with them; they fulfilled the requirements and proved worthy of the trust. * Meccans
These are they whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand; they proved to be worthy of Allah's grace and prerogatives. Therefore, take them O Muhammad as a guide, follow their example and espouse their opinions. And say to your people: " I do not charge you a price for imparting to you Allah's revelations or disclosures, wisdom or practical divinity; the Quran - is simply the fountain - head of all truth that puts mankind in mind of reality
And they* did not credit Allah with the attributes asserted as His own; they failed to ponder His marvels crediting His Omnipotence. They said: "Never did Allah disclose divine knowledge to a human being nor did He admit discourse directly or indirectly to His Omnipotence and Authority". Ask them; "Who then had sent down the Book you knew that Mussa presented to his people, the Book flowing forth with illumination and enlightenment to illuminate the intellect of mankind; the Book the Jews divided and again broke up into subdivisions and published the parts they planned to disclose and concealed the many parts which would publish their shame and their immorality; the Book which imparted to them divine knowledge and acquainted them intellectually with facts neither they nor their fathers had ever known". "Is it not Allah!" Let them Muhammad drown themselves in the nonsensical and engage in amusement which is the happiness of those who cannot think. * The Meccan Infidels and the Jews
And this Quran -is Heaven's- sent Book breeding perpetual benediction, corroborating and authoritatively validating the authentic Books revealed aforetime; Use it Muhammad to warn people of the mother City and the people of all cities around. It is a Book highly credited by those who acknowledge the truth of the Hereafter and regularly observe their act of worship
And who is more wrongful than him who relates falsehood to Allah and attributes to Him every falsity that could be devised, or claims that he has been inspired by Allah when in fact nothing whatsoever has been inspired to him! And who is more wicked than him who says: I am able to produce a book the like of that sent down by Allah! If only you Muhammad could see the wicked at the distressful moment of death when they are in agony, of mind and soul, as the angels of death put forward their hands to disembody their souls and say to them: "Now is the moment to surrender your souls "Today you shall suffer the humiliating torment laid upon the damned for attributing to Him nothing but falsehood and for turning your heads in contempt objecting to His signs and revelations with inordinate self-esteem
Now" they are told, "you have come back to Us singly, not less alone than when you were alone when We created you at first and delivered you nude naked and bare to the world below". "Now you have come back to Us stripped of all possessions and of all that We had ascribed to you in life." Nor do We see you accompanied by your intercessors whom you had claimed they enjoyed the same position and power of a god; now the ties of your common fanciful belief are being severed, and those whom you presumed to be godheads have failed your expectation
Allah is indeed the controlling power that influences the seeds and the date-stones to split to take root and to sprout to produce plants and trees; He causes the living to egress from the dead and the dead to fall from the living*; yet how strongly deluded you people are, that you believe a lie
He causes the night to lose its character, and the incipience of the gleam of dawn to cleave its way, and He designated the night as the period of natural repose and recuperation*, and the sun and the moon for determining and computing time. Such is the plan determined by the AL- Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-'Alim
And it is He Who designated the stars as a guide-post for you in your travels amid the darkness of night on land and beyond and at sea. We have expounded and distinctly expressed our revelations to people who reflect
And He is it who brought you into being from one single soul* then He ordained your prototype in the seed** and He made the earth your destined habitation*** where you live a life that deserves the name until the encounter with death when you are deposited in the graves and in due course be reclaimed for Judgement. We have expounded and distinctly expressed Our revelations to people who comprehend the facts
And it is He Who sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain-water and with it do We cause vegetal activity of all -plants-*. And We prompt the green blades to spring up and develop into clusters of ears of grain which ripen and be brought to maturity. And out of the palm trees commanding a view of all that lies around, hang pinnate of fan shaped leaves and sprouting offshoots of variegated and delightful fruits. And of the fruit trees are orchards of grapes, olives and pomegranates besides similar species and -Common characteristics- and dissimilar genus -class or distinct group-. Direct you people your intellectual eye and your inward sight to the fruit trees when they bloom and put forth blossoms and when the flowers come to be fruits which grow ripe, and you shall find enough tokens representing convincing divine evidence symbolic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, giving insight to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
Yet the infidels incorporate with Him the Jinn as partners of Omnipotence and Authority albeit He brought the Jinn into being and caused them to exist. And in ignorance they insolently ascribe to Him sons and daughters; glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes, He is infinitely far beyond all they falsely attribute to Him
He is it who generated the heavens and the earth. How would He have a child when He is infinitely beyond taking a wife! He created all and brought the whole into existence and He is 'Alimun of all in all
This is Allah, your Creator; there is no Ilah but Him, the Creator Who generated all. Therefore, regard Him with reverence and veneration and worship Him alone; He is the Tutelary Guardian of the whole and of all in all
He is not apprehended by sight whereas He comprehends all that is displayed to the bodily eye and all that is brought before the mind’s eye, and He is the Gracious Who gives His servants an understanding heart, and He is AL-Latif (Kind) and Al- Khabir
Say to them O Muhammad: "You people have now received divine evidence engaging the intellect, and enough signs sensed by mental and spiritual vision of those who lift to Allah their inward sight. Therefore, he who exercises his mind’s eyes shall advantage himself, and he who blinds hims elf to the truth shall prejudice his own interests, and you must realize that I am not here to watch over your innocence and folly
Thus much do We explicitly present Our revelations and signs and orient them to circumstances and requirements and explain the various aspects of every thought by symbols, parables and narratives so as to apply you O Muhammad to the standard which is not level to their capacities so that Ahl al-Kitab dismiss the idea that you were taught by some of them. We also meant to give insight to those who comprehend the truth
You Muhammad just follow all that has been inspired to you and act upon it and in accordance with its precepts enjoined by Allah, your Creator; there is no Ilah but Him, and disregard those who incorporate with Him other deities
Had Allah willed, He would have graced them with a religious mind and they would not have incorporated with Him other deities. And you rest assured that We did not send you to watch over their innocence and folly, nor are you entrusted to their care or responsible for their ordinary pursuits of life
Do not assail those who incorporate with Allah other deities nor their idols with abusive language conveying injurious reproach lest they should revile Allah in retaliation by want of thought. Thus did We allure every nation acting upon a given belief to brighter present and happier destiny, then back to Allah, their Creator, all are destined to go, there and then shall He inform them of all that their minds and souls had impelled them to do
The infidels make a solemn declaration with an appeal to Allah that if a significant sign be revealed to them to evince both Muhammad’s Prophethood and integrity; they would most certainly accept it. Say to them: "Revelations and signs evincing my Prophethood and the truth of my mission rest in the hands of Allah alone. Nonetheless, how do you know, you Muslims, whether the infidels will or will not favourably respond to the miraculous sign
We divert their hearts, their feelings and their sight from one thought to another and throw their minds into confusion and We manoeuvre their disposition to induce difficulties sufficient to turn the edge of the finest wit that they lose sight of the truth as they did at the beginning and shall do henceforth. And We give them plenty of rope to allow them free scope of action in order to commit themselves to the loss in the maze of error
Had We sent down angels whom they could perceive by sight and resurrected for them the dead to discourse with them practical divinity, and thronged before their eyes, beings, matters and affairs of the spiritual world, they would not have acknowledged the truth nor would they have conformed to Islam unless it be the will of Allah. But most of them are so ignorant to realize this fact
Thus did We apply to every Prophet enemies characterized with Satanic attributes among both mankind and the Jinn who actuate each other with the feeling of confidence pertaining to fair-spoken discourse with implication of deceit. Had Allah willed they would never have dwelled on such settled behaviour as representative of feeling or opinion nor lingered round it. Therefore, let them sink under the vexations of their thoughtless minds and befool the minds and judgement of the people so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true
Such deceit attracts the victims of deception who deny the truth of the Hereafter and allow themselves to be deluded. They accept such deceitful discourse with consenting minds and open their hearts’ ears to such deceitful advice as these satanic incline them to propound, and perpetrate what their submitting minds and souls impel them to do
Say to them O Muhammad: "Shall I choose a judge besides Allah when it is He Who makes and gives the law whereas all other judges only interpret it? It is He Who has sent down -the Quran- distinctly expressing all that is meant leaving nothing merely implied," .Ahl al-Kitab know it is Allah's sent Book in all truth. Therefore, do not let O Muhammad those who hide the truth and contend with opposing arguments influence your feelings or put you in doubt
And now has the word of Allah, your Creator, answered the purpose and complied with the conditions truthfully and justly; His words are decisive, irrevocable and conclusive, and He is AL-Sami’ (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and AL-'Alim
And if you open your heart’s ears to people at large domiciled on earth, most of them shall alienate you from Allah's purpose and lead you in the wrong; they only follow the false suppositions and the incitement arising from the state of their minds and feelings; they simply lie and indeed they lie in their teeth
Allah, your Creator, knows best who intentionally or unintentionally alienates himself from His path of righteousness and alienates His purpose, just as He has cognizance of those whose feet are irresistibly drawn by magnetic influence, as it were, to the path of righteousness
Therefore, do not lend an ear to those who deny Allah and set themselves at defiance, but eat only of the flesh of the permitted animals slaughtered under the invocation of Allah's Name if indeed you have solemnly accepted His revelations and signs betokening His Authority
And why should you not eat of the flesh of the permitted animals slaughtered under the invocation of Allah's Name when He has designated to you the forbidden and admitted of relaxation under compelling circumstances! Indeed a good many lead themselves as well as others in the wrong upon their desires reflecting ignorance and want of knowledge. But Allah knows well those who disregard His commandments and go beyond the limits prescribed by Him
And avoid the impious, the immoral and the sinful act whether it be apparent or real, committed openly or secretly or suggested secretly to the mind. Indeed those who commit themselves to an evil line of conduct shall be requited with what is commensurate with their evil deeds
Therefore do not eat of the flesh of the permitted animal which has not been slaughtered under the invocation of Allah's Name; this is impiety. The Satanic suggest to the minds of those similarly disposed to contend with you with opposing arguments, and should you yield to their incitement of evil, you will have reverted to paganism
Does he who has been destitute of spiritual life and We inspirited with illumination and enlightenment to conduct himself well among the people and Providence his guide, compare with him who is led by the nose by the prince of darkness into deepest dismay where there is no escape! Thus were the infidels deluded with sensuous notions that in vain they wasted their days
Thus did We set in every city the principal persons among the people who set no bounds to their sensuous vain and evil desires to take cunning for a sinister and crooked wisdom, and lie in wait to deceive the people, when in fact they beset themselves with evils and malice but they fail to perceive
When an authoritative revelation or a sign is revealed to them, they interpret their thoughts in words: "We will not", they say: "Conform to Islam until we are accorded the like of what the Messengers of Allah were given by inspiration". Indeed Allah knows best whom to entrust with His divine message. But those who grow daily more and more wicked shall be subjected to humiliation in heaven's realm and shall be imprisoned in the realm of Hell in requital of, taking cunning for a sinister and crooked wisdom
Nonetheless, he whom Allah wills to guide to His path of righteousness, He comforts him with strange and mystical feelings and makes his breast -the seat of affections and emotions - amenable and responsive to the joyful thought of conforming to Islam. But he whom Allah decides to leave to his evil thoughts, He tightens his reins in despair and tightens his chest so as to be rendered impervious to a breath of spiritual knowledge; a feeling similar to that he experiences if he were climbing skywards to high altitudes*. Thus does Allah afflict those who deny Him with the torment laid on the damned
But why follow the crooked path when Allah's path is a path of piety, righteousness and virtue! We have expounded Our revelations to people who keep Allah in mind
Who shall make abode in heaven's realm in a world of peace in the August presence of Allah, their Creator, Who shall overshadow them by His gracious wing in return for the deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety
And on the Day -Allah- throngs them all, He shall say to them: "O you people of the Jinn, you seduced many among mankind and led them astray". Their allies among mankind shall say: "O Allah, our Creator, We had enjoyed each other and mutually profited one another until our predetermined time was fulfilled". Then says Allah: "The realms of Hell are where you make abode wherein you will have passed through nature to eternal suffering except as Allah wills. Allah, your Creator, is indeed Hakimun and 'Alimun
Thus do We induce those who confirm themselves in prepensed malice to be attracted to each other and be disposed to tutelary friendship by reason of their common attributes and of exercising themselves for the purpose of alienating people from Allah's purpose
In Day of Judgement shall all be addressed , thus: "O you people of the Jinn and mankind, asks Allah, "did you not receive Messengers, people of your own , to present you with My signs and narrate to you My revelations evincing both My Omnipotence and Authority, and warn you of this Momentous Day! "We plead guilty, they say, and we confess to the charge". They were deceived by the sensuous enjoyment, they regarded as the chief object of life, and they were witnesses of their own actions and of their deeds reflecting infidelity and disobedience to Allah
Among the set of Allah's correlated principles is His merciful dealing with the guilty who lacked knowledge of what is wrong and what is right, nor has he been guided or warned. Therefore, never would Allah, your Creator, do away with the cities when their inhabitants were unconscious of the wrong they were accustomed to do
There are grades for all; grades of appreciation and those of depreciation, grades commensurate with deeds, and Allah, your Creator, is not unaware of what people do
Allah, your Creator, is the Independent, the Absolute and the Source of mercy; if He wills, He can do away with you people and replace you by others of His choice just as He brought you into being from the posterity of other people
You people had better realize that all that you have been promised shall come to pass at the predetermined point of time and you shall not be able to avert what shall befall you nor things threatened
Say to them O Muhammad: "O you people of thoughtless minds, you may pursue what your minds and souls impel you to do, but I am steering my course of action by guiding indications set by Providence Who guides into all truth, and you shall come to know who shall be the winner of Allah's mercy Hereafter and who shall succeed in attaining the blissful and happy end. Never shall the wrongful find one instance of physical or spiritual prosperity Hereafter
And the idolaters, in their corrupted minds, portion out to Allah a share of what He Himself has created of crops and cattle, and another share they apportion to their idols which they regard as their predominant partners. And what they apportion to their partners reach them in full*; whereas what is apportioned to Allah is hardly spent in divine service**. Evil indeed is the proposition their minds assent to
Furthermore, infanticide - mainly females, occasionally a male - was imposed by the Satanic mediators as a religious rite which allured many of them to brighter worlds; a plan devised by the priests and the satanic to demoralize them and induce them to perfect their own ruin and throw their idolism into confusion. Had Allah willed they would not have indulged in such an evil practice. Therefore let them O Muhammad sink under the vexations of their thoughtless minds and befool the minds and the judgement of the people so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true
They classified cattle and crops into
Again they exercise their corrupted minds in creating another taboo. They say: "What these cattle carry in their wombs are reserved exclusively for our males and forbidden to our females, unless the offspring be a still-born then both sexes go shares". Allah shall requite them for this discrimination they falsely picture as a divine ordinance. He is Hakimun and 'Alimun
Losers indeed are those who foolishly and irreligiously committed the crime of infanticide, an evil wrought by want of thought. Who forbade the victuals provisioned for them; forging lies against Allah and criminally relating to Him falsehood. They have indeed erred and strayed and they missed the path of righteousness
He is it Who brought into being orchards, some trellised and others untrellised. He brought into being the palm trees and the whole of the agricultural yield of every district and season, varying in kind and in flavour, and the olives and the pomegranates besides many others of similar species and dissimilar class. Eat, therefore, of their flowers when they come to be fruits and grow ripe and pay, when you reap in harvest, what ought to be given in benevolence or in alms, but avoid prodigality, for Allah does not like the extravagant
And of the cattle, he availed you of some to carry your burdens and provide you with commodities and others for meat. Therefore, eat of what Allah has provisioned you, it is all replete with choice of all delights, and do not follow the footsteps of AL-Shaytan nor walk in the footsteps of those with characteristics befitting AL-Shaytan. He is indeed your avowed enemy
Another strained point upon which the whole unreasoning turns is their superstitious belief of dedicating what they consider sacred to their males denying and condemning their females. Thus they dedicate what sheep and goats, camels and oxen carry in their wombs to their males and exclude their females; a concept bringing Us to eight copulatory mates. Four of them are a pair of sheep and a pair of goats. Ask them O Muhammad: "Is it the two males or the two females that Allah has forbidden or is it what both females carry in their wombs! "Tell me who gave you this authority that you speak like a book if indeed you are declaring the truth
And to keep to the point-, there follow the pair of camels and those of oxen. Ask them: "Is it the two males or the two females that Allah has forbidden or is it what the two females carry in their wombs! "Or were you present as spectators and auditors at the execution of the alleged divine ordinance enjoined by Allah and you subscribe it in attestation thereof! " Who then is more wicked indeed than he who viciously and wrongful relates to Allah falsehood and acts as a guide to people when his ignorance has reached up unto heaven! Indeed Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness the vicious and wrongful of actions
Say to them O Muhammad: "I do not find among the divine ordinances inspired to me an act prohibiting an article of food consumed by mankind unless it be, a permitted animal found dead –carrion- or blood streaming from an animal or the flesh of swine; this is impure and unclean food. There is also the permitted animal slaughtered under the invocation of a name other than that of Allah. But under compelling circumstances and not in transgression shall Allah admit of relaxation; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
And to those imbued with Jewish doctrines and principles We forbade every animal with undivided hoof -camels, rabbits, hares- and of the oxen and the sheep We forbade them only their fat except the fat covering their backs and their entrails and the fat attached to the bones. This prohibition was imposed on them in requital of their vice and corruption. This is the truth We justly declare
Should they disbelieve you O Muhammad then say to them: " Allah's mercy is vast; it is extended to all, especially to those who repent. But His indignation against those who grow daily more and more wicked is irrevocable
And to excuse their unjustifiable infidelity, the idolaters will insolently say: "Had Allah willed, neither we nor our fathers would have incorporated with Him other deities nor would we have instituted taboos. Thus much did their predecessors charge their Messengers with falsehood until they tasted the fatal consequences of the evil way they conducted themselves in life. Say to them O Muhammad: "Do you have such knowledge serving as evidence to bring it to book? "You only follow the false suppositions and the incitement arising from the state of your minds and feelings; you simply lie and indeed you lie your teeth
Say to them: "The final and authoritative proof and pronouncement lie in the hands of Allah; had He willed, He would have guided you all to His path of righteousness
Say to them: "Bring your witnesses who are able to testify that Allah has forbidden all that you presumed He has" . And should they bear witness to this effect, then do not give credence to their testimony, they are lying, nor act upon their desires or the desires of those denying Our revelations and signs and the truth of the Hereafter who equalize Allah, with creatures of their fancy incorporating them with Him as a corporate deity
Say to them: "Come: I will give you an account of all that Allah has forbidden
You must not encroach upon the property of the orphan, unless it be with the motive of improving, advancing or raising it to a better quality or condition, until he or she reaches maturity and be able to take charge of it
And to complete worthily and bless with a divine issue, Allah says to you"; "This is My path of righteousness; follow it, you may attain moral straightness, goodness, integrity, virtue and piety. Do not tread other paths lest you miss the path chosen to guide you into all truth. " This is what He has commended unto you so that you may hopefully entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Aforetime We had given Mussa the Book -AL-Tawrah- completed to the taste of those who had obeyed Allah and conformed their will to His will. It was well expounded to interpret all matters and issues , guiding people into all truth and a mercy vouchsafed by Allah to His creatures; they might faithfully realize that they shall inevitably assemble before Him, at the predetermined point of time
And this Quran We sent down as a mercy and knowledge personified, confeing divine favour and invoking blessings on those who have the world all before them and Providence their guide. Therefore, follow its precepts and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah so that you may hopefully be recipients of His mercy
We have sent it down as the spirit of truth guiding into all truth lest you people render such a reason as to say: "The Book sent down to the people of Mussa and to those of Isa aforetime was expressed in their own tongues, in languages, we were not taught nor did we understand"; an excuse which it shall no longer be possible to justify
Or you may say: "Had we received their Book we would have regarded with more reverence and veneration, and in all things we would have conformed our will to Allah's will and we would have regarded His way but the one way of arriving at the truth". Now, there has come to you a convincing evidence of the truth of Our Messenger's mission and with him has come the Quran with illumination and enlightenment and a spirit of truth guiding into all truth and inviting Allah's mercy. Therefore, who is more wicked than he who denies Allah's revelations and signs and counsels deaf to Allah's disclosure of divine knowledge and spiritual enlightenment! Indeed, those who counsel deaf to Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority shall be put to the torment laid upon the damned in requital of closing their hearts, ears and their minds’ eyes to intellectual and spiritual enlightenment
Do they purpose to wait until some fitting event presents itself and they distinctly perceive the angels or perceive Allah, your Creator, Himself by sight or. Some of His signs evincing both His Omnipotence and the truth of your mission! But when such overwhelming signs present themselves, no soul which did not surrender itself earlier to Allah's Authority nor accomplished a useful purpose in virtue of its faith, shall profit of its submission now. Say to them: "Await the justice prepared above in heaven's realm and we will await it also
Indeed, those who broke the unity of their religion and separated it into parts in fact and in thought, in opinion and in feeling and in interest and set themselves at variance shall have much to answer for; you are not a part of them nor have you a personal relation with them nor will you be responsible for the way they conduct themselves in life. Their account rests with Allah Who shall inform them in Day of Judgement of all that they perpetrated of wrong doings
He who crowns the deed with equity, shall be rewarded with ten times what is commensurate with his equitable deed and he who commits himself to an evil line of conduct shall be requited with what is commensurate with the evil deed and no one shall ever be wronged
Say to them O Muhammad: "Allah, my Creator, has guided me to the path of glory, the path of moral straightness, goodness and integrity, virtue and piety; the path of righteousness, the path on which was founded the religion of Ibrahim, the Orthodox Muslim, who never incorporated with Allah other deities
Say to them: "Indeed, my act of worship and my pilgrimage and all religious rites incidental to it are acts due in discharge of the debt to Allah, my Creator and Creator of the universe, and my life and my death are processes asserted as His own
No partners does He have nor does He have anyone associated with Him in any function, act or course of action. To this fundamental truth I have been enjoined to adhere and I am the first who have conformed to Islam
Say to them: "Shall I choose a god other than Allah, the Creator, Who is the Creator of the whole and of all in all". And no soul imprints its deed with piety or with evil but it is to its own credit or discredit respectively, nor shall a soul bearing wrongs or not, bear the wrong of another, then back to Allah, your Creator, you are all destined to go. There and then shall He inform you of the detailed particulars of all the points upon which the whole unreasoning turned
He is it Who has inducted you on earth and made one generation inherit the other, and He promoted and exalted, in rank, honour, estimation, development, power, and wealth some above others, and arranged you in grades so as to test your qualities with what He has ordained for you. You had better realize that Allah, your Creator, is swift indeed in putting the law in execution and in effecting just retribution and He is also Ghafurun and Rahimun
(aIef) L. (lam) M. (meem) S. (sa)
A Book -the Quran- is revealed to you O Muhammad, laying upon you an immense responsibility for which you have been chosen. Therefore, let it not oppress your thoughts and feelings or depress your spirits, but use it and act upon it to warn those who deny the truth and to put those who have conformed to Islam in mind of their duties
And you people, act, in accordance with all that has been revealed to you from Allah, your Creator, and take not besides Allah tutelary guardians; they will influence you to revert in character to your aboriginal stocks. How little you people keep Allah in mind
How many towns did We reduce into a useless form in requital of their wickedness which grew more and more daily. Great was Our indignation against them that it spoke thunder on some at night while asleep* and on others during their siesta
When our anger was displayed in action, nothing did they say with pining regrets and vain repentance but: "we were wrongful of actions
Indeed, We will call to account all those to whom Messengers were sent; they shall have much to answer for, and We will question the Messengers whom We had sent
There and then will We narrate to all and each their biography with full knowledge of those who excelled in most parts and of those who failed in the most part so that they realize that We were never absent but Omnipresent
The balance of justice on this Momentous Day is truth personified. He, whose deeds of wisdom and piety surpass in weight, shall he and such persons rejoice beyond a common joy
And he whose iniquities surpass in weight shall he and such persons be losers, their iniquities and unjust treatment of Our revelations and signs have lost them their souls
We have firmly established you people on earth and endowed you with the means of living, and with conditions capable of being turned to use, yet how little are thankful
And We brought you into being by a special creation, and We fashioned you and gave you form and countenance and made you a determinate exalted being. Then We said to the augels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam -your archetype- in adoration" and the angels prostrated in comely order, praise and adoration, except Iblis who aspersed with calumny and declined
Then Allah asked: "What prompted you AL-Shaytan not to prostrate to Adam when I commanded you to do so!". "But I am of a better sort than he is". Said AL-Shaytan; "You created me from fire whereas You created him from clay
Then down you go", Allah said: " From this blissful state; you are doomed to a lower state". " You are here in heaven's realm in the August presence where you cannot display inordinate self - esteem nor exhibit an overweening opinion of your quality, you are dismissed from My heaven's realm, doomed to the vicissitudes of deposition and degradation
Give me respite", Said AL-Shaytan, "till the day they are resurrected
Allah said: "You are granted, like those with characteristics befitting you, a delay of punishment till the predetermined Eventful Hour
Then said AL-Shaytan: " Since You have dismissed me and sent me astray, I will lie in ambush in Your path of righteousness and seduce as many of mankind as I can to decoy therefrom and make vices lurk in the secret corners of their souls
And I will assail them emotionally and mentally from every side; I will leap at them from front and from behind, from their right and from their left to assail their virtue/and You shall find most of them not feeling or displaying gratitude
Go away from here", Allah said: "Despised and rejected; I will fill the realms of Hell with you and with the like of you and with all those of mankind who take you as a guide and accept your authority
As for you Adam", Allah said: "You and your wife make abode in Paradise and eat as you will and wherever you will; it is all replete with choice of all delights, and enjoy all that affords pleasure, but do avoid this particular tree; keep off it and do not draw near it lest you both be wrongful of actions
And there did AL-Shaytan sneakingly whisper them, instigating evil in their repositories of consciousness. He suggested secretly to their minds what made them unintentionally lose their modesty and decency and expose of their bodies what did put them to shame. He said to them: "Allah only forbade you this tree lest you should come to be angels or you be qualified to infinite existence
He swore to them that he was a sincere advisory having the attribute of advising and offering counsel
No sooner did they have a taste of the fruit of the forbidden tree than their private parts were exposed, and they realized, then, how shameful this was. They kept collecting leaves from the trees in Paradise to cover their naked bodies, which aroused their sense of shame. There and then, did Allah, their Creator, summon them by a call and say to them: " Did I not command you both to keep off this tree, and say to you that AL-Shaytan was and shall always be your avowed enemy
Indeed O Allah, our Creator", they said: "We were wrongful of actions, and unless You, in Whom we have the forgiveness of sins, extend Your mercy to both of us and forgive us, we will most certainly be great losers
Allah said: "Upon Our command We down all of you upon, to a lower state with mutual enmity to each other and you shall settle on earth where you make abode and livelihood for a predetermined point of time
Therein shall you live, and within there shall you die, and therefrom shall you be resurrected
O you Children of Adam: We have furnished you with a raiment to screen your nakedness, which offends your sense of modesty and decency, and with a top attire to adorn your personal appearance, and best of all is the vesture of piety. This is one of Allah's striking disclosures to man, so that –you- people may hopefully reflect
O you Children of Adam: Let not AL-Shaytan lead you astray nor tempt you to do what is wrong as he had allured your aboriginal parents by the use of cunning and deceitful attractions inducing them to lose their modesty and decency and expose their private parts and there, he attained the desired end and the goal to his will, besides prompting their expulsion from Paradise. He sees you, and so do his associates, whereas you do not perceive them by sight. We made the satanic take interest in those who deny Allah
And when the Pagans commit themselves to an evil line of conduct* they claim this has been the system on which their fathers were bent, and they insolently allege that Allah has enjoined this set of correlated principles belonging to their belief. Say to them O Muhammad: "Allah does not enjoin immorality nor ordain what is evil or impure, viscious or dissolute; do you people relate to Allah a world you see in a grain of sand or a heaven in a wild flower and from ignorance your comfort flows
Say to them: " Allah has enjoined the quality of being morally just and the principle of just dealing; He enjoined just conduct, integrity and righteousness, and that you set your minds toward Him at all times and your faces to Him at every mosque where you dutifully observe your act of worship, and invoke Him for mercy and blessings, devoting to Him alone, all religious rites on the ground that as he brought you into being so shall He resurrect you to go back to Him
Some, He has justly guided to His path of righteousness, and some deserved to be lost in the maze of error; they chose to take AL-Shaytan and the satanic as their guide and be under their tutelage besides that of Allah, and they deduce they are assuming the right course
O you children of Adam: Pay attention to your personal appearance and your apparel at every mosque where you dutifully observe your act of worship. The apparel often proclaims the man and his due respect for the dignity of the occasion, not to mention the solemnity of applying your minds to the presence of Allah. Do not be influenced by the Pagan's superstitions of permitting certain kinds of food and prohibiting others, but eat and drink of the permitted but avoid intemperance; Allah does not like the extravagant who carry anything to excess
Say to them O Muhammad: "Who has forbidden the material objects and articles of apparel Allah has produced to His servants to confer on them a combination of qualities affording keen pleasure to the senses especially that of sight, and charming the intellectual and moral faculties! And who has forbidden the virtues adorning the mind and piety adorning the character, qualities giving distinction! And who has forbidden the worthy and wholesome victuals Allah has provisioned" Say to them: such articles and objects, material and immaterial are reserved exclusively in. Day of Judgment for those whose hearts were impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues in life below. Thus, do We expound Our revelations and render Our discourse readily understood by those who reflect
Say to them: " Allah has forbidden indeed the evil line of conduct implying immorality, be it apparent or real, committed overtly or secretly or suggested secretly to the mind, and He forbids unwarranted severe course of action and that you people incorporate with Him other deities of material or immaterial nature whom He never authorized, and that you relate to Him a world you see in a grain of sand or a heaven in a wild flower and from ignorance your comfort flows
And to every people, all and each, We have ordained a definite point of time, and when their time is fulfilled never shall they be able to delay it or anticipate for one hour or infinitely less
O you children of Adam: when there come to you Messengers from among you to narrate to you My signs and recite to you My revelations betokening My Omnipotence and Authority, bow down your ears and listen graciously, and remember that he who entertains the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and prints his deeds with wisdom and piety shall have escaped censure; he and such persons shall have no ground for alarm nor shall fear or dread fall upon them nor shall they come to grief
Whereas those who reject faith and deny Allah and His ordinances and refuse to recognize Our revelations and signs shall be the inmates of Hell wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering
Who is more wrong than he who viscously and wrongfully relates to Allah falsehood or denies His revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority! Such persons do have what has been apportioned to them in life according to their good or bad books, just as they do have access to the share of the Book imparted to them by Our Messengers. And when Our angels of death disembody their souls at the predetermined point of time, they ask them: "where now are those you incorporated with Allah and invoked besides Him!". They have forsaken and renounced us " they say, and failed our expectation " So; they were witnesses of their own actions and of their deeds reflecting infidelity and disobedience to Allah
And in Day* of Judgment, they shall be told: "Join those nations and generations of the Jinn and mankind who preceded you in the realm of Hell. As often as a fresh nation, united in evil thought and deeds, is ushered in with gusts of firey wind, it pours maledictions upon its unwise sister, until they are all thronged in, then shall the latter turn their eyes upon the former and direct their spoken words to Allah, thus: " These, O Allah, our Creator, whom we thought were the example to follow, had indeed misled us and alienated us from Your purpose: requite them O Allah with double the torment in the fire" .There, Allah says: "But all and each suffers twice as much but you do not know
Then says the former to the latter: "You lacked intellectual, moral and spiritual perception and therefore you were not of advantage to us but we were both entangled in one party defiled with sin. There, Allah says: you have well deserved the torment in requital of what your minds and souls had impelled you to do
Indeed, those who denied Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and authority and their pride got the better of their prudence, are they who were born to be great losers. Never shall heaven open its gates nor shall they enter Paradise until the camel passes through the needle's eye: thus, do We requite the sinful who grow daily more and more wicked
Hell shall be the bed they have made for themselves as a result of their iniquities; they shall be tossed in blankets of fire. Thus do We requite the wrongful
But those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety, realize that We do not charge a soul with more than it can bear. It is they who have the rightful claim to Paradise wherein they shall have passed through nature to Eternity
We will delete all that was embedded of bitter ill -feeling from their bosoms and blot out all that lurked in their memories of grudge and hatred so as to make the clouds of the past dissolve in the glorious light .They shall jointly rejoice beyond a common joy, and in the ecstasy of their joy they shall enjoy the blissful rivers flowing beneath them and interpret their feeling of gratitude in words, thus: " Praise be to Allah and exalted are His glorious attributes: He guided us to His path of righteousness, and without His guidance we would have missed it and we would have been alienated from His purpose" ."Indeed His Messengers have brought us illumination and enlightenment and brought the truth which dawned upon us and upon those who, had worshipped stocks and stones earlier". There and then they shall be told: "This is Paradise of which you have come into possession by right and divine grant
Then shall those rejoicing in Paradise call the inmates of Hell and say to them: "We have found what Allah had promised us the truth personified: have you found what Allah had promised you to be true!". "Indeed we have", say the inmates of Hell. And there, shall one of the sentinels, declare thus: "Allah's curse is cast upon the wrongful of actions
The wrongful who stood in the way to prevent Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth, making it their aim to pervert the truth and crook the path of righteousness to their own ends, and never did they acknowledge the truth of the Hereafter
Between those in the realm of Paradise and these in the realm of Hell, there shall be a partition veiling those from these; at its height, stand men* able to distinguish those in Paradise from these in Hell by the language spoken by their countenances. They greet those in Paradise with the customary formula "Peace be upon you";people to whom paradise was not particularly their aim but only the obedience to Allah
And when their eyes are turned toward the inmates in the realm of Hell, they pray: O Allah our Creator, we pray and beseech You not to associate us with the wrongful of actions
Then those on the heights shall address those whom they recognize by the language spoken by there countenances: " Do you now realize that all that you had amassed of wealth and all the multitudinous you associated with did not avail you a useful purpose nor did your inordinate self-esteem
They add: "Are those not they you declared on oath that Allah would never extend His mercy to them!". "As you can clearly see, Allah has greeted them and said to them". I bid you a hearty welcome; go into the world of splendour and surpassing beauty, the world of Paradise and Eternity where you shall have no ground for alarm nor shall you come to grief
Then shall those in the realm of Hell call those in the realm of Paradise saying: "Afford us some water or some of what Allah has provisioned you". In response they say: Allah has forbidden them to those who denied Him
Who treated their religion mockingly and amused themselves with its principles and were deceived by the sensuous enjoyment they regarded as the chief object in life. "There, Allah says to them ": Now is the Day We forget you and you shall be left to twist and turn in the scorching flames of Hell in vindication of the right you had willfully forgotten; you neglected the noble discourse addressed by Our Messengers, and you failed to advance what would have served as a future security on this Momentous Day and you disregarded Allah and His revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority
We send down a Book expounding and distinctly expressing the sum of what is vaguely known and what is unknown and with the divine knowledge implying firm belief of what is true on sufficient grounds, a Book based on Our Omniscience of the whole and of all in all, serving as a guide and a mercy to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
Do they -the infidels- purpose to wait until fitting events fulfill the prophecies and all that has been promised in the Book! But when such overwhelming events present themselves shall those who had disregarded the promise and willfully neglected it say: " Indeed; now we do realize that the Messengers of Allah had brought us the truth which dawned on us with illumination and enlightenment". "Are there intercessors to intercede for us or can we be permitted to go back to life below to decide more wisely, think better than what our minds and souls had impelled us to do! " Indeed they have lost their own souls and have been forsaken and renounced by those whom they presumed to share with Allah His divine nature, who failed their expectation
Indeed; Allah, your Creator, is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days* determined by His own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar, then He set Himself on the throne of supremacy and dominion and of grace and mercy. He causes the day to lose its identity and its character by absorption into the night; both revolving swiftly in pursuit of each other and one dies into the other**. And the sun, the moon and the stars, He has governed by His cosmic laws and reduced to a state of subservience by His command. Indeed to Him belongs the creation of the whole and of all in all. Praise be to Allah, Creator of the universe and extolled are His glorious attributes
Invoke Allah, your Creator, with bated breath and whispering humbleness and in secret; He does not like the law transgressors, who go beyond the limits prescribed by Him
Nor does He like those who create discord and make mischief on earth after it has been set in order. And invoke Him with mingled feeling of dread of his just punishment and with reverence, hope and expectation of His mercy and blessings His mercy is indeed in immediate proximity of those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
He is it Who sends forth the wind as a forerunner of His mercy heralding a joyful event The watery vapor condenses and floats in the upper air and when it is about to gender a storm We drive it by high winds to a dead or droughty land where it pours its rain and with it We cause the various products to spring up from the soil*. Similarly do We resurrect the dead; an action consequent on Allah's will and it is hoped people will ponder
Physically, the rich soil responds favourably to the fertilizing showers of rain and yields, Allah willing, a rich harvest, -and spiritually, the godly soul' and the clean heart respond favourably to the fertilizing religious conviction and yield piety-, whereas rain physically and admonition spiritually evoke no response in both the bad soil and the evil souls. Thus do We orient Our revelations to circumstances and requirements expounding them to people impelled to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
We send Nuh to his people to prevail upon them to recognize Allah. He said: "O my people worship Allah and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; you have no Ilah but Him! "I fear for you an immense. punishment on a Momentous Day
But those of his people in whose hearts reigned vices and follies said to him: " Indeed, we see that you are lost in the maze of error
My people", he said, "I do not hold a mistaken belief nor do I stand in error or wish to put you in the wrong, but I am a Messenger from Allah, the Creator of the whole and of all in all
A Messenger who has come to relate to you the message entrusted to me by Allah, my Creator, and to advise you and offer you counsel". "You had better realize that I have knowledge of the truth imparted to me by Allah, and you just do not know what is true and therefore will not know what is good
Do you people consider it exceptional to a degree that excites astonishment that Allah sends to you illumination and enlightenment at the hands of a man from your midst in the capacity of a spectacle and a warning to guide you into all truth and induce you to recognize Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him so that you may hopefully invite His mercy and blessings
Yet they disbelieved him, refused to give him credence and thought he was conveying a false message In consequence, We rescued him together with those who willingly accepted his message. We put them on board ship -the Ark- and We drowned, in the flood, those who drowned themselves in sin and denied Our signs. Their minds' eyes were indeed blind
And to the people of 'Ad (the 'Adites), We sent one from among their brotherhood, the Messenger Hud, who said to them: "O my people, worship Allah and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; you have no Ilah but Him; can you not open your mind's eyes, reverence Him and lift to Him your inward sight
But those of his people in whose hearts reigned vices, follies and falsehood said to him. "We can see that you are an impudent simpleton, and we think you are a great liar
Hud said: "My people, I am not deficient in sense or intelligence nor does my action bespeak weakness of mind. I am a Messenger who is sent to you by Allah, Creator of the whole and of all in all
I have been sent to relate to you Allah's messages of truth guiding into all truth, and I am a sincere and an honest adviser who gives you counsel and cautions you against denying Allah
Do you people consider it exceptional to a degree that excites astonishment that Allah sends to you illumination and enlightenment at the hands of a man from your midst in the capacity of a spectacle and a warning to guide you into all truth! " "You had better recall to mind his favours and impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude for the efficacious grace He conferred on you; He made you the inheritors of the people of Nuh and imparted to you a wealth of knowledge, and privileged you with a distinguished stature more than He graced other nations". Therefore, remember with gratitude and humility the privileges He bestowed on you so that Heaven may prosper you
Yet they said to him: "Did you come to us O Hud to induce us to worship Allah alone and renounce the form of religious worship practiced by our fathers and the gods to whom they paid reverence and veneration!". " Then bring to pass the punishment you have promised, if in fact you declare the truth
Now", said Hud, " you have confirmed yourselves in prepensed malice and the prophesy of Allah's punishment and indignation against you is thus ratified". "Do you contend against Allah in favour of your named idols you and your fathers designated as gods, objects Allah never authorized! " "You Just await the justice prepared above in heaven's realm; I will await it also
And so We rescued him together with those who conformed their will to Allah's will by the grace of Our mercy, and We uprooted from the earth those who denied Our signs; they were wrongful of actions
And to the people of Thamud (the Thambdites) We sent their brother Saleh who said to then: "O my people worship Allah and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites you have no Ilah but Him. "There has come to you a sign from Allah, your Creator, evincing both the truth of my mission and Allah's supremacy. It is this she-camel which is exclusively His own". " Let it feed freely on pasture in Allah's earth, and keep her out of harm's way lest you be heavily punished
Recall to mind His favours and impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude for the efficacious grace He conferred on you. He made you the inheritors of the people of 'Ad (the 'Adites) and made the earth your world of destined habitation". "on its plains you erect buildings, palaces and castles, and its mountains you hew and carve into homes". "Therefore, remember with gratitude and humility the privileges He bestowed on you and stop making mischief on earth and refrain from creating discord
But the extravagant in their accounts of themselves among his people in whose hearts reigned vices, follies and falsehood said to those whom they viewed with contempt on account of conforming to Islam: " Do you really believe that Saleh has been sent by Allah, his Creator, in the capacity of an Messenger?" "Indeed We do", they said, "and We acknowledge his mission and give credence to the spirit of truth imparted to him from Heaven guiding into all truth
But those who proudly deny just requests said: " We refuse, to acknowledge or give credence to what you have accepted with consenting minds
They manifested repugnance and disabled the she - camel by cutting her hamstring muscles in opposition and disobedience to Allah's command and authority and they said to Saleh: "Now, let us see how you will bring to pass the catastrophe you threatened that heaven would inflict if indeed you are an Messenger sent by Allah
There, did the destructive convulsion of the earth's surface seize them and reduced them to a useless form and laid them prostrate and dead under the ruins of their demolished homes
But Saleh had warned them beforehand of the impending danger, and when he was met with defiance, he relinquished the prospect of their conformity to Islam. And when heaven avenged its own right, he turned away expressing his grief, Thus: "My people", he said "I conveyed to you Allah's message and His warning and I advised you against disobedience to Allah and I announced the event, but you do not seem to like those who give you advice
And Lut who said to his people: "Do you commit such an immorality as is contrary to the general inherent character and moral constitution and never has it been practiced by Humans before
You certainly have sensuous desire for men in lieu of women, you are indeed a people given to excess and perversion
But what was the response of his people other than to say: " Oust Lut, his family and those who fell in line of your town, and drive them away; they are averse to our disposition and wish to cleanse themselves of what they imagine to be moral defilement
So, We rescued him together with his family but not his wife who was just as wicked as those to whom she adhered
We poured down upon them a rain of hard baked clay of brimstones, and you can see the fatal consequence of those who were steeped in crime
And to the people of Madyan (Midian), We sent their brother Shu'aib, who said to them: "O my people worship Allah and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; you have no Ilah but Him. There has come to you a sign from Allah, your Creator, evincing both the truth of my mission and Allah's supremacy. Therefore, dispense the measure and the weight equitably to the full and do not scant peoples' goods and chattels, chattels personal, chattels real nor chattels interest nor devalue what is valuable, nor create discord or make mischief on earth after it has been set in order". " This is best for you if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Nor lie in ambush" he added, in every paths threatening those of you who have conformed to Islam, obstructing the path leading them to moral straightness and uprightness, goodness and integrity, virtue and piety, making it your aim to pervert the truth and crook the path of righteousness to your own ends"." Remember when for once you were a small minority and how Allah made you multiply and reach the status of a majority, and look how fatal was the consequence of those who were characterized by acts of prepensed malice
However, since some of you have acknowledged my mission and conformed their will to Allah's will whereas others have not, then have patience and await the event when the justice prepared in heaven's realm be executed by Allah; He is it Who gives the law whereas all other judges just interpret it; He excels all those who sit in judgement
But the extravagant in their accounts of themselves among his people in whose hearts reigned vices, follies and falsehood said to him: "We will oust you of our town together with those who have followed you, and drive all of you away unless you desert your system of faith and worship in favour of ours". There, Shu'aib said: "Even though, with execrations, do we detest your system and shrink from it with horror
If we should favour your system of faith and worship", said Shu'aib, "then we will have viciously and wrongfully related to Allah falsehood and denied His revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority". "And how could we turn renegade after we have been graced by Allah Who has delivered us from such an evil system of faith bringing nothing but harm here and Hereafter!" "This shall never happen", he added, "unless it be Allah's will that we be destined to lose our senses and be harmed by courage". "Allah's knowledge encompasses the wide circle of the whole and of all in all and Omniscience is asserted as His own.". " In Allah, our Creator, do we trust and to Him do we and our people plead our causes and He shall justly decide them". "O Allah, our Creator", he prayed, " You are the best and the most competent of all judges Who decide a case as put by opponent parties
There and then said the wicked leaders among his people to those who did not gather to their leaders' standard: " If you should take Shu'aib as a guide and espouse his cause, then you shall be great losers
But soon thereafter did the destructive convulsion of the earth's surface seize them and reduced them to a useless form and laid them prostrate and dead under the ruins of their demolished homes
Consequently, those who treated Shu'aib as one who passes himself off as someone other than he is, were inflicted with an irretrievable disaster that they looked as if they had never dwelt nor flourished whereat they perished; those who treated Shu'aib as an imposter were born to be great losers
But Shu'aib had warned them beforehand of the impending danger, and when he was met with defiance, he relinquished the prospects of their conformity to Islam. When heaven avenged its own right, he turned away expressing his thoughts in words, thus: "My people", he said, "I conveyed to you Allah's message and his warning and advised you against disobedience to Allah and I announced the event, therefore how can I grieve over people who obstinately denied Allah
Nor did We ever send a Prophet to a town* with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth but We afflicted its people with misfortunes and wedded them to calamities in the hope they would, for their own sake, humble themselves to Allah
Then We replaced the unfavorable conditions and hardships by favourable circumstances until they advanced in power, importance and prosperity and proclaimed in ignorance that what has befallen them of misfortunes happened to their fathers before, "and", they added, " it is only time that controls the wavering balance of fortune". In consequence, We suddenly seized them and dressed them with ruin and We caught them unawares
Had the town's folk conformed to the system of faith and worship as ordained by Allah, and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him, We would have opened for them all channels of mercy, blessings and prosperity from the realm of heaven above them and from the earth beneath their feet. But they obstinately and insolently denied Our signs betokening Authority and by consequence We seized them and reduced them to ruins
Are the town's folk certain in their minds they are secure against Our wrath which may speak thunder and be displayed in action at night while they are asleep
Or are the town's folk certain in their minds they are secure against Our wrath which may speak thunder and be displayed in action in broad day light while conducting themselves in an unprofitable or an evil way
Do they feel secure and from ignorance, their comfort flows to the extent that they can escape an event destined to happen according to Allah's plan! Indeed, no one in his own sound mind feels secure against Allah's predetermined actions but those who are born to be losers
Can those people who have inherited the earth not perceive the signal instances of punishment which befell their predecessors and served as a deterrent! Do they not realize that We control their fate and that if We willed, We could requite them as and when We please for their iniquities and imprint their hearts with dullness of comprehension that they counsel deaf, unwilling to hear admonition
These were the town's folk who were united in evil thoughts and deeds narrating their course of events and leading to a final catastrophes Their Messengers came to them carrying evidence sufficient to establish their delegated Authority to implement Our statutes. But they refused to acknowledge what they and their fathers denied before. Thus does Allah imprint the hearts of the disobedient who grow daily more and more wicked with dullness of comprehension
We found most of them irresolute and untrue to their covenant and promise, and in the hearts of most of them reigned vices, follies and falsehood
In succession, We sent Mussa to Pharaoh and his people in whose hearts reigned vices and falsehood and We equipped him with signs demonstrating delegated divine power and authority. But they were wrongful of actions; and there, you can see what was the end of those who were characterized with prepensed malice
Mussa said to Pharaoh: "I am, O Pharaoh, a Messenger carrying a divine message from Allah, Creator of the universe
With great care and solemnity do I relate to Allah nothing but the truth. "l do hereby present you people with a sign from Allah, your Creator, evincing both the truth of my mission and Allah's supremacy, and by virtue of this sign and of Allah's delegated authority I demand the release of Bani Israel from bondage and they be permitted to go with me to where they are free to practice Allah's system of faith and worship
Pharaoh said: "If indeed you have a divine sign in your sleeve, then present it to view if you are telling the truth
Mussa cast his staff on the ground, and instantaneously it was transformed into a serpent personified
And he drew his hand from the folds of his garment and there it was instantaneously transfigured in a radiance of white divine light
But then, said those among his people in whose hearts reigned vice and falsehood: "this man is indeed a necromancer skilled in magic, and the works of the Devil are being made manifest in him
He means", they added, to oust you people of your land and drive you away. "Therefore what course of action do you suggest we should take in the face of this problem
They suggested to Pharaoh they should adapt themselves and conform to the time and circumstances so as to gain time and added: "The time to degrade and defeat him and his brother has not come yet". "Meanwhile, send, O Pharaoh, some of your recruits to the cities to gather to themselves the multitude of men who practice magic
And they bring back those among them who are skilled in the art of necromancy
The experts and skilful in the art of necromancy came to Pharaoh and asked him. "Shall we be rewarded if we happen to prevail and gain superiority over them
Indeed", said Pharaoh, "and you shall be in a position that entitles you to be among my retinue
They said to Mussa: " Would you like to cast your artifice upon the ground first to present to view what you have up your sleeve, or shall we cast ours first
You cast yours first", said Mussa, and when they did, they fascinated and bewitched the viewers eyes to the extent that they actuated them with the feeling of terror when they manifested forth their glorious performance
There and then did We inspire Mussa to cast his staff upon the ground and there, it counter-worked their ingenious expedient and swallowed all that they cast upon the ground of fraudulent devices of a mean and deceptive kind
And there, did heaven, earth and men evidence the truth which was justified by facts and results, just as they evidenced falsehood which was condemned by the annulment of all their various objects of fiction and delight
There, before the multitudes and right before Pharaoh's eyes a damned defeat was made; those who had the expertise were reduced to impotence and were humiliated by defeat
Overwhelmed with wonder, the sorcerers bowed to the ground in comely order, praise and admiration
They declared, thus: "We do yield to the claims of Mussa and we surrender ourselves to Allah, the Creator of the universe
The Ilah of Mussa and Harun
There, Pharaoh said to them: "Have you yielded to his claims and surrendered yourselves to his Allah without my permission!" Indeed", he added, "This is a skilful deceit designed to outwit the inhabitants of the city to drive them out from hence, and in consequence you shall come to know how heavily you shall pay for this
I will amputate your hands and feet on opposite sides, and I will have you all crucified
Gladly", they said to Pharaoh, "We welcome your decision which shall haste us unto Allah Who confers on us the glorious privilege of martyrs
And they added: "Do you take vengeance on us just because we have acknowledged the signs of Allah when they were presented to us indicating clearly Allah's Omnipotence and Supremacy and because we asserted to the spirit of truth guiding into all truth!". And they prayed: O Allah, our Creator, inspire patience and just confidence to us and occasion our death as men who have conformed to Islam
There and then said those of Pharaoh's people in whose hearts reigned vice, malice and falsehood: "O Pharaoh, would you set Mussa and his people free so as to create discord in the land and play the mischief with your subjects and renounce you and your gods, disclaiming obedience to your statutes!". " But, Pharaoh said: We will kill their sons, and to serve our purpose, spare their women, and we will gain mastery over them and be their supreme controlling power
Implore Allah's aid", said Mussa to his people, "and have recourse to prayer, for more things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of, and resort to patience to possess your souls". "The earth", he added, " belongs to Allah. He apportions it as a heritage to whom He will of His servants, and the happy outcome falls to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
But in despair did his people say to him: " We have been burdened with cruel impositions before you came to us and since you have been with us". " May Allah, your Creator, said Mussa , reduce your enemy into a useless form and designate you the successors in the land, and then He shall see how you conduct yourselves in life
We subjected Pharaoh and his people to a retributory punishment and made them suffer heavy damage. They were pined with dearth, hunger and drought for years that they may hopefully humble themselves to Him and lift to Him their inward sight
Whenever they had good fortune on their side they attributed it to their merit, and whenever they were befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity, they attributed it to Mussa and his people who were esteemed birds of evil omen presaging some direful calamity. Indeed, events portending good or evil and all that is destined to happen, rest in the hands of Allah, notwithstanding the mould of a man's fortune is in himself, and the event when justified is sanctioned by Allah, but most of them fail to perceive this fact
Being arrogant, obstinate men of little intelligence they said to Mussa: "No matter how impressive and exciting the signs may be never shall we be convinced nor shall you be able to bring us to acknowledge the truth of your mission
And there, We plagued them at intervals with
As often as they were troubled grievously, they appealed to Mussa, to invoke Allah. His creator", they said, "in virtue of what He conferred on you of sufficient grace, to deliver us from this burdensome affliction which is exhaustive to the mind, and if you do we promise to acknowledge the truth of your mission and release the Children of Israel from bondage so that they be free to go with you
Whenever We removed the cause of distress for a determined period of time to give them a chance to bring themselves to their senses, they promised Mussa they would pay heed. But no sooner they recovered than they broke their moral obligation, as if to confess themselves mistaken was opposed to their sense of personal dignity
In consequence, We took just vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea in requital of their denial of Our signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority and their oblivion thereto
And by divine grant did We bring those oppressed, into possession of the eastern and western parts of the land We had blessed*, and thus has the good word of Allah, your Creator, answered the purpose, and complied with the conditions of Bani Israel for their patience and endurance. And We ruined and buried all that Pharaoh and his people had erected of splendid structures and all that they laid as means or support
And We brought Bani Israel safely across the sea, and there, they came across a people who paid divine honours to idols**. They demanded of Mussa to make for them an idol as an object of worship similar to the idols worshipped by those people. In response, said Mussa: "You people are indeed ignorant and you are a wicked impudent boldfaced people who have no shame of their sins
These people", he said, "worship dumb idols made of stone subject to min. And vain is he who puts his hope in an object of worship besides Allah
Would I", he added, "induce you to pay reverence and veneration to a deity other than Allah, the Creator, and adore him (or it) with appropriate acts and rites, when it was He Who confined to you such prerogative as to be the chosen for His mercy and blessings out of all people
And through His Omnipotence and Authority, We delivered you from the state of bondage and from the cruel impositions laid upon you by the Pharaonic who brutally slaughtered your sons and spared your women, and this was indeed a severe but a sure test of your actions and reactions echoing your true beliefs and the prevalent inclination among you
Then We ordained the divine assignation for Mussa and arranged the place and the time when We would be exposed to his mental view after he had completed the exclusive religious devotion imposed on him for thirty nights complemented by ten more nights to total forty nights, the requisite for granting him an audience. And when the set time was fulfilled and Mussa was ready to have spiritual audience of Allah, his Creator, he said to his brother Harun: "Take my place and act for me among my people and improve the state of things and put an end to abuse, disorder and malpractice and do not yield to those who are characterized by acts of prepensed malice
When Mussa came to the place set for Our assignation, the hallowed environment spoke Allah's presence proclaimed by sound. And when Allah spoke to Mussa, he expressed his wish, thus: "O Allah, my Creator", he asked, "may I perceive you by sight!". "You shall not be able to see Me", said Allah, "but look at the mountain", if it remains standing in its place, you shall then see Me. And when Allah manifested to the mountain an infinitely short flash of His mercifully invisible glorious light, the mountain was levelled with the ground*. Terribly shocked, Mussa dropped unconscious, and when he recovered from the swoon, he prayed: "Praise be to You O Allah and extolled are Your glorious attributes; in lowliest plight do I stand repentant and I am the first and foremost of those who conform to Your will
I have chosen you O Mussa", said Allah, "by preference out of all people to convey My divide message and My discourse of practical divinity revealed directly to you". "Therefore, take all that I have imparted to you with heart and hand with heart and soul, and act strongly upon it and impel yourself to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
We set down for him in writing on the plates all that bore reference to every subject, affair, event, circumstance, concern, contention, dispute, litigation and the like, distinctly expressing all that was meant, leaving nothing merely implied. And We commanded him to act strongly upon all that was imparted to him and to enjoin his people to adopt those divine precepts that would be in their best interests. And We added: "I will show your people the destined desolate abode and the destined insecure condition of those who grew daily more and more wicked
I will", said Allah, "deafen the hearts' ears of those whose pride gets the better of their prudence, who exhibit unjustifiable inordinate self-esteem in the world they live on". Whenever they see a sign clearly indicating Allah's Authority, they take pride in setting it to nought, and when they see the path of righteousness, they simply avoid it, but when they see the path of wickedness, they joyfully follow it, this turn of mind accords well with their persistent denial of Our signs they have been oblivious of
And those who refuse to recognize Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority and reject the truth of Resurrection and the audience of Allah in Day of Judgement are born to be losers; their hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness. Shall they be requited but with what is commensurate with their deeds
Influenced by idolatrous Egypt, the people of Mussa took advantage of his absence on the Mount, being absorbed in the intense spiritual communion with Allah, and melted all their gold ornaments and built a body in the image of a calf* lowing like cattle when down wind. Did they not perceive that it was mute! Never did it speak to them nor would it guide them or determine the course of events! Yet they reverenced it and adored it with appropriate acts and rites, and were wrongful of actions
When they realized that they had committed themselves to an evil line of conduct and have wandered from the path of righteousness they said: " Now, unless Allah, our Creator extends His mercy to us and forgives us, we will most certainly be great losers
And when Mussa returned and found that his people have wronged themselves, he strongly resented their evil act, and so great was his indignation against them. Grieved at heart, he said: "Evil indeed is what your minds and souls have you to do; did you wish Allah's punishment be hastened on! He dropped the plates and dragged his brother by the head, laying the blame on him, But Harun said to him: " O son of my mother; the people judged me wanting in power and authority over them and almost killed me". "Therefore, do not let my enemies gloat over me and rejoice at my misfortune, nor should you associate me with the wrongful of actions
Mussa then realized his unjustified assault upon his brother and turned to Allah invoking His forgiveness on behalf of himself and his brother, and added: "O Allah, our Creator, we pray and beseech You to admit us into the realm of Your mercy
Indeed those who reverenced the calf and adored it with appropriate acts and rites shall come within the measure of Allah's wrath and shall be incensed with humiliation in life below, for thus do We requite those who intentionally assert what is false
But those who commit themselves to an evil line of conduct and soon thereafter stand repentant in lowliest plight and return to the obedience of Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues shall find Allah Ghafurun (forgiving), and Rahimun (Merciful)
When Mussa returned to his settled calmness, he picked up the plates comprising in their text the spirit of truth guiding into all truth, and Allah's mercy toward those who fear testing Allah's indignation
There, did Mussa choose from the innocent among his people seventy persons, in compliance with Allah's command to present themselves at the divine assignation. When they gathered at the arranged time and place, fearful echoes thundered in their ears and the earth's surface convulsed under their feet as an expression of strong divine reproach against those among them who committed themselves to the most evil conduct. There and then did Mussa pray, thus: "O Allah, my Creator: had You willed you would have planted their Hereafter and mine before now". "Would you destroy us in requital of the evil committed by the simpleton among us!". " It is Your means of trial, You use it to subject people to the test and consequently deafen the hearts' ears of whom You will and open the minds' eyes of whom You will, You are our Tutelary Protector". "We beseech you to forgive us and to have mercy on us; You are the Most Merciful of all who forgive
He added: "We pray and beseech You to bestow on us Your prevenient and efficacious grace here, and Your efficacious grace Hereafter; we have surrendered ourselves to You and our purpose and cause to Your divine service". "My punishment", said Allah, "is a penalty I inflict on whom I will, and My mercy is extended to the wide circle of the all; I will accord it to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Me. It is those who give alms and give credence to Our revelations and signs, with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Who acknowledge the mission of Our Messenger, the unlettered Prophet whom they find well described in their AL-Tawrah (Torah) and AL-Injil (Gospel). Who enjoins them equity and the general principles of justice and forbids them all that is wrongful and obscene; He informs them of all that Allah has rendered lawful for them to eat and of all that is unlawful. He shall release them from the rules fettering them and from the restrictions imposed upon them, and release their minds from what had burdened them of anxious thoughts. Therefore, those who recognize his mission; give credence to his message, honour him, afford him the help he needs and act in accordance with the spiritual and intellectual enlightenment imparted to him, shall be the recipients of Allah's mercy and blessings and it is these whom Heaven shall prosper
Say to them O Muhammad: O you people: you had better believe that I have been sent to you all with a divine message from Allah Who has the rightful claim to the heavens and the earth. Allah Who has the supreme controlling power and the absolute authority over them; there is no Ilah but Him Who gives life and occasions death. Therefore, you people had better believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and accept with consenting mind His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet who solemnly believes in Allah and His divine words -those inspired to him and to other Messengers before him-. You had better give credence; to his statement and discourse on practical divinity and follow him so that you may hopefully be guided to the path of righteousness
Among the People of Mussa are some who used the spirit of truth to guide people into all truth and used it to implement the general principles of justice
And We separated them into twelve divisions, nations as it were, - characterized by common descent from one of the twelve sons of Ya'qub (Jaco)
We said to them "You make abode in this town* and eat as you will, wherever you will. It is all replete with choice of all delights. Enjoy all that is wholesome and affords pleasure, but let your bosoms surge up and answer thanks and express your thoughts in words invoking Me to relieve your hearts and unload your burden of sins", "Humble yourselves and bow your knees to Me as you go through the gate ", "then and only then will I forgive your iniquities and reward those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety with what runs higher than what corresponds with their piety
But the wrongful of actions exchanged the virtuous spoken discourse authorized by heaven for the false discourse of their own making, and in consequence did Heaven come upon them with a forcible impact of a torturing punishment in requital of their wickedness
Ask them about the town which stood by the see-front* where their minds and souls impelled them to transgress Allah's commandment and break the Sabbath ordained by Allah to be set apart for rest and worship. The fish were made to come to the surface on the Sabbath day, and to dive deep on other days; a means of trial to test their prevalent inclination. As was expected, being wicked, they yielded to temptation
Those indifferent among the people of Mussa, said to those concerned: "why waste your breath admonishing people destined to suffer annihilation or condemnation!". "This said the concerned, "is only to discharge the duty imposed by Allah, your Creator, toward these people, they might hope fully open their hearts' ears and be dutiful to Him
But when they counselled deaf to exhortation, We rescued those who urged them to laudable conduct and to doing homage and honour to Almighty Allah, and We put to the torment of misery and distress those wrongful of actions in requital of their prepensed malice
When they insolently persisted in disobedience and buried exhortation in oblivion, We laid their transgression to their charge and decreed that they be monkeyfied and that their monkey- like character and behaviour be viewed with contempt, and that they be despised and rejected of men
There and then did Allah, your Creator, proclaim He would send against them those who would persecute them till the Day of Resurrection. Allah, your Creator, is swift indeed in putting the law in execution, and He is also Ghafurun and Rahimun
And We split them into separate aggregates forming communities among the populations of the various countries of the world; Among them are those who are virtuous, who instruct men in the way of righteous living, and others who are contrary in nature, in character and in tendency, who flourish on wickedness. We have tried them with interchange of favours and efficacious grace and with disfavors, misfortunes and disgrace that they may hopefully be dutiful to Allah
Then, there came their successors on whom the weight of AL-Tawrah had devolved and the responsibility of subscribing to its precept had fallen. Yet they chose to go by the world and its vanities, and unmerited forgiveness haunted their imagination; They said: "We will be forgiven our iniquities", and in vanity they wasted their days. Every opportunity favourable to a wicked end or purpose gave them occasion to a burst of merriment. Do they not recall to the mind that they did subscribe to the covenant Allah had revealed in AL-Tawrah which they have carefully studied; the covenant forbidding them to relate to Allah but the truth and emphasizing that the Hereafter is infinitely far better and more advantageous to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah. Can you - people- not reflect
Nonetheless, those who adhere to AL-Tawrah and abide by it and observe their act of worship shall be recipients of Allah's mercy and blessings; We do not withhold nor withdraw the grateful return due to those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
And you Ahl AL-Kitab had better recall to the mind that once when your fathers camped at the foot of the Mount and heaven thundered and the awe - inspiring echoes thundered in their ears as We entered with them into a covenant, and We stabilized the Mount above them when it shook with such fits of awe for the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and they thought it was collapsing over their heads. There and then did We say to them: " Adhere to all We have imparted to you -AL-Tawrah- and observe the code of discipline and body of regulations and hold them in esteem and hold to your promise and pay attention and regard to it and be mindful of Our commandments, you may hopefully entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Me
Allah your Creator brings forth the progeny of the Children of Adam from their backs. Symbolized by a figure in human form so as to be witnesses of their own reaction to Allah, they were asked: "Am I not your Creator!" "Indeed You are", they answered. "Then", Allah said, "You cannot deny this in Day of Judgment with the excuse that you were not aware of this fact
Or you might say: "Our fathers had incorporated with Allah other deities, and as their descendents, they have had much influence on our thoughts; will You O Allah subject us to the torment to pay a debt owed to You by the damned
Thus do We expound Our revelations and render Our discourse readily understood so that they may hopefully he dutiful to Allah
And narrate to the Jews O Muhammad the story of the Israelite to whom We imparted intellectual acquaintance with all the facts and We vested him with the power of comprehending Our signs. Yet he blinded his mind's eyes and refrained from proceeding with Our purpose. By consequence, We sent him to the Devil who had led him by the nose to the maze of error
Had We willed We Would have opened his heart's ears and influenced him with the divine course of action, and thereby exalted his best faculties to the highest spiritual honours. But he chose to direct his intellect earthward, indulge in vanities and remain low. And there, he stood similitude exact of the dog which lolls his tongue whether you drive him away or you let him alone. This is exactly the similitude of those who deny Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority. Therefore, recourse O Muhammad to the narratives of such persons so that they may hopefully pause to think
Evil indeed is the similitude of those who denied Our signs and refused to recognize Our revelations and were unreasonable and unjust to themselves
Indeed he whom Allah guides to His path of righteousness is he who is guided by the spirit of truth into all truth, and those whom Allah does not guide to his path of righteousness are they who are born to be losers
We have disposed to the abode in Hell many of the Jinn and mankind whom We had foreknown to be losers; they carry hearts stigmatized with dullness of comprehension and eyes lacking perception and they have no ears for admonition. These are they standing similitude exact of cattle, in fact even worse, and these are the heedless of all truth
To Allah belong all the Commendable attributes you people may use when invoking Him under any circumstance, and disregard those who use them profanely. They shall be requited with what is commensurate with their profanity
Among those whom We have brought into being, a people who seek unto Allah: they guide others into all truth which they interpret in thoughts and in deeds and in implementing the general principles of justice
And those who denied Our revelations and signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority, shall cast themselves headlong to Hell. We shall give them plenty of rope to allow them free scope, so that unawares to themselves, they shall commit themselves to evil
I give them respite and delay My action, but My scheme of action is decisive, conclusive, strict and unfailing; it strikes at the root
Do the infidels not pause to think of their fellow - citizen and countryman* and his disposition, and weigh the matter mentally, give it due weight, and honestly admit that he is not possessed by an evil spirit nor is there a demoniac element in him. He is but a spectacle and a warning who stands manifest of moral and spiritual sublimity
Do they not see into the immensity of the universe and look with their minds' eyes at the realms of the heavens and the earth and the precision with which structures are related and at the unique government of all that He has created! Do they not ponder that the end of their term of life may well be approaching! Therefore, if they refuse to acknowledge the truth as is featured in these signs, what then will convince them if these signs and this divine discourse do not
He whom Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness shall find no one to guide him thereto. He gives him and such person plenty of rope to allow them free scope and action in order to commit themselves to the loss in the maze of error
The infidels insolently call upon you O Muhammad for information relative to the point of time at which the predetermined Eventful Hour of Judgment takes place! Say to them: " it is only Allah alone Who knows when, He alone has the rightful claim to the knowledge of the how and when of here and Hereafter; no one reveals it when due but Him as His word prompts". "It weighs quite heavily on the heavens and all those within and on the earth and the hopes of all those therein, and the encounter with it is simply a sudden start of a surprise". They ask you about it as if you are anxious to know the how and when and as a result you have been informed. Say to them: " Rest assured that it is only Allah alone Who does know when, but most people do not realize this fact
Say to them O Muhammad: "I have no control over what will become nor of what will befall me, be it good or bad but as Allah wills. He is the Principle Power by Whom events are unalterably predetermined". "If I indulged in prophecy and were able to foretell future events and realize the unseen I would have made all grace abound in me, and never would I have failed to be out of harm's way". "I am only a spectacle and a warning to people whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
He is it Who brought you into being from one single soul -Adam- and from him, by a special creation, did He evolve his mate in whom he seeks consolation and finds comfort. And when he -the early man- approached her with amorous intention, she conceived and the pregnancy passed unnoticed in its early stages. But as the ovum became an embryo and the embryo developed into a foetus which grew larger and the mother grew heavier, the parents invoked the deity's mercy and blessings interpreting their thoughts in words "If You ", they said, "give us a healthy child free from abnormalities and malformations, we will most certainly be grateful
And when Allah Himself did, they ascribed to Him other deities, with whom they incorporated. Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely far beyond all those they incorporate with Him
Is it befitting that they incorporate with Him any created being, animate or Inanimate, who is infinitely incapable of creating a living being nor one. Of the simple Constituents of which all material bodies are compounded, when all in all has Allah brought into being and caused to exist
Nor can these objects of worship afford them help or help themselves
And if you idolaters invoke them to offer you counsel they shall not respond whether your invocatory prayer is expressed in words or in thought
You had better realize, O you people that those whom you invoke besides Allah are created beings like yourselves; therefore, invoke them and see if they respond if you truly believe that you are declaring the truth
Do they have feet to go or hands to hold, or do they have eyes to see or ears to hear; they have neither the special faculties to perceive external objects nor the faculties of mind or soul, understanding or intelligence as bearing on action, behaviour or judgement. Say to them O Muhammad: "Call on your predominant partners who have authority over you besides Allah and let them devise their plan of unfavourable action against me and conduct it to conclusion, and give me no respite
My tutelary guardian is Allah Who has revealed the Book, the Quran, the fountain-head of divine knowledge, wisdom and justice. He is the tutelary Protector of those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
Whereas those whom you invoke besides Him shall fail forever to afford you help or help themselves
And if you should invoke them to offer you counsel they cannot hear you, and you can see their artificial eyes staring vacantly at you, unable to see
Be indulgent O Muhammad and favour forbearance anti relaxation of restraint, and make due allowances and enjoin conformity of life and conduct to the requirements of morality disregarding the impudent who are insolently disrespectful
And if AL-Shaytan entices you by suggesting divergence or discord secretly to your mind, do not consent nor be actuated, but commit yourself to Allah counter to the evil he instigated. Allah is indeed Sami'un (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition, and 'Alimun (Omniscient)
Those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, always bear Allah in mind to the extent that if and when a satanic touch of evil is suggested secretly to their minds, they immediately bring religion into touch with conduct and lift to Allah their inward sight
Yet the satanic among the Jinn and mankind keep driving divergence by dint of repetition into the infidels' heads and simply lead the way
And if you do not present them with a supernatural act to satisfy their desire, they wish you would go in quest of it. Say to them: I only follow what is revealed to me by spiritual influence from Allah, my Creator; this is the Quran, the true illumination and enlightenment. It is revealed by Allah, your Creator, to open your mind's eyes and guide those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand into all truth and to confer on them Allah's mercy and blessings
O you people who have conformed to Islam: When the Quran is recited, bow down your ears and listen graciously and attentively to it so that you may hopefully be recipients of Allah's mercy
And bear Allah, your Creator, in your inmost thoughts and secret feelings so that the principle of thought and action, the soul, exercises devotional contemplation with humbleness and profound reverence and with bated breath at the beginning and the end of the day. Let not your innermost being be unmindful of Allah
Indeed, those in heaven's realm who are in the August presence of Allah, your Creator, are not too proud to adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; they praise Him and extoll His glorious attributes and prostrate themselves to Him in veneration
They ask you O Muhammad about the spoils of war what to do with them, to whom do they belong and how are they going to be divided among the victors! Say to them: "They belong to Allah and His cause and to the Messenger who administers Allah's affairs according to divine instructions. The main thing is that you people entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and to stand firm to Allah's principles and purpose, to concert all matters in difference and to obey Allah and His Messenger if indeed your hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Those whose innermost thoughts and secret feelings are indeed purposed to serve Allah are they whose innermost being is inspired with reverential wonder combined with latent fear at the thought of Allah. When His revelations are recited to them, their force of reason becomes stronger and more powerful and in Allah they trust
It is they who faithfully observe their act of worship and spend in divine service of what Allah has apportioned to them of His bounty
These are the true believers whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues; they are classified according to grades of rank and quality, grades of honour commensurate with their deeds in addition to forgiveness and gracefully blessed provisions
The spoils of war precipitated diversity of opinion, exactly as did your contemplated expedition when Allah, your Creator, induced you O Muhammad to leave your home on a mission of truth authorizing war of belief against disbelief . Some of those who conformed to Islam did not have fighting in their minds and were hesitant to join battle, declaring their aversion
Contending with you with opposing arguments after it had been made clear to them that victory would sit on their helm. Yet they behaved as if they would be driven to death being shaped to them in their minds' eyes as a monstrous apparition
Allah has promised you victory over one of the two organized parties. Some of your people chose to seize the unarmed caravan for easy gains, whereas Allah has willed that you go at the organized well armed troops which came to their aid, so that truth should triumph over falsehood and His words be verified as He uproots the infidels
And as such, shall Allah vindicate the truth and blot out falsehood, offensive as it may be to those sinful idolaters
You implored Allah's aid with touching entreaties and Allah responded favourably, thus: "I will", He said: "uphold you with one thousand angels in sets succeeding one another
We voiced this spiritual support to give you people mental comfort and joyful tidings and make your hearts return to their settled calmness, Indeed, victory comes only by the help of Allah Who is AL-Aziz (the Almighty), and Hakimun (Wise)
And there did Allah replace the emotion of sorrow and grief which was caused by fear of the unpredictable outcome by peace of mind and sense of security thus inducing your eyes to take themselves to slumber. He sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain - water to free you people from foreign matter as well as from moral and spiritual pollution and from the incitement of evil instigated by AL-Shaytan (Satan) and by those with characteristics befitting Him, and to do your hearts good and set your feet firm
There and then did Allah, your Creator, inspire the angels. Thus: " I am acting with you", Allah said: "and so support the cause of those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and sustain them spiritually and help them take a firm position and set their feet firm". "I will inspire terror", Allah added, "in the hearts of those who are given to disbelief; strike them above the necks and strike their finger tips, their weak limbs and their failing joints
This train of events succeeding one another were occasioned on account of their hostility to Allah and to His Messenger; and he who is hostile to Allah and His Messenger shall realize that Allah punishes severely indeed
This is it you infidels, but that is not all; there awaits you the torment to be laid on the damned
O you who have conformed to Islam: "If you happen to meet with the infidels -the enemy to your faith- and you see they are marshaled for fighting you, do not turn your backs upon them nor reverse your course or retreat
And he who turns his back, reverses his course or retreats, unless it be a stratagem for gaining advantage over the enemy or for falling back on other troops projected and directed as the larger military movement and operation of the campaign, will have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and be destined to the abode in Hell, and how evil is the destination
You people must realize that it was not you who brought death upon the infidels but it was Allah Who destroyed them. It was not you O Muhammad who aimed when you spattered, but it was Allah Who directed the sand you hurled at your enemy. Nor was it you who deprived them of power when you threw the handful of sand at their faces, but it was Allah Who eclipsed their sight. Nonetheless, Allah has determined to test the quality of those who have conformed to Islam with gracious intentions; on the one hand with His prevenient grace producing the repentance and faith without which the grace of justification cannot be received and on the other hand with the efficacious grace really effecting the end for which it is given; Allah is indeed Sami'un (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition and 'Alimun (Omniscient)
And so, this is it. Meantime Allah defies the infidels; He suspends their volition and renders their stratagem inefficient
And you infidels, if you were looking for victory and judgement; your hopes have been doomed to disappointment; the Ka'ba belongs to those who have conformed to Islam. And if you exercise your faculty of volition toward peaceful existence and desist from the hostile course of action and your prudence gets the better of your pride, it would be to your advantage. But if your pride gets the better of your prudence and you resume hostilities, then the two sides shall inevitably meet again. And your troops, multitudinous as they will be, shall be of no advantage to you, for Allah upholds those whose hearts are faithful to Him
O you who have conformed to Islam: Obey Allah and His Messenger and never withdraw from his presence when you are listening to his discourse on practical divinity
Nor permit yourselves to be like those -the hypocrites- who pretended to have listened faithfully to the truth and pretended to abide by it when in fact they counselled deaf and closed their hearts' ears to discourses on practical divinity; there is speed in their dumbness
Indeed, the worst creatures in Allah's sight are the deaf and dumb who are unwilling to hear nor heed
Had Allah found in them any good He would have opened their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and made their prudence get the better of their pride. And if He did, they would have turned away and counselled deaf to the spirit of truth that guides into all truth
O you who have conformed to Islam: Respond favourably to Allah's commands and to the admonition by His Messenger when he invites you to lead a life that deserves the name, a life that is based on clean hearts and on divine knowledge and on denunciation of evil and ignorance and superstitions of later times. A life that is based on the faculty or sum of faculties of the mind or the soul by which one knows and reasons and exercises the power of thought and understanding. Life based on freedom from idolatry to the inanimate and the animate and on worshipping and obeying the One and Only -the Creator of the universe- Who gives life and occasions death. A life that is based on the quality of mind showing itself in facing danger without fear and based on kindness, compassion, benevolence and on religious and spiritual virtues. A life that is productive and fulfilling the normal purpose, so that it be meaningful, honourable and worth living. And you people had better realize that Allah intervenes between man and his heart to love or hate, to open its ears or counsel deaf, to be courageous or wanting courage, to be kind, or hard, to beat or fail and stop, and to Him shall all of you be thronged
And avoid dissension, temptation and discord which may be brewed by some and practiced by others. The fatal consequence does not fall only on the wrongful but it unites all of you, and you must realize that Allah punishes severely
Remember, you were some few viewed with contempt, living in fear of persecution, abduction and exile, and Allah put you under His tutelage, gave you shelter and made you strong in influence and authority and gave you security of position and reinforced you by His additional support and made victory sit on your helm. He provided you with victuals of the various good and wholesome kinds hoping you would impel yourselves to gratitude and gratefulness
O you who have conformed to Islam : Do not prove false to the trust nor to Allah and His Messenger Who trusted you nor knowingly misappropriate anything that has been entrusted to you
And you must realize that your wealth and your progeny are but a temptation and a means of trial to test your spiritual and moral attributes, your accomplishments and attainments as well as your course of actions. Do not forget that in Allah's realm you obtain the ultimate of your desires
O you who have conformed to Islam: If you entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, He will confer on your souls the faculty of knowing and reasoning, of thought and understanding, so that you can perceive the difference between right and wrong, have the capacity to discriminate one individual from another and constitute a difference between the powers of good and evil to the end that He blots out your iniquities. He is the source of sufficient grace abounding in whom He will and of efficacious grace which really effects the end for which it is given
And remember O Muhammad how the infidels, with cleverness in circumventing, had recourse to stratagem tending to take you as prisoners and keep you in bondage or kill you, and in His plan did Allah also have recourse to stratagem, and who can gain advantage on Allah
When Our revelations are recited to them. They insolently say: "We have heard, and the like of this we heard before, and if we will we could discourse the like thereof. This is nothing but fables of old
And remember O Muhammad when their pride and insolence got the better of their prudence and they said: O Allah, "if this is a divine discourse revealed from Your heaven's realm, then pour down upon us from the floor of the vault of heaven a rain of stones or a rain of large blows
But Allah was not going to rain on them large blows while you are in their midst, nor was He going to put them to the torment before giving them plenty of rope to allow them free scope so that they either commit themselves and deserve annihilation or be sober minded, stand repentant and invoke Allah's forgiveness
What excuse can they offer now to justify their wrongful deeds and bar prosecution! Therefore there is no reason why Allah should make them suffer for their offense. They have abused the act of grace and fallen from grace. They malevolently obstructed the way to the Sacrosanct House when they are not its guardians. Its guardians are those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah but most of these do not realize this fact
Their prayer at the Sacrosanct House was simply featured in whistling and applause. Therefore, you infidels have well deserved to be put to the torment in requital of infidelity
These infidels spend their money in the warring campaigns of disbelief against belief with the motive principle of obstructing the way to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness. They shall spend until they exhaust themselves and suffer losses, and then lament the events and circumstances with sighing. Then shall reason conquer passion and they lose the field and be subdued, and all infidels shall be thronged into Hell
Such an amount of money spent in the war of disbelief against belief brings the two opposing sides into contact. There and then does Allah distinguish those who prevail upon themselves to serve Him and expose those who perform half - heartedly and those croakers who are always boding their ruin, He sums up the evidence of all evil and adds it together and casts all who have an evil savour in their composition into Hell; these are they who were born to be losers
Tell O Muhammad these infidels: if they are willing to renounce infidelity, desist from evil purpose and turn to Allah, they will be forgiven their past iniquities. But should they resume hostilities and persist in their intentional assertion of falsehood, then suffice it to say that Allah's mode of action pursued in the past for each typical instance of punishment shah not alter
So conditioned, then, fight against them the good fight of faith until persecution comes to an end and concord replaces discord and Allah's system of faith and worship prevails, and people take upon themselves: The recognition of Allah and His control of destiny, His rightful claim to obedience, reverence and worship, and the general mental and moral attitude resulting from this belief and its effect upon the individual and the people at large. If they desist and turn to Allah, He certainly is Bassirun(graceful and kind to his servants), He sees all that they do
But if they refuse and counsel deaf, then you Muslims must realize that Allah is your tutelary Guardian and how Ultimate in excellence is the Protector, and the Ultimate of ultimate to afford help
And you Muslims must realize that whatever you capture from your enemy in the way of spoils of war, comes under Allah's Authority. One fifth is assigned to Allah and His Messenger, to the kindred and to the orphans and the needy, that is if the heart of your purpose is indeed Allah's purpose and you have exercised your minds in thought and contemplation conferred on Our Messenger and on your souls to vindicate the powers of good and beat down the powers of evil when the two forces met, and Allah is Qadirun over all things; He overrules personal aims
You were on the near side of the valley and the infidels on the far side, and the caravan below you marching by; a web of circumstance calculated and timely arranged by the Omnipotent. Had you tried to plan such a precise arrangement you would have failed. Allah had planned it in such a manner as to serve His purpose and to help you obtain an advantage over your enemy who outnumbered you to a great disproportion, the survivors among the infidels will then realize that their defeat was made by Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and the survivors among the Muslim victors realize Allah's Omnipotence and Sovereignty and Allah is indeed Sami'un with unlimited audition and 'Alimun
Allah O Muhammad -in His infinite mercy has presented to your mind in your sleep the troops of the infidels as being some few- at the psychologically appropriate moment in which your minds were in actual expectation of war to happen. Had He presented them to you in your vision as being multitudinous you would have been smitten with mental anguish and dismay and you would have fallen into dispute, but Allah saved the situation; He is 'Alimun of all that is brewed secretly in the breasts
When the two forces met, We influenced your minds' eyes so as you view them as being some few, and you would be viewed as being some few, so that you assail each other, and Allah's purpose would be served as has been enacted, and to Allah, the Ultimate Authority are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and Hereafter
O you who have conformed to Islam: When you come upon an encounter with a troop of your enemies; do-not waver, but be resolute and firm, and think of Allah and call Him to mind as often as you can so that Heaven may help you gain the upper hand
Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not contend with each other with opposing arguments lest your hopes should be doomed to disappointment and you lose heart, and the wind be taken out of your sails. Have patience and remember that Allah upholds the patient
And be not like those* who left their homes -for battle- displaying deliberately and ostentatiously their might in order to, attract notice, win admiration and warn others; they aimed at obstructing the way to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness, but Allah is Omniscient of all that they do
They were befooled by AL-Shaytan and those with characteristics befitting him who allured them to brighter worlds as a logical result and sequence to their doings and led the way. "Rest assured ", AL-Shaytan said, " that no man can overpower you today in battle and I will be by your side". But when the two forces met** he turned on his heels and reversed his position declaring his innocence of their ills, and said: "I see with my mind's eyes what you cannot see; I fear Allah Whose torment is laid upon the damned
There and then said those in whose hearts reigned vice, the hypocrites and those with ill-natured hearts- thus: "How foolish the Muslims are to challenge such a large force; they are befooled by their religion which induced them to attack a great and superior force!". But he who puts his trust in Allah, shall find Allah 'Azizun and Hakimun
If you could only see the infidels when the angels of death besiege them all about to disembody their souls, how they descend violently upon them striking their faces and their backs, and say to them: " Now you shall taste the torment of the Fire laid upon the damned
This is in the train of the evil deeds your wrongful and unclean have committed, and Allah is not unjust to His servants
These peoples' disposition and attitude of mind do not differ from those of the Pharaoh and his people and their predecessors; they denied Allah and rejected His signs and revelations; so great was Allah's indignation against them for their wickedness that He took them by storm. Allah is indeed Qawiyun (Omnipotent); His torment is laid upon the damned
This reasoning is based on Allah's justified course of action adopted as an expedient. He never withdraws nor changes His merited or unmerited favour He graced a given nation with until they change their own minds' attitude and the disposition of their innermost being, Allah is indeed Sami'un (with unlimited audition), and 'Alimun
A reasoning marked by circumspection: it is attentive to all circumstances that may affect action, circumstances that are similar to those of the Pharaoh and his people and their predecessors who were united in their innate quality. They abused Allah's grace and by consequence fell from grace; they denied Allah's signs and revelations and persisted in their intentional assertion of falsehood. As a result, We destroyed them in requital of their willful violation of the divine law and their transgression against Allah and His commands. We drowned Pharaoh and his People; they were all wrongful of actions
Indeed, the worst creatures in Allah's sight are those whose hearts' ears are closed and whose minds' eyes are blind, who counsel deaf to divine discourse and disavow Allah
Who concluded with you O Muhammad a truce and resolved to cause a discord to pass into a concord, yet they break every agreement contracted for amity and peace, and never do they entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
Therefore, whenever and wherever you Muslims meet them in an active hostile contention, reduce them into a useless form to set an example of their humiliation serving as a deterrent to those who attempt thereafter to war against you
Should you suspect treachery on the part of a people with whom you have concluded a peace treaty, let them know that you have cancelled your vow just the same; Allah detests indeed the treacherous
And those infidels who deny Allah must realize that they have not escaped His divine attributes of Prescience and Omniscience nor shall they deter Him from afflicting them with a retributive punishment
And prepare for them you Muslims all you can recruit of strength: armed forces and mounted troops- to strike terror into the hearts and minds of Allah's enemy who is your enemy, and into the hearts and minds of others whom you do not know but Allah knows them. And remember that whatever you spend in divine service you shall be reimbursed and never shall you be wronged
If they incline to reconcile themselves with their own hearts and with Allah and make peace, then be willing to incline thereto, and put your trust in Allah; He is AL-Sami' (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition, and AL-'Alim
And if this happens to be an instance of deception and they mean to disappoint your expectation of peace, then good enough for you is Allah to count upon for support; He is it Who upheld your cause and crowned you with victory with His aid and with those who have conformed to Islam
And it is He Who united their feeling and thought, their action and interest and their purpose, and caused their spiritual union with Allah. It is He Who made them reconcile themselves with their own hearts and with Allah. Had you spent all the available wealth on earth for this purpose, you would have failed to tune their hearts to one thought. But Allah brought this unison by tuning their frame of mind, their mood and their disposition; Allah is indeed Azizun and Hakimun
O you the Prophet: Sufficient for you, and for those Muslims who fell into line with you, is Allah Who upholds your cause and helps you accomplish your divine purpose
O you the Prophet: Urge the Muslims to action; twenty of you exercising patience and standing firm shall vanquish two hundred, and if there are a hundred of such a caliber, they shall defeat a thousand of the infidels who are fighting against the truth because they are characterized with dullness of comprehension
Now that the powers of good have defeated the powers of evil and Allah, being aware of your poor physical strength, has commuted your obligation due to Him. If there are a hundred of you who exercise patience and stand firm, they shall vanquish two hundred, and if there are one thousand, they shall vanquish two thousand, Allah willing, Allah upholds the patient
No Prophet is entitled to take prisoners of war under the circumstances when the infidels are doing their best to defy Allah's religion, until he has humbled the avowed enemies of faith and subdued the land at the peril of their lives. To take prisoners and ransom them at this stage means that you Muslims are concerned with the interests and pleasures of this life when Allah's concern is the Hereafter, and Allah is Azizun and Hakimun
Had it not been for Allah's authoritative decree proclaimed beforehand to forgive a votary who inadvertently errs, you people would have been severely punished for what you have undertaken
Therefore, you may enjoy what you have gained, in the way of spoils of war, it is a lawful gain, but fear Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
O you the Prophet, say to those of the captives upon your hands: If Allah finds in your hearts a zeal to promote the common good, we will compensate to you more than what you have lost and give up resentment against you and pardon your offense; Allah is Ghafurun (Forgiving), and Rahimun
And if they intend to betray you and disappoint your expectations, they have betrayed Allah's cause before, but Allah gave you power to subdue them at their peril, and Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun
Those who conformed to Islam and emigrated to where they could best serve Allah and strove in His cause with their wealth and their lives, and those who gave them refuge and afforded them help, are joined one to the other in mutual intimacy. Those who conformed to Islam but due to social or business interests did not emigrate to where they could best serve Allah will be denied your tutelary protection until they have emigrated. But if they seek your aid against persecution directed against them by their people for holding Allah's religious system, then it is incumbent on you to help them, unless you happen to have concluded with their people a treaty of mutual alliance, Allah is Bassirun (Omnipresent) He sees all that you do
These infidels who deny Allah are joined one to another in mutual intimacy and afford one another mutual help, and unless you Muslims do the same, then discord shall replace concord and the world shall be given to great mischief and perversion of integrity
And those who conformed to Islam and emigrated to where they could best serve Allah, and strove in His cause with their wealth and their lives, as well as those who gave them refuge and afforded them help, are the recipients of Allah's blessings. These are indeed the faithful who are conscientious in the fulfillment of their duty to Allah, they shall be graced with forgiveness and blessed provisions
And those who have since conformed to Islam and emigrated at a later date and fought in the cause of Allah by your side, constitute an integral part of you and enjoy the same rights. Now that the stability of the faith has been ensured then those who are related by blood do have prior rights toward each other as is decreed in the archetypal Book of Allah; Allah is indeed 'Alimun of the whole and of all in all
Allah and His Messenger declare explicitly that the obligation made between you Muslims and the idolaters who break their vows is, as of today, rendered void
Nonetheless, you infidels, worshippers of idols, may move freely in the land, if you will, and as, you please. You will be well secured against all assaults for a period of four months. But you must realize that you shall not defeat Allah's purpose nor can you escape His sure watch. He is Omnipresent with unlimited audition, Omniscient of all those whose purpose is to defy His cause, He shall disgrace them and put to shame
On the day of the great occasion of AL-Hajj (major pilgrimag)
But exempt from this immediate liability, are those of the Pagans with whom you Muslims have concluded a peace treaty they have honoured and for the mean time refrained from helping others against you. It is incumbent on you to fulfill your obligation to them until they have reached the end of the term of security. Allah likes those who obey Him and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
When the four Sacred Months of grace have expired, then kill the vicious idolaters wherever you find them, seize them besiege them and lie down for them in ambush everywhere. But should they repent, engage in the act of worship and give Zakat (alms), then leave them alone; Allah is Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
If anyone of the Pagans seeks your protection O Muhammad, then protect him and grant him asylum; he may open his heart's ears to Allah's discourse. Escort him to where he will be out of harm's way. They are people deficient in sense and intelligence; they are simpletons
You must realize O Muslims that these treacherous Pagans place before themselves one thing to be attained, that is to divert your minds from righteousness and uprightness and suppress Allah's system of faith. Therefore, how could they honour their vow or treaty with Allah and with His Messenger; they only conclude with you a treaty as a stratagem to obtain an advantage. Yet you must honour your obligation to those of them with whom you concluded a treaty at the Sacrosanct Mosque. As long as they honour their part you will have to honour yours. Allah likes those who obey Him and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
So conditioned, how can these Pagans impel themselves to the sense of feelings and good disposition toward you people when they entertain evil thoughts of you! If they get an advantage over you and prevail against you they shall reduce you to a useless form disregarding totally the ties of kinship as well as their obligations. They put in words the sweet discourse which gratifies you while their hearts bode ill, and most of them are indeed wicked
These people have exchanged the truth of Allah's revelations and His Messenger's mission for the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world and obstructed the way to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness. Evil indeed is what their minds and their souls have impelled them to do
If they get an advantage over a Muslim and prevail against him, they shall injure him, disregarding totally their ties of kinship and their obligations. Their disposition reflects their transgressive infirmities. They prevail themselves of what the occasion gives
If they in lowliest plight repentant stood performed regular prayer and imprinted their deeds with wisdom and piety and gave Zakat, then they are your Co-religionists and an integral part of your brotherhood. We expound Our revelations and render Our discourse readily understood to people who reflect
But should they infringe their oaths after they have pledged their vows to you, and assailed your religion with opprobrious or abusive language, then you must battle against the ring-leaders of bigotry whose professed system of faith is featured in idolatry and infidelity, for then they will have proved themselves of a faithless disposition, false to the vows. They may with such calculated punishment desist, for their own sake, from their hostile course of action
These Pagans were they who almost always broke their vows and disregarded their treaties, they purposed to oust the Messenger from Macca and plotted to turn him out of Madina and they were the aggressors following the covenant into which both of you entered*. Therefore, would you not take these matters of fact as have been narrated to you and circumstance them after the right manner or do you fear them, when it is Allah whom you should fear if indeed you have conformed to His system of faith and worship
Fight them the good fight of faith; Allah intends to make them suffer at your hands and put them to shame, and make fortune and victory sit on your helm. A victory intended to heal the ill confined in the bosoms of the faithful and pour balm into the festering wounds of their hearts and minds
To free their hearts from inveterate anger and their uneasy minds from soreness, and to return them to their settled calm. Allah gives up resentment against whom He will and pardons his offence, He is 'Alimun (Omniscient), and Hakimun (Wis)
Did you think O Muslims that you would be left untested and untampered or be left in peace before Allah has yet to see: that you have distinguished yourselves on every front or line of battle, that you have been distinguished as the valiant and the patient who are unwearied in the face of difficulties and undisturbed by good or ill fortune and that you have ground for sustaining your tutelage under no one besides Allah, His Messenger and your co-religionists; Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do
It is never becoming nor is it consistent for the idolaters to attend the mosques of Allah bearing witness within themselves of their infidelity and the denial of Allah. These are they whose hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness here and Hereafter, and in Hell shall they have passed through nature to eternal suffering
Indeed, the only people qualified to attend the mosques of Allah are those who faithfully believe in Him and in Day of Judgment, with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, who engage in the act of worship and give Zakat, for zakat is but the vehicle of prayer, and fear no one but Allah. Such persons are hopefully expected to be among those who have resolved to attain no other way but the way to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness
Do you Pagans wish to make quenching the thirst of the pilgrims and attending the Mosque equal with the mental consent to Allah on the ground of evidence and the belief in the truth of the Day of Judgment in addition to the ardour in the pursuit of the cause of Allah! Such duties as viewed by Him are not to be compared. Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness the wrongful of actions
Indeed, those who conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship and emigrated to where they could best serve Him and strove in His cause with their wealth and their lives are privileged by Allah with distinction in the scale of dignity and rank, and these are the triumphant who are bound to His care
Their endeavour in Allah's cause has occasioned His gratification; He takes pleasure in announcing to them His mercy and blessings, His satisfaction and His heavenly gardens of supreme bliss wherein they shall have passed through nature to Eternity
Their stay, in terms of state, is that of bliss, and in terms of time, is that vast; forever, and in heaven's realm does Allah have excellent rewards
O you who have conformed to Islam: Do not favour the tutelage of your fathers nor of your sons if they prefer infidelity to Allah's system of faith and worship, and he who takes them as tutelary friends, protectors or guardians shall he and such persons be wrongful of actions
Say O Muhammad to those who have conformed to Islam: "If your fathers and your sons, your brothers and your wives your kindred and the wealth you have acquired, your trade which you fear may stagnate or decline and the comfortable and attractive homes, are regarded with more esteem and affection than Allah and His Messenger and than fighting the good fight of faith, then you just wait until Allah's fitting judgement presents itself. Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness the wrongful of actions
Allah has helped you win victory in many battles of belief against disbelief, and on the day of the battle of Hunain when you presumed upon the great superiority of your numbers but it availed you nothing and the earth, vast as it is, seemed, due to lack of discipline and the ambition of the worldly minded among you, drawn together and constricted, then you shrank from danger and sought safety in flight
There and then did Allah inspire peace and tranquility as well as just confidence to the hearts and minds of His Messenger and of the faithful troops, and He sent down an invisible array of angels to assail your enemies and put them to rout, and there, He inflicted them with punishment in requital of their infidelity
Yet, thereafter does Allah give up resentment against whom He will and pardons his offence, for Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
O you who have conformed to Islam; the idolaters are impure spiritually and physically. Accordingly, they must not be allowed near the Sacrosanct Mosque after this year*. Should you fear scarcity as a result of breakage of commercial relations; Allah shall make His grace abound in you, if He will; He is indeed 'Alimun and Hakimun
Fight those who deny Allah and the Day of judgement among Ahl AL-Kitab (people of the Book); they do not exclude what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor do they conform to Allah's system of faith and worship, the system of divine truth. Fight them the good fight of faith until they pay tribute in acknowledgement of submission (to supply revenue -like the Muslims- so the State)
The Jews distinguished Ezra -O Zair-* they called him the son of Allah and the Christians called the Messiah, son of Mary, the son of Allah; a fable resembling the falsehood fabled about Allah by those infidels who preceded them. Allah condemns them in as much as they are worth and afflicts them with such evils as indicate a malignant fate. How strongly deluded they are so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true
They took their Rabbins and their monks as well as the AL- Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), as tutelary Masters besides Allah, yet they have been commanded to worship but One Allah, the only Ilah there is. Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is far beyond all those they incorporate with Him
With all the feeling in their minds directed toward falsifying the truth, they wish they could quench the very light of Allah by word of mouth, that is by propagating false rumours and uttering error against Him. But Allah is not moved by undue influence; He continues to make His way unrestrained to send His illumination -the Quran- proceeding from Him, until the souls have been lit by divine truth, and enlightenment has prevailed, albeit this be hateful to those who refuse to acknowledge the truth
He is it Who has sent His Messenger with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and with the true system of faith and worship featured in the Quran, the Criterion and the cannon wherein Providence is the guide. It aligns the course of actions of thought and of life of all concerned, Muslims and Non- Muslims whose religious practices are contingent on man- made related aspects of the one religion whose unclouded and authoritative front is Islam; albeit this is hateful to those who incorporate with Allah other deities
O you people whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: Many of the Rabbins and the Monks do wrongfully eat the people out of their property*, and obstruct the way to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness. Those who treasure up gold and silver and do not spend of it in divine service were born to be losers; announce to them O Muhammad the anticipation of a grievous punishment
One day shall these precious metals be melted by the heat of the Fire of Hell and their foreheads, their sides and their backs be branded therewith. There and then shall they be told: "This is what you had treasured up and cherished; benevolence occasioned to you so much discontent that you denied the poor at their need. Now, you taste the torment which is laid on the damned in requital of hoarding up money and cheating the poor of their due and Allah of divine service
The calendar introduced by Allah when He created the universe -the heavens and the earth- determines the month as the space of time from one new moon to the next, corresponding to the period of one complete revolution of the moon in reference to a point, faxed or movable, and divides the year accordingly into twelve revolutions or months, four of which are sacred and exclusively appropriated to some special purpose emblematic of this right and commendable religion. Therefore, do not wrong yourselves during this period of time nor discredit yourselves by word or thought. And fight the idolaters in the whole as they fight you in the whole and do realize that Allah upholds those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
To transpose a sacred month in favour of another month is to add to infidelity. Such a practice, as being adopted by the Pagans, made them sink deeper under the vexation of their minds; they permit it one year and forbid it another year so as to adjust means to ends and arrange them suitably to the number ordained by Allah, a practice that sets them at defiance with Allah in as much as it permits a course of action forbidden by Him. Thus were the Pagans enticed by their deeds of evil and iniquity that allured their minds' eyes and induced them to hug their irreverent conviction to their hearts and were swayed from the path of righteousness. Allah never guides to His path of righteousness the infidels whose aim is to defy Him
O you who have conformed to Islam: what ails you that you are indisposed to action! When you are told to strive in the cause of Allah you cling heavily to the ground! Have you come to be worldly - minded and content with life here afore that Hereafter! But how little are the material and the immaterial things that minister to enjoyment and content here as compared with Hereafter
Unless you respond favourably to the Messenger's call to serve Allah and be moved to action and fight the good fight of faith against disbelief, you will be pained at heart; Allah will afflict you, in His own way, with a condign punishment and replace you by others, and your indisposition to His purpose shall not harm Him in the least; Allah is Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things
If you do not afford him help and assist him in the accomplishment of Allah's purpose, you must realize that Allah graced him with triumph over his enemies -Quraish- who plotted for his life. Prompted by Allah and actuated by divine influence he left home with no one but his companion* to whom he was his second. In the cave** where they both hid, He said to his companion: Rest assured and do not grieve; we are not two but three; Allah is in our presence There and then did Allah inspire peace and tranquility as well as just confidence to the heart and mind of His Messenger and the thoughts were conveyed to one another, and He upheld him and supported him with an invisible array of angels. There, did Allah make what the infidels had forged in their breasts to what their tongues have vented fail to accord. Thus, was what they declared in words debased and the Word of Allah, supreme and dominant, is as always at the top; Allah is Azizun (Almighty) and Hakimun
Move to action and fight the good fight of faith, each in his capacity, lightly armed and heavily armed, infantry and mounted troops men and women, old and young, rich and poor. Every hand must be open to contribute something to the common purpose, and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives, a continuous series of operations constituting the whole. Such a campaign is to your advantage if only you knew. It kills the attempt your enemy has made to shake the dominion Allah intends to establish, it makes the final victory sit on your helm and brings you peace of mind and it helps you prevail and confirm Allah's system of faith and worship
Had the expedition been a short distance and they were confident their march would attain its worldly end, they would have followed you. But the distance disenchanted their minds and appeared toilsome. They will swear to you O Muhammad that they would have gone out with you to fight had they been able to do so. They are the cause of their own destruction, and Allah knows that they are liars
Allah bless you O Muhammad! Why did you grant them permission to be among the stay-at- home before sifting them in action to find out the truthful, and expose those who lie in their teeth
Never shall those who lift to Allah their inward sight and assert the truth of the Hereafter ask you to exempt them from this obligation. They feel they must move to action as ordained by Allah Whose purpose is the heart of their purpose. They purpose to strive in His cause, which is their cause with their wealth and their lives. Allah is fully aware of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
For laboured impiety; what apology can be invented but by those who deny Allah and the Day of Judgement and their deep-rooted doubt affects their hearts and their minds profoundly, and in their objective uncertainty they vacillate
Had they been disposed in mood and mind to obey such advice as Allah inclines them to propound, they would have made all preparations necessary for overpowering the assailant who is quick, skillful and deadly. But being fully aware of their innermost thoughts and of what their breasts forge, Allah disliked their participation in the campaign, and discouraged them and impelled them to the feeling of utter demoralization and it was decided that they join the stay-at-home
Had they joined you in battle, they would have caused discord and hastened to sow dissension, slander and thoughts of sedition among you, And among you are attentive hearers who bow down their ears to them. Allah is 'Alimun of all the wrongful of actions
They made it their aim before truth prevailed to sow thoughts of sedition and discord and the wicked plotted against the just. They deranged your ordinary pursuits of life O Muhammad as well as your divine course of action, hoping you would not prevail and firmly establish Allah's system of faith and worship. But great is truth and it did prevail, and there did Allah's word, as is always expected, assume the top, notwithstanding their opposition and their evil feeling
Among them is he who asks you O Muhammad to exempt him from participating in the expedition lest he succumbs to temptation; He says to you: "Exempt me from this obligation and do not let me fall into temptation". Indeed, into error and impiety, into temptation and turmoil, into insurgency and insurrection of ignorance and into persecution by Heaven have they fallen, and Hell besets the infidels who deny Allah
When good fortune falls in your way, be it through victory or through martyrdom, they come to be actuated with envy and grieved at heart. But if you are befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity, they rejoice beyond a common joy and express their thoughts in words, thus: "With prudent foresight" they say, "we exercised caution beforehand to provide against misfortunes and turmoil", and they turn their backs and go away well pleased
Say to them: Nothing befalls us good fortune or misfortune, victory or martyrdom, defeat or retreat, but has been divinely assessed and justly determined by Allah. He is our tutelary guardian and in Allah should those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust
Say to them: " Do you give yourselves up to the first anticipations of your thoughts! But only one of two things can happen to us, and either of them is but an advantage, martyrdom or victory. As for you, we do anticipate an inevitable retributive punishment either from heaven or at our hands. Therefore, await the event that shall come in due time and we are also waiting
Say to these hypocrites: "You may spend as much as you like, willingly or unwillingly, making great pretences to religion, but never shall your contributions be acknowledged nor be entered on the credit side of your account. You are a people whose wickedness has reached beyond your reach; it has reached the sky
The reason for refusing to acknowledge their contributions is their unforgivable grave offence against Allah; an offence no amount of money can expiate. They deny Allah and His Messenger, they perform their act of worship with an attitude of mind dispirited and despondent and they spend in Allah's service with great disinclination and reluctance
Do not let the splendour of their riches and their progeny excite your emotion by astonishment mingled with bewildered curiosity. Allah intends to make these attributes the cause of their suffering here below, through unrest and anxiety, and their souls shall be disembodied captivated by disbelief
And they insolently made a solemn declaration with an appeal to Allah that they are your co-religionists and therefore a part of you, when in fact together with you they do not make up a whole. They are a people who display ignoble fear in the face of danger, and they think they can avoid exciting your indignation
If they can find a place of refuge or a cave or a hiding place, they will withdraw hastily from your society and fly to it
Among these hypocrites are some who question your integrity in the way you distribute the spoils and Zakat and try to defame you. They disregard Allah's fundamental motive and reason of action and tend to go by their selfish motive principle. If they go share and share alike, they approve their hearts to Allah, and if they do not have a good share in what is distributed, they express their disapprobation and moral condemnation
Had they been satisfied in mind with the divine fundamental assumption forming the basis of a chain of reasoning that guides the Messenger to action and said: "so be it, we are contented with Allah; His bounty will abound in us directly and through His Messenger and to Him we do homage and suit", it would have been to their advantage
(Zakat is but a vehicle of prayers; it is due only to:a) The poor who are destitute of means of livelihood andb) The needy who are in temporary distress due to sickness, disability or the like.c) Those who are engaged as collectors and administrators thereof andd) Those who have just reconciled themselves with their own hearts and with Allah,e) Those in bondage -who are eager to buy their freedom-f) Those in debt -who are genuinely unable to pay what is owed to others-g) The support of the cause of Allah andh) And the wayfarer -who does not have the means for transportation and has to travel on foot.This is an obligation incumbent on Muslims and dutiful to Allah
Among these hypocrites are also those who prejudice the Prophet and label him: "all ears". "He attentively listens to all that is being said, be it false or true; he is easily deceived". Say to them: "He bows down his ear and listens graciously to all that is of advantage to you"; he believes those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand and he is not deceived by those whom he perceives are lying". "He solemnly believes in Allah and trusts those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand for whom he is Allah's given mercy". Indeed those who prejudice the Prophet shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned
They are reluctant to join you in battle and offer you some excuse and affirm it by an appeal to Allah so that you accept it, when it is Allah and His Messenger that they should conciliate by fighting in their cause if in fact their hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Do they not know that he who sets himself against Allah and His Messenger shall suffer the fire of Hell wherein he will have passed through nature to eternal suffering, and this is indeed disgrace to the extreme
Those hypocrites are subconsciously afraid of being found out, fearing lest a Surah should be revealed betraying their real character and their ill-natured hearts which they wish be kept secret. Say to them: "Hold whom you will in ridicule and laugh him to scorn. Allah shall expose your attributes you have always hoped would be kept secret
And if you should ask them O Muhammad after their real nature has been betrayed, as to why did they plunge into defaming religion and disobeying Allah and His Messenger and laugh them to scorn! They would insolently say: We always plunge into worldly ambition and like to turn matters into a joke. Say to them: Do you make Allah, His revelations and His Messenger the object of a joke and laugh them to scorn
Do not vindicate your grievous wrong now by a prologue and an apology You have turned renegades. If We forgive some of you because of coming back to their senses, We will punish others who are indeed wicked
The hypocrites -men and women- spring from one another and complement each other. They enjoin what is evil and forbid what is just and right. They keep their hands tightly shut, unwilling to spend in divine service and fail to recall Allah to mind and by consequence Allah has neglected them. Indeed the hypocrites are faithless, perverse and morally depraved
Allah has promised the hypocrites the men and the women together with those who deny Him and disregard His authoritative commands the fire of Hell wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering; Hell claims them as her own. Allah has cursed them and they shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned
You hypocrites stand similitude exact of those who preceded you. They were mightier than you are and they lived in greater affluence of wealth and progeny. They enjoyed all that afforded pleasure and was of sensuous character and they neglected all that was dutiful to Allah. Similarly you enjoy all that affords pleasure and is of sensuous character in the same way as those who preceded you; you plunged into worldly ambition the same as they plunged themselves into defaming religion and disobeying Allah. You and such persons are those whose hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness here and Hereafter, and all of you were born to be losers
Have they not been informed of what became of their predecessors -the people of Nuh (Noah) and those of 'Ad, the people of Thamud and those of Ibrahim(Abraham), the people of Shuaib -the Madianites- and those of Lut (Lot) - the subverted cities-. All of them received Messengers who brought them divine illumination and enlightenment. Never was Allah going to do them. injustice, but it was they who wronged themselves
And those of the men and the women whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand are mutual friends; they have a sincere reciprocation of all their kind feelings, they enjoin what is just and right and forbid what is evil, they faithfully and regularly engage in the act of worship and give Zakat; and they obey Allah and His Messenger. These shall Allah have mercy on them and bless their souls. Indeed Allah is Azizun, and Hakimun
Allah has promised the men and the women whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues, blissful gardens in the realm of heaven; gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which flow rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity. Allah has promised them also beautiful mansions in the Gardens of Eden, and above all they come in Allah's grace and win His satisfaction and esteem. This is indeed triumph supreme
O you Prophet: Endeavour vigourously and strive hard against the infidels and the hypocrites and be harsh with them and forbidding. Their abode is Hell, and evil indeed is the destination
They swear to you they never spoke slander against you, when in fact they uttered in a proud and unreserved manner the word emblematic of infidelity, and turned renegades. They meditated mischief featured in their plan to kill you on returning from battle* field, but their attempt upon your life utterly failed. And instead of impelling themselves to gratitude and gratefulness for your presence –in Madina which made Heaven endow them with prosperity, justice and suppression of selfishness; they attempted to avenge Allah's grace by returning evil for good. Nonetheless, if they return to their senses and in lowliest plight repentant stand, it will be to their advantage. But should they turn away and counsel deaf, Allah shall put thorn to the torment here and Hereafter, and no friend on earth nor a protector shall they find
Among them were some whose vows were pledged to Allah that if His grace abounded in them, they would give in benevolence and spend in divine service and be of those whose deeds are printed with wisdom and Piety
And when He bestowed on them of His bounty, their actions to their words did not accord. They were niggardly in divine service and they said to their money "you are my god". They turned away, refusing to heed and turned a deaf ear
By consequence did Allah make hypocrisy go in pursuit of their hearts and overtake their will, their senses and their feelings until the Day they be in His presence and assemble before Him. This is in the train of their wickedness, featured in their disregard of the vows, pledged to Allah, and in their intentional assertion of what is false
Do they not realize that Allah knows what their bosoms store of thoughts and feelings and what they suggest secretly to their minds and all that is not openly avowed! Do they not know that He is well acquainted with their secret counsel and with all that they whisper below their breath and that He is 'Alimun of the seen, the invisible and the unseen
To sink deeper under the vexations of their minds, they spoke maliciously of the rich who consider Zakat is but the vehicle of prayer and consequently give Zakat and do benevolence, and of those who are not rich who contribute their effort or a part of what they earn by labour. They bombarded them with foul epithets and laughed them to scorn. Allah has mocked them and betrayed their wicked attributes and destined them to a condign punishment
You may invoke Allah's forgiveness on their behalf O Muhammad or you may not; it is one and the same. Even if you invoke Allah's forgiveness on their behalf seventy times, never shall He forgive them. They denied Allah and His Messenger and insolently and defiantly disregarded Allah's commands; Allah does not guide the wicked to His path of righteousness
These hypocrites, the stay-at-home, rejoiced for remaining behind, leaving the Messenger and his available troops to set forth for the battle and they hated to participate in the expedition; they disliked greatly to strive with their wealth and their lives and incited others not to join the expedition in the scorching heat of the summer. Say to them: The heat of Hell is far more intense and indeed merciless if only you have enough intelligence to reflect
They may deride; ridicule and laugh the believers to scorn. They shall laugh only for a little but much shall they weep. They shall weep their fill and expend their endless life in Hell in weeping in requital of what their minds and souls had impelled them to do
And if Allah destines you Muhammad to return back safe and secure from battle and the occasion arises for another expedition and any group of these hypocrites ask your permission to join you, you simply refuse and say to them: "Never shall you join me in any expedition nor shall you ever join me in combat or in any military campaign against an enemy. You rejoiced when you remained behind and stayed at home on the first occasion which was indeed crucial, and therefore, you shall again join those who remain behind
Nor should you pray -O Muhammad- for any of them who dies nor observe his funeral or burial rites. These are people who denied Allah and His Messenger and died with minds captivated by wickedness, moral and total depravity
Nor should you let the splendour of their riches and their progeny excite your emotion by astonishment mingled with bewildered curiosity. Allah intends to make these attributes the cause of their suffering here below through unrest and anxiety, and their souls be disembodied captivated by disbelief
And when a Surah is revealed from Heaven enjoining the belief in Allah and commanding action together with His Messenger in His cause you see the able and the affluent among them requesting exemption, saying to you: "Permit us to remain with those remaining behind. The stay-at-home
Satisfied in mind to remain behind with the stay-at-home, they rejoiced beyond a common joy; their hearts have been impressed with dullness of comprehension and therefore they do not apprehend the voice from heaven nor can they be provoked to apprehend virtue
But the Messenger together with those who fell in line with him strove with their wealth and their lives to implement their obligation to Allah Whose purpose is the heart of their purpose. These are the recipients of Allah's grace and of all that is good to attain and it is these whom heaven hall prosper
Allah has prepared for them in His heaven’s realm gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, and this is indeed triumph supreme
Then there came those of the desert Arabs, full of false excuses, to claim exemption, while those of them who apparently conformed to Islam, but deep in heart they deny Allah and His simply sat at home. Those of them who deny Allah and do not submit to His commands shall be put to the torment laid upon the damned
Absolved from warfare are the weak and the sick and those who are indigent lacking the necessities of life. These are excused to stay at home provided they are sincere with Allah and His Messenger, for the sincere shall always find acceptance with Allah These may contribute to the divine cause in their own way if and when they can. Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
Absolved also are those who come to you O Muhammad intending sincerely to join your expedition and you tell them: "I do not have the means to carry you to the battle field" and they weep their fill due to their disappointment. They are grieved at heart over their inability to contribute to Allah's purpose which is the heart of their purpose
But the consequence is indeed incurred on those who are rich and yet they make excuses to claim exemption and do not contribute to Allah's cause. Satisfied in mind, they are pleased to remain behind together with the stay-at- home. Allah has impressed their hearts with dullness of comprehension, and therefore, they do not apprehend the voice from Heaven nor can they be provoked to apprehend virtue. They do not know what is true and by consequence do not know what is good
And when you return back from battle safe and secure, they apologize to you for their offence. Say to them O Muhammad: "Do not offer defensive arguments; we will not believe you; Allah has informed us of your disposition and betrayed your attributes, and Allah and His Messenger shall watch over your innocence and follies, then you shall be sent back to Him Who is 'Alimun of the invisible and of what your bosoms store of thoughts and feelings, and of the visible and the seen and of what is avowed openly and openly disclosed. There and then shall He inform you of what your minds and souls had impelled you to do
They will swear to you with an appeal to Allah when you return to them from battle safe and secure that what they offered you as a reason for claiming exemption was justified; they mean to be exculpated so that you do not censure them or meddle with them with hostile intent. Avoid them O Muhammad and have nothing to do with them. They are morally impure, unhallowed and defiled by sin. Their abode shall be Hell in requital of what their minds and souls have impelled them to do
They swear to you to approve of them because of the kindness of your heart, you must realize that Allah never approves of a people who grow daily more and more wicked
The desert Arabs -Bedouins- are more reprehensible morally and more addicted to infidelity and hypocrisy, they are the most fitted to be ignorant and unaware of the divine statutes and legislative provisions sent down to His Messenger, and Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun
Among these desert Arabs are some who consider spending in the cause of Allah a useless expenditure and a great loss. They pore their thoughts over evil and wish that you Muslims would be befallen with a misfortune or be wedded to a calamity. May Allah afflict them with a disaster and wed them to a calamity; Allah is Sami'un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and 'Alimun
Nonetheless, among these -desert Arabs- are some whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand; they have faith in the doctrine of Islam and they faithfully recognize Allah and acknowledge the truth of the Day of Judgement. They look upon what they spend in His cause as offerings bringing them closer to Him and an inducement to His Messenger to invoke Allah's mercy and blessings on their behalf, for the invocatory prayer of the Messenger is indeed a great offering bringing them closer to Allah. He will admit their claim to His blessings and extend to them His mercy; Allah is indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun
And the van of those who forsook their homes and emigrated with the Messenger, those who welcomed them and gave them aid and those who followed their example, are the recipients of Allah's blessings. Allah has been gracious to them. He is well pleased with them and they with Him. He has prepared for them gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, and this is triumph supreme
Some of the desert Arabs round about you, and of the a Madinite are hypocrites; to all of them hypocrisy is a way of life. They conceal their disposition and cleverly hide their nature from apprehension, you do not recognized them, but We do know them. We will make them suffer double, then be sent back to the torment laid upon the damned
There are others who have confessed their faults; there is much good in them albeit they succumbed to evil. Some of their deeds were characterized by reverence and others by evil, Allah may give up resentment against them and pardon their offense. He accepts true repentance; Allah is indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun
Take O Muhammad from their wealth a sum of money, an offering to set them upon the course of purity of thought and action and to impart sanctity to them, Pray Allah to forgive them; your invocatory prayer pacifies their minds and souls and frees them from mental and spiritual disturbance and from the conflict arising from their sense of guilt, Allah is Sami'un and 'Alimun
Do they not know that Allah is He Who alone has the rightful claim to accepting repentance and the atonement made by His servants and that He accepts offerings, and acts of charity. It is only He Who relents and quits His servants all His debt and He is Rahimun
Say to the people O Muhammad: "Work", that is to say: "Allah and His Messenger and the believers shall watch over your actions. Then you shall be sent back to Him Who is 'Alimun of the invisible and of what your bosoms store of thoughts and feelings, and of the visible and the seen and of what is avowed openly and openly disclosed. Then He shall inform you of all that your minds and your souls had impelled you to do." [this is a reconstruction of the interpretation of this ayat]
There are others the stay -at- home who are held in suspense for an expected decision; Allah may punish them or give up resentment against them and pardon their offence; And Allah is 'Alimun, and Hakimun
Those who built a Mosque professedly from religious motives when in fact it was built from selfish and evil motives: to be a vexation to the Muslims, to establish infidelity, to be a mere nest of the conspirators against Islam to cause dissent among the Muslims and set them at variance and to be an outpost for the warriors who fought against Allah and His Messenger before. They swear to you O Muhammad that they only mean good, but Allah knows well and bears witness that they are liars
Never set foot in it, nor perform an act of worship therein. A Mosque built on piety, obedience to Allah and the intention of serving Allah's purpose from the first day merits visiting for the purpose of worship; it is the most appropriate and the most worthy place for the purpose. Therein are people who aspire to physical purity and the purity of their souls and their minds. And Allah likes those who are physically, morally and spiritually pure
Is he who has built his structure on a foundation of piety and the gratification of Allah better or the one who has built his structure on a foundation of impiety featured by a building founded on an undermined sandcliff which collapses and crumbles away in the fire of Hell! And Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness the wrongful of actions
Their building which, crumbled to pieces in the fire of Hell shall not cease to be the cause of mental pain, sorrow and distress to their hearts, alarm and suspicion to their conscience until the day their hearts are crushed with sorrow and the day they die, and Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun
Allah has bought from those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand their lives and their wealth in exchange for Paradise. They strive in His cause whether they gain victory or be martyrized in His cause. It is a solemn promise Allah has pledged in AL-Tawrah (the Torah), AL-Injil (the Gospel) and the Quran, and who can honour and fulfill his promise better than Allah. Therefore, you may rejoice O Muslims at the bargain you have made to your advantage; This is indeed triumph supreme
Those who have the distinguished attributes of
it is not in conformity with reason wherefore the Prophet together with those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand make an invocatory prayer asking Allah's mercy on those Pagans who died with minds captivated in disbelief in Allah, even though they be of the same kin especially after they have been assured by Allah that such persons are destined to the abode in Hell
The invocatory prayer made by Ibrahim on behalf of his father was in fulfillment of a promise he had made to him. But when he realized that his father was an avowed enemy to Allah, he declared his innocence of his ills and of his fatherhood. Indeed Ibrahim constantly implored Allah with touching entreaties, and forbearance was an attribute of his
Nor would Allah lead, people into error after He has guided them lo His path of righteousness until He has explicitly made known to them what they must avoid and they did not, Allah is indeed 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all in all
To Allah belongs the Absolute sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and causes animate existence and He occasions death and deprives of animate existence. And besides Allah you people have no tutelary protector nor is- there anyone who affords you help
Allah has accorded mercy to the Prophet and his troops who followed him and united in one body behind him at the hour of distress throughout the difficult days of the expedition* -scorching heat and inadequate supplies- when some of them lost heart through incipient weakness, and were about to lose field. Allah was merciful to them; He sustained them spiritually and upheld their pined bodies and minds after He has confirmed their true inclination and the truth of their firm disposition. He was gracious to them and indeed Rahimun. * Tabuk
As for the three affluent and able men, yet thoughtless, slack and wanting in strength of will who were boycotted and excluded from the life of the community to the end that, vast as it is, the earth seemed drawn together and constricted and their souls constrained. Poor in spirit, they realized through self- reproach that they would not and could not flee from Allah but could find solace in coming back to Him. He gave up resentment against them and pardoned their offense so that they would in lowliest plight repentant stand. Allah is AL-Tawab (Relenting) Who accepts repentance and the atonement made by the people; and He is AL-Rahim (Merciful)
O you who have conformed to Islam: entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and be an integral part of those who are strongly and habitually disposed to tell the truth and their words and their deeds together accord
It was not right nor was it excusable that the Muslim residents of Madina and those of the desert Arabs round about them desert the Messenger in his expedition and remain behind, nor was there any cause inducing them to prefer their own lives to his. The conclusion of all this is that no thirst, hardship or hunger they suffer in Allah's cause or a scheme they design to outwit and anger the infidels and obtain an advantage over them or whether they gain victory or suffer loss but it is credited to them as a righteous deed; Allah does not annul, withhold or withdraw the fruit which people are entitled to reap from deeds of wisdom and piety
Nor do they spend in divine service little or much nor journey across a valley to strive in the cause of Allah but is credited to their account so that He requites them for every deed at the gauge of the best of what they accomplished
Nor should those who conformed to Islam go forth all at once to the Messenger, but only a group from each community should go to learn from him practical divinity and jurisprudence and convey back such divine knowledge to their people and caution them against provoking Allah's indignation that they may heed
O you who have conformed to Islam: wage war against the infidels who dwell in the adjacent towns round about you; they are a source of danger to you. Let them feel that you are rigorous, unbending, firm and stern but you must realize that Allah upholds those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
When a Surah is sent down, some of them -the hypocrites- insolently and mockingly say to each other: who among you has this Surah impressed his heart with religious and spiritual virtues? Indeed those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand are receptive to divine knowledge; it gives them moral support and confidence and increases their force of reason; their hearts become impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. Stirred by emotion, they rejoice beyond a common joy
Whereas it -the Surah- adds doubt to those whose ill-natured hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being and gives them occasion to uncertainty and increases the degree of their infidelity. They will depart life captivated in disbelief
Do they not perceive by physical and mental sight what is below the surface! They are subjected to a severe test and a strain and they are put to straits once or twice every year that they may hopefully in lowliest plight repentant stand, but they neither repent nor do they reflect
And when a Surah is sent down, they look at one another and express their thoughts in words, thus: "Does anyone see you", they ask, and they take their leave. May Allah turn their hearts and thoughts away from the truth and close their hearts' ears to admonition; they lack diligence and they are a people who have no comprehension of Allah nor of the spoken discourse of reason narrated by His Messenger
O you people: There has come to you a Messenger raised in your midst and related to you by kinship. He is grieved at heart and affected with deep sorrow to see you perfect your ruin and be destroyed by your iniquities which oppress his feelings and his mind. You are his object of care and deep concern with view to guiding you to the path of righteousness, and he is kind, tender and merciful to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
Nonetheless, if they O Muhammad should close their hearts' ears and direct their thoughts away from you, then you simply express in words the invocatory prayer, thus: " Enough is Allah for me; in Him do I find the answer to my purpose, my hopes and my needs; there is no Ilah but He; in Him I trust and He is the Absolute Sovereign of the Great Throne of dominion, authority, grace and mercy
(Alef), L. (Lam), R. (Raa), the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated. These divine words -the preceding and those to follow- are divinely discoursed, verses, constituting the Book -the Quran- and verses wisdom to divine knowledge
Is it so exceptional in peoples' sight to a degree exciting their wonder and astonishment that We inspire one of them with such divine knowledge to warn them and warn all people of the danger of denying Allah, and to announce blissful tidings to those of them who have recognized Him, that Heaven shall set them on their feet secure and esteemed high? Yet the infidels dispute the facts with perspicuous energy, declaring that this, man - Muhammad- is simply a necromancer who stands manifest of sorcery
Allah, your Creator is He Who has created the heavens and the earth in six* days determined by His own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar. Then set He Himself on the Throne of supremacy and dominion, of grace and mercy. He conducts all affairs, and no intercessor is permitted to intercede on behalf of another without His permission. This is Allah, your Creator; you had better revere Him, regard Him with extreme respect and devotion and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; can you not reflect
To Him shall be your return at the end of your life here below. His promise is absolutely true. He started creation and He continues to create and recreate, and on the Day of Resurrection all shall be created anew. Then He justly rewards those who recognized Him and obeyed Him, adored Him with appropriate acts and rites and vested their deeds with wisdom and, piety. He requites those infidels who denied Him with what is commensurate with their evil deeds. Their thirst shall be quenched with broiling water and their faculties of physical perception shall suffer torment by consequence of what their minds and souls had impelled them to do
He is it who made the sun -the central body of the solar system- emit light*, and the moon** -the satellite of the earth- derive its light from it. and reflect it to earth. He determined the divisions of the ecliptic*** for the moon to occupy them on successive days and present its phases according to the extent of its illumination**. This helps you to know the number of the years or reckon the time occupied by the sun in its apparent passage through the signs of the Zodiac and the period of the earth's revolution round the sun forming a natural unit of time, so that you be able to compute time and determine it by calculation. Never did Allah institute this and bring it about but for a serious end that conforms with the truth and agrees with reality. Thus does Allah expound His revelations and render His discourse readily understood by those who reflect
Indeed, in the variation in duration besides the constant alternation and succession symbolic of the night and the day* in addition to all that Allah has created in the heavens and the earth are evident signs betokening Allah's Omnipotence and Authority to people who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Indeed, those who do not entertain the thought and belief of meeting with Allah and facing Him resolutely, and they are content with life here and rest assured and satisfied with it and they are oblivious of His signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority, are they who have lost their way
Such persons were born to be losers. Their abode is Hell in requital of what their minds and souls have impelled them to do
But those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety, shall be recipients of Allah's mercy and grace. Allah guides them along the illumination proceeding from their innermost being to His path of righteousness ending in heaven's realm of beatitude where picturesque rivers flow beneath them as they enjoy a state of supreme felicity in the gardens of supreme bliss
Their invocatory prayer therein shall be: Glory be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes. Their hearty reception therein shall be "Peace", and the conclusion of their prayer shall express their thoughts, thus: Praise be to Allah, the Creator of the universe
If Allah were to hasten His response to people who deserve ill as they invoke Him to hasten His response to confer on them what is good, their Hereafter would be planted in the now. But We give those who do not entertain the thought the Day of Judgement plenty of rope to allow them free action to commit themselves to the loss in the maze of error
When man is touched or befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity, he invokes us for relief, reclining on his side or sitting or standing, and when We deliver him from what was burdensome and exhaustive to the mind, he passes heedless of Allah as if he never invoked Him to relieve him from a misfortune that had befallen him. Thus are the extravagant in their accounts of themselves allured by false hopes springing eternal in their bosoms
Destruction and death of generations that preceded in order of time were events you people must have heard of. They were wrongful of actions. They received Messengers as spectacles and warnings but they refused to give credence to their messages and to the divine enlightenment, thus do We requite the wicked
Then We brought you people into existence and made you the successors to see how you would act and whether or not you would behave like people of sense
When Our revelations are recited to them -to the idolaters- emitting thoughts of piety and divine enlightenment, they react with revulsion of feeling and they insolently say: "Bring a Quran different from this or substitute the words We do not like for others to our taste" Say to them O Muhammad "it is not within my power to make changes of my own accord; I only follow all that is inspired to me, nor do I dare to disobey Allah, my Creator, for the penalty shall be the torment that is suffered on a Momentous Day
Say to them "Had- Allah willed He would not have sent down a Book and I would not have had to recite it to you nor instruct you in practical divinity nor furnish you with authoritative directions as to action. I have lived in your midst for years before it was revealed to me; can you not Reflect
Who then is more wrongful of actions than he who relates to Allah falsehood or denies His revelations and signs demonstrating His Omnipotence and Authority! Indeed the wicked shall never prosper
They worship besides Allah what shall never hurt them nor profit them, and they claim that such objects of worship shall serve as their intercessors pleading on their behalf with Allah! Say to them O Muhammad: Do you inform Allah of what He does not know in the heavens and the earth!" Glory be to Him- and extolled are His glorious attributes; He is infinitely far beyond those whom or which they incorporate with Him
People were but one single nation, then they differed among themselves in opinion and each group cherished a certain view and belief and were altogether set at variance. Had it not been for Allah's word proclaimed beforehand to delay the decision on matters of doubt and dispute among them and to put punishment in respite, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now
They -the idolaters- insolently say: "If only a sign other than the Quran be revealed to evince both his wisdom and the truth of his mission!" Say to them O Muhammad: "Divination of things to come rests in the hands of Allah Who knows the hidden, the unknown and all that is destined to come, therefore, you just wait O people, I will also await with you future events
Should We make people taste Our mercy and benediction following a touch of a misfortune that has befallen them, their cunning borders upon knavery and they direct their roguery against Our signs and revelations. Say to them: "Allah is prompt in having recourse to stratagem and indeed Our watchful guardian angels commit to writing every cunning act that your minds and souls impel you to do
It is He who enables you to travel by land and sea and when you are on board a ship and a gentle breeze arises and the sails catch it and cause the vessel to move through the water before the wind, people rejoice beyond a common joy*. But when the light wind changes to a brisk gale** and waves rise in billows tossing them in every direction and they think they are enclosed by danger on all sides and they are bereaved of hope, they invoke Allah with an unconscious common feeling of an intuitive cognition and belief in Him, reasoning high exclusively of Providence to the end that if He delivers them from this catastrophe they would be indeed thankful
After He has rescued them from a sure disaster, they simply run riot and go unjustly beyond prudent and reasonable limits. O you people, who do not keep a promise nor honour a vow: You had better realize that your imprudence works against your own interest: The enjoyment in life here is evanescent and fleeting and suddenly and soon enough shall you be on your way back to us, and there and then We shall inform you of all that your minds and souls have impelled you to do
Life here below stands similitude exact of the soil which is stirred to activity and swells up by absorption of the rain water falling from the floor of the vault of heaven. The water is imbibed by soil which constitute the victuals of both man and animal causing the vegetal growths to flourish and grow healthy and vigorous. The earth is rendered beautiful and pleasing to the senses and the world comes to be adorned and furnished with all that is ornamental, the natural and the artificial, and when its inhabitants begin to think that it shall always minister to their necessities and pleasure and they are now the masters thereof, there comes Our command to pass by night or by day to convince mankind that it is not in mortals to command success, and we mow it down as if it never flourished the day before. Thus do We expound Our revelations and make Our discourse readily understood by people who reflect
Allah invites to a world of peace in His heaven's realm and He guides whom He will to the path of safety and righteousness
A world in the August presence where He shall requite those who vested their deeds with wisdom and piety with more than they expect; more than what is commensurate with their pious deeds. Never shall their faces be overlaid with unbroken and oppressing, mournful and painful gloom nor with humiliation and shame; these are the inmates of Paradise wherein they wit have passed through nature to Eternity
But those who have committed themselves to an evil line of conduct, the retribution for evil doing is evil of a like nature, in addition to the gloom and the mortification which shall overlay their faces. No one shall they find then to afford them protection against Allah's retributive punishment; their faces shall be coated with gloom; a painful distressing darkness they will have to assume, as if they were wearing a mask made by a mould of a pitch-dark night These are the Inmates of Hell wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering
The Day We throng them all together, We will address them, thus: Stop, where you are, together with your predominant partners whom you incorporated with Allah; you shall hear His verdict and We keep them apart. There and then shall say those who were worshipped to their worshippers: "You did not really worship us, but you worshipped your lust and your inordinate self-esteem and determination
And they add: Allah knows all the facts. He is a witness of our actions and of your actions and He corroborates our statement that we were oblivious of the reverence and veneration you paid to us and of your feelings which were akin to worship
There and then shall every soul come to be fully aware of all that it had advanced in life of good and pious deeds and of all that it had committed of evil deeds. Now, they have been brought back to Allah, their Creator, Who is truth personified. Now they are renounced and forsaken by those whom they presumed to share with Allah His divine nature and who have failed their expectations
Say to them -the infidels- O Muhammad: "Who supplies you with the provisions from the Heavens and the earth and with the means of sustaining your lives? Who has control over the faculties of hearing and sight, faculties divine? Who causes the living* to egress from the dead and causes the dead to fall from the living? And Who conducts all affairs? Ironically, they will say: "Allah". Then say to them: "Will you, then, not entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
This, then, is Allah, your Creator, Who is truth personified. If you disregard the truth, there remains only false beliefs and departure from moral righteousness. Therefore, how do you people counsel deaf and turn away from the truth
Thus was the word of Allah verified and proved true against the wicked who just do not give credence to the truth nor do they accord Allah recognition
Say to them: "Is there any one among your predominant partners whom -you presume to share with Allah His divine nature who can start creation from nothingness and reproduce it? Then say to them: " Allah does start creation from nothingness and reproduces it and on the Day of Resurrection He shall create all anew, therefore, how could you be strongly deluded so as to believe a lie
Say to them O Muhammad: "Is there anyone among your predominant partners whom you presume to share with Allah His divine nature, who can guide people into all truth!" Then say to them: Allah's spirit of truth guides to all truth, therefore, does He Who guides to all truth not merit to be followed, or he who cannot act as a guide and needs to be guided!" "What ails you people that you cannot apprehend mentally the difference nor arrive at a sound and correct Judgement
Most of them only follow the false suppositions and the incitement arising from the state of their minds and feeling. An opinion offered on insufficient presumptive evidence cannot override the truth nor overrule it; Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all that they do
Nor could this Quran be contrived by anyone even if he is of singular ingenuity. Its inimitability, guidance and precision betoken its divine nature and exclude all else besides Allah. It corroborates and authoritatively validates all the divine Books revealed before it in time and serves as an excellent interpretation expounding all the statutes and ordinances past and present revealed to all intelligent creatures and exacts obedience from the whole. It is undoubtedly a Revelation emphatically revealed by Allah, the Creator of the universe and of the world-to-come
Or do they say: "He Muhammad has forged it" Say to them: "If you do believe I did, then produce one Surah the like thereof, and call on all those besides Allah whom you can possibly engage to venture upon this undertaking if indeed you are declaring the truth
The fact is that: they deny the Quran and assert that it is false without deliberating on its divine discourse and without knowledge of its precepts, nor has its interpretation been given yet. Similarly reacted their predecessors under the vexations of their minds, and you can see the fatal consequence of the wrongful of actions
Nonetheless, among them are some who give credence to it and hold it as true and divine, while others do simply refuse to receive it with favour or consenting mind. But Allah, your Creator, knows best those who are characterized with prepensed malice
However, if they should charge you O Muhammad with falsehood, you just say to them: "I am responsible for my deeds and you are responsible for yours; you are innocent of my actions and I am innocent of what your minds and souls impel you to do
Among them are some who listen to your discourse on practical divinity but they counsel deaf. Therefore, do you think you will be able to communicate with those whose their hearts' ears are closed and they fail to reflect
Among them are those who stare at you with vacant minds, therefore, would you be able to guide those whose their minds' eyes are blind, unable to perceive mentally or apprehend by thought
Allah does not and shall not do injustice to any one not even in the slightest degree, but it is the people who wrong themselves through perversity of judgement or persistence and obstinacy in erroneous opinion
On the Day He throngs them before Him for judgement, they shall bring back to the mind their life below appearing to them, then, as though it had lasted for no more than one hour of the time of daylight, and they shall recognize each other by the distinctive features, the appearance and the character. There and then shall the losers be those who denied Resurrection and the audience of Allah, who were misdirected in action and thought and had the wrong purpose and intention
We either show you, in your life time O Muhammad some part of the promised retributive punishment, or occasion your death before you witness this punishment. Then to us they are destined to return, and Allah is Shahidun (Omnipresent) and He witnesses all that they do
To every people, generation or nation has a Messenger been sent to admonish them to seek Allah, their Creator and draw near to him. Following his death, the legacy of thought and the message of truth were committed to a delegate until another Messenger was sent, And in Day of judgment shall every Messenger bear witness to his peoples' response, and people shall be judged and every one is rendered his due and no one shall be wronged
The infidels ask as usual: "When shall it -the Day of judgment- be, if you - the Messenger and his followers- are declaring the truth
Say to them: "I have no control over what will come nor of what will befall me, be it bad or good, but as Allah Wills" And to every people, all and each, We have ordained a definite point of time, and when their. time is fulfilled never shall they be able to delay it or anticipate it for one hour or infinitely less
Say to them: "What if Allah afflicts you with a penalty by night or by day in requital of your evil deeds or your Hereafter be planted in the now; what benefit would you -the wicked- derive from it that you wish it to be hastened on
Is it only now that your Hereafter is planted you admit that it is carried on from discourse and design to reality and effect, when in life below you mockingly challenged it and wished it be hastened on
There and then shall the wrongful of actions be told: "Now taste the eternal punishment laid on the damned; shall you be requited but with what is commensurate with your evil deeds
They mockingly and insolently ask you O Muhammad with a strong bias toward the disparagement of Resurrection and of the Quran and its threat or menace of committing the infidels to Hell-Fire, and wonder interrogatively if this be true! Say to them: "By Allah, my Creator, it is indeed true; it is as true as is the needle to the pole, and you just cannot counteract the laws and statutes of the Realm nor can you escape
If every sinful soul were so affluent that it held in possession all the riches on earth, it would gladly pay it in expiation of its guilt with pining regrets and vain repentances when they are confronted with the horrid punishment. There and then they are judged with equity and justice and no one shall ever be wronged
Indeed, to Allah alone belongs all that exists, be it visible or invisible, in the heavens and on earth. In point of fact the promise uttered by Allah is the truth personified but most of them -the infidels- do not seem to realize this fact
He gives life and causes animate existence and He occasions the moment of death, and to Him the whole and all in all are destined to go back
O you people, there has come to you from Allah, your Creator, an authoritative admonition exhorting you to recognize Him and urges you to what is good and laudable. It serves as an incitement to worship no one but Him and as remedy for your hearts and minds from sinful infirmities of idolatry and infidelity and as a guide and mercy to those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Say to them: You people ought to rejoice at Allah's grace and mercy - His guidance to the path of righteousness, the illumination and enlightenment, reason, sense and endless advantages summed up in you and outweighing all that you accumulate of the mundane things of this life
Say to them: Do you see the victuals with which Allah has provided you of His bounty, both from heaven and from beneath your feet, and you took the liberty to classify them according to your desire into the permissible and the forbidden insisting that all pleasures are good! Was it Allah Who permitted you to do so or do you take a persistent stand to relate to Allah falsehood and promote your own falsehood
What shall you do then on the Day of Resurrection and Judgement when you stand before Allah indebted and committed for your intentional assertion of falsehood! Indeed, Allah's grace abounds in people but most of them show indisposition to acknowledge His bounty and display want of gratitude
We do know that you -the Messenger- have delivered the divine message, no matter whether you are engaged in the affairs of mankind or in the ordinary pursuits of life or in any other concern, and no matter how little, or how much you recite of the Quran, and no matter what you people do or undo or accomplish but We are witnesses thereof. We experience it by personal observation as you busy yourselves for good or ill. Nor is there anything in an atom's weight on earth or in heaven that escapes your Creator's knowledge nor lesser or larger in amount or degree but is recorded in a documentary book that furnishes evidence of facts and events
Indeed, those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand who chose to be under Allah's tutelage are they who are safe and secure; they have no ground for alarm nor shall fear or dread fall upon them, nor shall they come to grief
They have faithfully recognized Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him
The news of joyful events are hereby announced to them in this world and in the world-to-come. The words uttered by Allah are not alterable, meaning that divine assurance of present and future good or blessing is irrevocable and this is indeed triumph supreme
Therefore, let not their- the infidels' - vain and unreasonable discourse O Muhammad grieve you at heart. Might, honour and Omnipotence are all asserted as Allah's own; He is Sami'un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and 'Alimun
Indeed, all that exists in the heavens and on earth and all creatures in the heavens and on earth belong to Allah alone. Those infidels who incorporate with Him other deities pervert the facts; they only follow the false suppositions and the incitement arising from the state of their minds and feelings; they simply lie and indeed they lie in their teeth
He -Allah- is it Who designated for you a period of darkness -the night-* to take your natural repose and recuperate, and a period filled with -light the day- to have clear perception of things and acquire experience of the activities of human existence. These are phenomena emblematic indeed of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, phenomena that are appreciated and faithfully recognized by people who bow down their ears to the truth
They -The infidels- insolently said: Allah has taken up a son; glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes; He is infinitely Independent and Absolute. To Him alone belong all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. Do you people have proof or solid information or a valid indication to evidence your ugly and false allegation ! Do you relate to Allah what you do not know nor able to prove
Say to them -the infidels-: "Those who charge Allah with false and malicious misrepresentation shall fare ill; they shall go farther and fare worse
Possessions here and all that affords pleasure shall not be enjoyed for long; life here is a scene of evanescent and fleeting glory. Then back to us they return and there and then shall We afflict them with the torment laid upon the damned who thrived on denying Allah and on disobeying His commands
Narrate to them O Muhammad the story of Nuh (Noah); it might bring them to their senses. He said to his people: "My people, if you feel that my abode among you and my constant reminding you of Allah's message and of your duty to Him are annoying you and exhausting your patience, in Allah I trust and no one can stop me from doing my duty to Him. Therefore, get together with your predominant partners whom you claim to have authority over you besides Allah and decide on a course of action not objectively doubtful and fulfill it against me and give me no respite
And if you counsel deaf and disregard Allah's commands, I do not charge you a price for imparting to you Allah's revelations and disclosures, wisdom and practical divinity. My reward rests at the hands of Allah and I have been commanded to be among those who conform to Islam
Yet they charged him with falsehood, and by consequence We rescued him by putting him together with those who fell in line with him on board ship -The Ark- and made them the successors. We drowned those who denied Our divine Message and signs. Now look to see what was the fate of those who were warned of impending danger and misfortune and they refused to pay heed
In succession, We sent Messengers, each carrying a divine message to his people. They presented them with enough signs to guide them out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment. But they would not give credence to what they had rejected aforetime. Thus do We deafen the hearts' ears of those whose thoughts thrive on disobedience and transgression
Subsequently We sent Mussa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) to Pharaoh and his people to present them with Our divine message imparting intellectual enlightenment and illumination. But they turned indignant and displayed inordinate self-esteem and confirmed themselves in prepensed malice and were a people steeped in crime
They labelled the divine truth presented to them through Our Messenger Mussa necromancy displayed by a necromancer capable indeed of skilled sorcery
Do you people" said Mussa, "Call the truth presented to you, sorcery! Is this sorcery! But indeed, never shall the sorcerer be able to withstand the truth
They said to Mussa: "Did you come to us to dissuade us to disregard our fathers' system of faith and worship in order to be the distinguished above all others and the exalted in rank and station in the land! Never. Notwithstanding that we do not believe you nor do we give credence to your message
There and then said Pharaoh to his commanders: "Fetch me every necromancer who is skilled in magic
When all the skilled sorcerers assembled themselves unto Pharaoh. Mussa said to them: "Throw forth what you have up your sleeves
And when they cast loose their devices, Mussa said to them: "What you have just displayed is simply an illusion which shall be extinguished by Providence. Allah does not make the work of the mischievous answer its purpose
By His words does Allah assert the truth, even though it is hateful to the wicked
The people of pharaoh, knew Mussa to be in the right. Nonetheless, only a few of them gave credence to the message through fear of Pharaoh and of the Pharonic nobility lest they should persecute them. Pharaoh was indeed an unmerciful tyrannical ruler in the land, who strayed beyond just limits, and in every manner and degree was he flagrantly excessive
Then, Mussa said to his people: My people; if you have really accepted Allah and conformed to His will then in Him you must trust if indeed you have conformed to Islam
There, they said: "In Allah we trust". and they expressed their thoughts in the invocatory prayer, thus: "O Allah our Creator, uphold us and forsake us not, lest we should come to the wrong-headed's lure and be lured into their snare and suffer persecution
And deliver us through Your mercy from the infidels who are wrongful of actions
There, We inspired Mussa and his brother Harun to provide their people with dwellings in the land of Egypt, and We said to them: "Make of your homes oratories representing a Qibla (Kibl)
Mussa prayed, thus: "O Allah, our Creator ", he said, "You have graced Pharaoh and the Pharonic nobility with material grandeur of impressive character and You gave them riches and abundance of valuable possessions which induced them to stray from Your path of righteousness" "O Allah, our Creator, reduce their riches to insignificance and deafen their hearts' ears to the end that they do not recognize You until they have apprehended by sight the torment laid upon the damned
And there, Allah said: "The prayer petitioned by you and your brother O Mussa has been granted; you just keep to the path of righteousness and do not follow the path of those who are lacking intellectual acquaintance with the facts
We led Bani Isra‘il (the Children of Israel) across the sea whereupon Pharaoh and his troops pursued them with the intention of persecuting them and unjustly and wrongfully torturing them. Such intention had prevailed until the moment when the sea- water overwhelmed them in abundance and Pharaoh realized that he was drowning. There and then he uttered his pining regrets and vain repentances and said: " Now do I realize that there is no Ilah but Him Who has been recognized by Bani Isra‘il and I submit to join those who have conformed to Islam
Now", said Allah that you are besieged by horror and caught in the jaws of death, you are willing to submit when as yet you have withheld obedience and refused to conform to My will and you were a byword for wickedness arid infirmity of purpose
Today", Allah added, "We deliver only your corpse so as to serve as a deterrent to your successors and to be a sign betokening Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, albeit many among people are indeed heedless of Our signs
We confirmed Bani Isra‘il and provided them with good and satisfying dwellings and provisioned them with the good and wholesome victuals. Yet they only set themselves at variance after they had received divine knowledge illumination and enlightenment. But Allah shall judge between them in Day of Judgement on the strained points upon which the whole unreasoning turns
If you O Muhammad or any of your followers are in doubt of what has been inspired to you, then you may ask those who have been reading and perusing the Book before you and interpreting it in thought with understanding of what it meant and not what it merely implied. Therefore, do not let their assertion of what is false make you doubtful and anxious
Nor should you or anyone of those who followed you be among those who deny Allah's revelations and signs lest you be a part of those who were born to be losers
Indeed those whose thoughts thrived on disobedience have verified Allah's divine preordination declared in words thus: "These were born to it; they shall not conform to Allah's will nor to His system of faith and worship
They just would not believe even if they be presented with every supernatural sign clearly betokening Allah's Omnipotence and Authority until they meet face to face with the torment Allah lays upon the damned
Wherefore Had any town conformed to Allah's will, inducing the people to piety profiting by it, but they did not, except the people of Yunus who no sooner did they conform to Allah's will than they were the recipients of His mercy. We cancelled their misfortunes which drew upon them worldly disgrace and shame and had greatly injured their name. And We granted them comfort and enjoyment and all that advantaged them of Allah's blessings in life, up to a predetermined point of time
Had Allah willed O Muhammad, He would have induced all people domiciled on earth to conform to His will and to His system of faith and worship. Would you then twist peoples' opinions into accordance with your party and force them to conform to Islam
No soul yields itself servant to Allah but by His leave, and Allah lays the charge to the doors of those who have come within the measure of His wrath. They are characterized with dullness of comprehension
Say to them -the infidels-: "Look attentively and contemplate mentally and take note of all that is in the heavens and on earth, all indicating an Omnipotent unique Maker! But what shall it advantage a man and what good do the signs and the warnings do to a people who simply refuse to recognize Allah and heed Him
Do they expect but the burdensome and troublesome days, the like of those eventful days exhaustive to the minds of their predecessors! Say to them: " You just await the justice prepared above in heaven's realm. I will await it also
There and then will We deliver from peril Our Messengers together with those who accepted them and recognized their missions. Thus it is a duty incumbent on us to save those who conformed to Our will and to Our system of faith and worship
Say to them: "O you people, if you are in doubt of my religion the divinely approved system of faith and worship, you had better realize that I do not conform to Worshipping those whom you worship besides Allah, but I do adore with appropriate acts and rites the only Ilah, the Creator, Who alone controls your destiny and disembodies your souls". " And I have been commanded to be among those who have recognized Him with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Set your face and rest your eyes sincerely upon Allah and your heart on religion with sincere feelings and actions, and never be one of these who incorporate with Allah other deities
Nor invoke besides Allah what shall not profit you nor harm you, for if you do, you shall then be one of those who are wrongful of actions
You must realize that should Allah befall you with a misfortune or wed you to a calamity, no one shall be able to cancel it but Him. And if He mercifully befalls you with a good fortune, no one can obstruct His bounty with which He graces whom He will among His servants, and He is Ghafurun (Forgiving), and Rahimun (Merciful)
Say to them Muhammad: "O you people, now has the truth come to you from Allah, your Creator, and he who chooses to follow the path of righteousness shall only profit his own soul, and he who chooses to stray and loses himself in the maze of error shall only harm his own soul, and I am not here to watch over your innocence and folly
And adhere O Muhammad to all that is inspired to you and exercise patience until Allah pronounces His judgement, for He is It Who gives the law whereas all other judges just interpret it
(Alef), L. (Lam), R. (Raa), the Surah opens with these, letters introductory from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
It directs the Messenger to instruct people thus: "Never worship you people, anyone but Allah. I am delegated by Him to warn you and give you a cautionary advice regarding your system of faith and to announce to you joyful tidings if you should turn to Allah and lift to Him your inward sight
And you had better invoke Allah, your Creator, for forgiveness and in lowliest plight do stand to Him repentant of the way you conduct yourselves in life. He shall make you enjoy good things in life up to a predetermined point of time". "He shall bestow on every one of merit, here below, His divine favour that is commensurate with his merits and shall His grace abound in those entitled to it Hereafter" And should they turn a deaf ear, then say to them: "I only fear for you the punishment which shall be laid upon the damned on an unbearably Momentous Day
To Allah shall all of you return, and He is indeed Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things
They -the infidels- bend their chests to hide, as it were, their thoughts and feelings from Allah! Do they not realize that even when they clothe themselves taking to their beds and lurk themselves enshrouded in the Veil of night, that Allah does know all that their bosoms store of thoughts and feelings, and all that they suggest secretly to their minds, He is well acquainted with all that they utter loudly and with what they whisper below their breath! Indeed Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all private thoughts and feelings riposted in the breasts
There is not one single creature domiciled on earth but derives its sustenance from Allah Who knows its settled habitation and the duration of its life span. He also knows the site of its future interment and when it shall be reclaimed for Judgement Hereafter. All such events are recorded in a Book manifest of precision
He is it who created the heavens and the earth and brought them into existence in six days* determined by His own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar; His Throne of supremacy and dominion and of grace and mercy was then set over the water** He created the universe and you people as a part of it in Order to determine which of you performs the better deed and whether his deeds agree with his words and whether his work is imprinted with wisdom and piety! Yet when you O Muhammad say to them that they shall rise again at the Last Day after they had been dead and buried, the infidels shall say: " This is nothing but sheer sorcery assumed by him
And if We in all manner of wisdom delay their retributive punishment to a determined point of time giving them a chance to come-back to their senses, they shall say: "What keeps it back!" Indeed the Day the punishment comes about and falls to their lot, no expedient shall ever avert it, and on all sides shall they be beset by the same material and immaterial things they turned in to ridicule
And if We should extend to man Our mercy and make him taste Our benediction then We justly decide to withhold it, he nurses despair forgetting the other advantages he enjoys and looks for the how, the why and the wherefore and becomes sour and in bitterness he turns his, worst side outwards
And if We reverse the action and grace him with a merited or an unmerited favour following a touch of misfortune, he says: "Now I have been freed of misfortunes", and he rejoices beyond a common joy and he boasts the event and exalts himself unduly and displays inordinate self-esteem
Such an attitude is never adopted by those who exercise patience and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety. Such persons are the recipients of Allah's mercy and forgiveness and deserve a great reward
You Muhammad seem inclined to omit the recital of a part of what is revealed to you, the part that depresses your spirits and oppresses your thoughts and feelings because it is not to the infidel's liking. You think that by so doing, Allah's message of truth would be accepted more readily and the infidels shall not use the usual formula of insolence and say: "If only a treasure were sent down to him from heaven or an angel to companion him, we may be induced to recognize his mission". You must realize that you are only a spectacle and a warning, and Allah is the Tutelary Guardian of the whole and of all in all
Or do they say: "He has forged it" the Quran! Say to them: "You people are magniloquent; your art of speaking and writing is irresistibly impressive; wherefore do produce ten forged Surahs, each bearing reference to a different aspect of the same thought and call on those besides Allah whom you can possibly engage to venture upon this undertaking if indeed you are declaring the truth
And if they do not respond and such an undertaking they fail to fulfill, then you people must realize that the Quran has indeed originated from Allah and revealed by His Authority, and there is no Ilah but He. Therefore, are you unbelievers going to conform to Islam if indeed you are seeking the truth
Those who are concerned only with the interests and pleasures of this life and its temporal and mundane things may rest assured that We will apportion to them in full what is due to them and make them reap the fruits accruing from their worldly deeds and they shall not be wronged
But such persons are those who shall be denied Allah's mercy Hereafter, and Hell is where they make abode. Their hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness, and vain indeed and useless, unprofitable and unavailing shall be all their worldly deeds
Do they compare!: the esteemed virtuous by the whole and his inmost thoughts and innermost being are flood lit with divine enlightenment and witnessed by the Quran featuring Providence as the guide, and before the Quran by the Book of Mussa (Moses) feathering Allah's mercy on the Children of Israel and the spirit of truth guiding into all truth
And who is more wrongful of actions than he who lit relates to Allah falsehood! These and their like shall assemble themselves unto Allah, their Creator, in Day of Judgement and there and then be reprimanded by the witnesses- the angels, the Messengers and the men of piety saying: "These are they who related to Allah, their Creator, all they could devise of falsehood; wherefore the curse of Allah be on those who were wrongful of actions
Who stood in the way to prevent Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth, making it their aim to pervert the truth and crook the path of righteousness to their own ends, and never did they acknowledge the truth of the Hereafter
These infidels and such persons are not in a position ever to overpower Allah nor escape-His retributive punishment. Nor do they have besides Him tutelary protectors to defend them. Their punishment shall be doubled in the train of their obstinacy against divine laws, their adherence to their opinions with their usual struggle to assert falsehood and obstruct the way to Allah's path of righteousness and of their persistence in closing their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes to Allah's discourse
These are they who have lost their own souls and have been forsaken and renounced by those whom they presumed to share with Allah His divine nature, who failed their expectation
It is no wonder shall they be great losers Hereafter
Indeed, those who acknowledged Allah and His Messengers with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety, and their innermost thoughts and being have been compliant with the will of Allah, their Creator, are they whom Allah shall richly gratify; they are the inmates of Paradise wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity
The example of the two parties -those in favour of and those against Allah- stands similitude exact of the two partisans: the adherent to falsehood who is blind and dumb and the adherent to the truth who lifts to Allah his inward sight and opens his heart's ears to admonition. Are they equal for wisdom and integrity or do they deserve the same fate! Can you people not consider this matter and ponder My cause
We sent Nuh to his People with a divine message imparting knowledge of some particular fact and imbued with some graceful and specific attribute, he said to them: "My people I stand manifest of authority delegated to me by Allah, the Creator, to give you a cautionary notice with regard to your system of faith and worship
You must not worship but Allah, the Creator, Whom you should adore with appropriate acts and rites". "if you counsel deaf, then I fear for you an immense punishment on a Momentous Day
But those of his people in whose hearts reigned vices, follies and falsehood said to him: "It is evident that you are no more than a mortal like the rest of us and we do not see that your cause has been espoused but by the abject among us who are deficient in sense and intelligence. Nor do we see that you people are merited with such an attribute distinguishing you or conferring on you an air of distinction; to the contrary we think you are liars
Nuh said: "My people pause here and think, and think but this: What if Allah has enlightened my thoughts and my innermost being and imparted to me knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light and extended to me His mercy to which you are blind on account of lacking intellectual and spiritual light!" "Shall we", he added, "impose on you such spiritual enlightenment when you are prejudiced against it
My people", he said: "I do not charge you a price for what I relate to you of Allah's divine message nor for the divine knowledge imparted to me. The reward for divine service rests only in the hands of Allah". "Nor can I dismiss those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand or send them away on account of your despicable opinion of them or of viewing them with contempt. They shall meet with Allah, their Creator. in Day of Judgment when I shall have much to answer for". "But then I can see that you people are indeed in want of intellect and spiritual knowledge
Can you people tell me", he added, "who shall be able to defend me from Allah and avert His punishment if I dare to dismiss them !" "Can you not reflect
I do not claim to be in possession of the treasuries of Allah, nor do I indulge in prophecy or claim to foretell future events or realize the unseen nor do I say to you I am an angel, or say to you that those whom you view with contempt shall be denied Allah's blessings. Allah knows best their innermost thoughts and feelings". "If I commit myself to such a line of conduct, then I am indeed wrongful of actions
But they said to him: "O Nuh; you have argued to persuade us of your way you are resolved on and to steer our course of action. In fact, much have you argued. Bring down the promised retributive punishment if you are indeed declaring the truth
He said to them: "But it is Allah Who causes His punishment to alight upon you if He will, frand never shall you be able to overpower Him nor escape His punishment
Nor shall my admonition profit you little or much even if I do my best if Allah should decide to lead you in the wrong in the- train of your ill-natured hearts which reflect the morbidity inherent in your innermost being. He is your Creator, and back to Him shall all of you inevitably return
Or do they* say about you Muhammad "He has invented a false story and forged a long tale!" Say to them: "If I have wittingly forged what I am relating to you to make it seem divine, then I am responsible for my falsehood which will have become a crime, and I am innocent of all your wrong actions which render you criminal in Allah's sight
Nuh was inspired by divine influence that: "No more of your people besides those who have already acknowledged the truth of your mission shall conform to Allah's will, therefore, do not be grieved at heart for what their minds and souls have impelled them to do
Build the Ark under Our supervision and according to Our inspired divine instructions. and do not plead with Me for those who are wrongful of actions they are destined to drown
As he was building the Ark he was laughed at, as often as some of those in whose hearts reigned vices and follies went by, they laughed him to scorn. But he said to them: "If you consider us now the laughing-stock, soon enough shall you be the object of laughter and our mouth shall be filled with laughter as yours was
In the end you shall know who is destined to receive the blow that put him to shame and incenses him with multiplied humiliations, and makes him suffer the ever-lasting punishment
When Our command came to pass and the water bubbled up, rose in billows and erupted through the earth's surface inundating the land, We said to him: Carry with you on board ship a pair -a male and a female- of every kind or living creature (or possibly two pairs of each species) together with your family, except those against whom Allah has already pledged His word, and carry those who acknowledged the truth of your mission, they were but some few
Nuh said to those of his people whom he was about to carry: " Go on board ship and rest assured of Allah's mercy. In the Name of Allah shall be its free and secure floatation and when it comes to anchor; Allah, my Creator, is indeed Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
The Ark sailed through waves rising in billows and running mountains high. There and then did Nuh call upon his son who was in isolation, as it were, and said to him: "My son come with us on board ship and do not stay behind with the infidels who disobeyed Allah
I will have recourse" said the son, "to a mountain for shelter. It shall protect me from the overflowing water". "My son" ,said Nuh, "today and under the circumstances neither a mountain nor anything else shall serve as an expedient availing you against Allah's command except him to whom Allah extends His mercy". There, the abundant flow of water, rising in billows, intervened between them, and the son was among those destined to drown
There and then was a divine command pronounced to the weather -beaten earth, thus: "Engulf O earth your water and cease O heaven your rainfall", and the water subsided and the die was cast and the Ark rested securely upon Mount Judy -Gudy-*. and then it was said: "Away with those wrongful of actions
There and then did Nuh pray saying: "O Allah, nay Creator, my son is an integral part of my family and Your promise is the truth personified; it is You Who give the law whereas all other judges just interpret it
He is not a part of your family", said Allah; piety was not an, attribute of your son. Your plea on behalf of your son is not an act of wisdom and piety, therefore, do not invoke Me for something whose consequence you do not know. I exhort you not to be one of those in want of intellect and spiritual knowledge
Nuh said: "O Allah, my Creator, I commit myself to You counter the consequence accruing from an invocatory prayer with a result I do not know; and unless You forgive me and have mercy on me, I will inevitably be one of those born to be losers
He was told: "Disembark O Nuh and go downhill with peace of mind, soul and conscience proceeding from us and with blessings upon you and those with you and upon their descendants who conform to Our will and upon succeeding generations; some We shall bless and others shall We put to the torment laid upon the damned
This true historic account which We relate to you O Muhammad is a narrative of facts and events belonging to the unseen and the unknown. Neither you nor your people knew it before. Therefore, be patient and do realize that the good and happy outcome shall fall to those entertaining the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
Again, We sent to the people of 'Ad (the 'Adites), their brother, the Messenger Hud, who said to them: "O my people, worship Allah and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; no Ilah have you but He. You are indeed a people who forge lies against Allah and criminally relate to Him falsehood
My people", he added, "I do not charge you a price for the divine message I relate to you; the reward for divine service is incumbent on Him Who created me and brought me into being. can you not reflect
My people", he added, "invoke Allah's forgiveness and in lowliest plight stand to Him repentant of the way you conduct yourselves in life. He shall pour down upon you rain and blessings bringing you into a people of condition". "He shall add to your strength to make you stronger in influence and authority, in security of position and in moral power for endurance and effort, in will, purpose and character , in actions and attributes, that you may have great controlling power over things by reason of the possession of authority, resources and inherent qualities. Do not counsel deaf nor lose yourselves in a maze, precipitating your crime
Nonetheless, they said to him: "You never, O Hud, presented to us a clear material evidence evincing your wisdom and the truth of your mission, nor shall we forsake our gods at your word and act accordingly, nor do we give credence to your message
We can only say", they added, "that some of our gods must have affected you physically with an inlay touch of demonic illusions". But Hud said to them: "Allah is my witness and so are you that I am absolutely innocent of your idolatry and of those whom you incorporate with Him
I am innocent Also, of all those whom you invoke besides Allah", wherefore I defy you all, you and your gods, to plot and scheme against me and to do all you can and give me no respite
In Allah, my creator and your Creator, do I trust; there is not an animate or inanimate being but He grasps by the forelock; He is the controlling power over the whole and all in all". "Indeed, Allah, my Creator, stands manifest of Justice and uniqueness of righteousness
Should they counsel deaf", said Allah, then say to them: "I have conveyed to you, my people, the divine message entrusted to me, and you must realize that Allah is indeed capable of replacing you by others and never can you harm Him nor frustrate". "Allah, my Creator, is indeed Vigilant and He keeps a vigilant eye upon the whole and upon all in all
When Our command came to pass, We rescued Hud together with those who gave credence to his Mission and acknowledged Allah's message, an act of mercy vouchsafed by us to save them from a condign punishment
These were the people of 'Ad -the 'Adites- who just would not bow their hearts' ears to the divine revelations nor their minds' eyes to His signs betokening His Omnipotence and Authority, and they adhered to the same evil line of conduct espoused by every stubborn who plays the tyrant
By consequence, they were followed by a curse from Allah all their life, and it shall be worse Hereafter- Indeed, the 'Adites had disobeyed Allah, their Creator, and their hearts dared rise defiant against Him wherefore away from existence were put the 'Adites, the people of Hud
We sent also to the people of Thamud -The Thamudites- their brother the Messenger Saleh, who said to them: "O my people worship Allah and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; You have no Ilah but Him. He raised you from the earth and made it the world you live on. Therefore, invoke His forgiveness and in lowliest plight stand repentant to Him of the way you conduct yourselves in life. Allah, my Creator, is indeed in the immediate proximity of the whole and of all in all and He responds to invocation
But they said to him: "O Saleh, you have been thus far the hope that sprang eternal in our breasts, but we seem to be staking our very future on some dark hope. Do you want us to renounce the system of faith and worship adopted by our fathers! Indeed we question the validity of what you induce us to do and we think it excites suspicion
There did Saleh say: " My people, pause here and think and think but this: what if Allah has enlightened my thoughts and my innermost being and imparted to me knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light and extended His mercy to me! Then, how can I neglect the duty of relating His message to the people when it has been entrusted to me. This shall be disobedience". "if I am to disobey Allah, who then can save me from His punishment!" "You people are simply trying to lead me into error and make me lose my way and incur privation of Allah's mercy
My people", he added, "this is the she -camel of Allah, representing a distinct sign symbolic of the truth of my mission. Let her graze upon the grass- land of Allah and do not lay hands on her nor meddle with her to harm, her, lest you would be overtaken by a dire punishment before long
Thus still they disabled her by cutting her hamstring muscles, and there did Saleh say to them: "You have only three days to lust after your sinful system of faith and worship and after the way you conduct yourselves in life. This, is indeed, an irrevocable promise not proving untrue
When Our command came to pass, We rescued Saleh and those who gave credence to his mission and acknowledged Allah's message, an act of mercy vouchsafed by us to save them from the shame and the multiplied humiliations incurred on that Momentous Day. Allah, your Creator is indeed AL-Qawiy(the Omnipotent) and AL- Aziz Who prevails against the whole and all in all
Direful was the one cry from heaven's realm, it stirred up a merciless blast which overtook the wrongful of actions. There, they were reduced to a useless form laying prostrate and dead under the ruins of their demolished homes
Devastating was the blast and irretrievable was the disaster that they -the Thamudites- looked as if they never dwelt nor flourished whereat they perished. Indeed, the Thamudites had refused to acknowledge Allah, their Creator, and their hearts dared rise defiant against Him, wherefore away from existence were put the Thamudites
For once did Our Messengers -disguised angels- pay a visit to Ibrahim(Abraham) and intimate to him the good news -of begetting a son-. They greeted him with the expression of good will "Peace" which he returned to assure them they were welcomed. Thereafter he placed before them a generous meal of a fatted roasted calf
But when he noticed that they did not stretch out their hands to eat, back he recoiled apprehensive and pervaded with fear. They consoled him and in good will they said to him: "Do not be afraid; we have been sent to those sinful people of Lut(Lot)
His wife, standing in dose proximity, overheard what was said and -laughed in her skepticism- or -in her joy-, and there, We announced to her the good news of begetting a son, Ishaq (Isaa)
There and then she exclaimed: "Dear me, shall I bear and give birth to a child in my age and my husband is an aged man! This is indeed exceptional to a degree that excites astonishment
Do you marvel" "said the Messengers, at the divine command proceeding from Allah! Allah's mercy and blessings be upon you and may all grace be made to abound in you people of the house of Prophethood." Allah is indeed worthy of all praise. He is the final cause of creation and the highest aim of intelligent creatures
Then when Ibrahim divested his robe of fear and his mind was returned to its settled- calmness and was joyful of the good news, he began to show thought and consideration for the people of Lut, pleading with us on their behalf
Forbearance was indeed an attribute of Ibrahim who constantly implored Allah with touching entreaties and lifted to Him his inward sight
But he was told: " Do not envelop yourself. Ibrahim within the folds of a matter already been decided by Allah; they are destined to suffer a condign punishment no expedient can avert
When Our Messengers -disguised as youths- went to Lut, he felt grieved at heart -on account of his expectation- that his perverse people would act sinfully in such a circumstance and he just did not know what to do. Expressing his thoughts in words, he said: "This is indeed a distressful day
His people went to him rushing and intending to precipitate the indecent and immoral act which they had long been practicing before. Lut, having been rushed in a sea of misery, said to them: "These are my daughters, if you wish to join them in wedlock! This will be virtuous and you will be acting with moral righteousness and conformity with inherent, natural, moral and religious laws." "Fear Allah" he said, "and shame me not before my noble guests; is there no one among you characterized by good sense and prudence
Thus still they said to him: "You know very well we do not need your daughters nor do we have the right to claim them; you know quite well what we want
Not knowing what was to happen, Lut said: "If only I could subdue you at your peril or have a powerful support to lean on
There and then declared the messengers their identity and said to Lut: "we are Allah's Messengers, do not grieve at heart, they cannot touch you nor can they harm you; you just leave town together with your family at the dead hours of the night and make sure that none of you turns to look back in the direction from which you are going, but not your wife who is destined to suffer the same fate decreed for the others, and the morning is their zero hour, Is the morning not near upon
When Our command came to pass, We turned those cities - Sodom and Gomorrah- upside down and rained them with fire and successive brimstones as hard as baked clay
A punishment especially prepared in heaven's realm and it is not far from the wrongful of actions whom it marks for its own
We sent to the Midianites their brother, the Messenger Shuaib, who said to them: "My people: worship Allah and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites; no Ilah have you but He. You must not fraudulently scant the measure and the weight; I see that you are a people of condition and I do fear for you the punishment coming into play on a Momentous Day when all the guilty be surrounded and there is no escape
My people", he added, "I advise you to dispense the measure and the weight equitably to the full and not to scant peoples' goods and chattels, chattels personal and chattels real and chattels interest nor devalue what is valuable be it goods or possessions or an article of worth nor create discord or make mischief on earth
The legitimate profits you people gain lawfully according with piety and blessed by Allah are but an advantage to your cause if indeed your hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues". But you must remember, I am not here to watch over your innocence and folly
Thus still they said to him: "Do your prayers, O Shuaib, and system of faith enjoin you to induce us to renounce Our father's system of faith and worship or that we must not use our money at will nor do with it what we will!". But we have always thought you were AL-Halim (the forbearing) and AL-Rashid (a man of min)
There did Shuaib say to them: "My people, pause here and think but this: what if Allah has enlightened my thoughts and my innermost being and imparted to me knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light and made His grace abound in me!" "I want you to realize", he added, "that I do not move you to this divine course of action to advantage myself behind your backs of your dishonest system of trading and its ill-gotten gains. My aim is only reform I wish to brew the best I can until the pious principle governs your thoughts and you abandon wrong - doing. My successful attainment of the desired end rests in the hands of Allah; in Him I trust and to Him I lift my inward sight
My people", he said: "do not let my diversity of opinion and purpose incite you to sink deeper under the vexations of your minds lest you should be destined to suffer the same fate suffered by the people of Nuh or the people of Hud or the people of Saleh nor are the people of Lut far off from you chronologically, chronographically nor geographically
And invoke Allah, your Creator, for forgiveness and in lowliest plight stand to Him repentant of the way you conduct yourselves in life. Allah, my Creator, is indeed Rahimun and Wadud (the Merciful) Who comforts whom He sees in distress
Thus still they said to him: "We can hardly, O Shuaib, grasp with the mind the comprehension you have of Allah, nor do we understand much of your discourse". " In fact we do see that among us, you are but a man wanting in strength and not at all influential, and were it not for your family, we would have pelted you with stones and you are not very strong to prevail against us
My people ", said Shuaib, "is my family more esteemed in your sight than Allah Whom you have cast behind your backs and consigned to oblivion ! Indeed, Allah, my Creator, is 'Alimun (Omniscient), of all that your minds and souls impel you to do
Shuaib continued: "My people, you may pursue what your minds and souls impel you to do, but I am steering my course of action by guiding indications set by Providence Who guides to all truth". "And you shall soon come to know who shall be befallen with a humiliating punishment and who it is that lies and intentionally asserts falsehood. You just be on the watch for the justice prepared above in heaven's realm and I will also be on the watch
When Our commend came to pass, We rescued Shuaib together with those who gave credence to his mission and acknowledged Allah's message, an act of mercy vouchsafed by us to whom We bless. And how direful was the one cry* from heaven's realm stirring up a merciless blast which overtook the wrongful of actions. They were reduced to a useless form and were laid prostrate and dead under the ruins of their demolished homes
Devastating was the blast and irretrievable was the disaster that they -the Madianites- looked as if they never dwelt nor flourished whereat they perished, wherefore away from existence were put the Madianites, just as the Thamudites were swept away
We sent Mussa(Moses) well equipped with signs serving to demonstrate delegated divine power and Authority
We sent him to Pharaoh and his people, but they rejected his principles which formed the basis of a chain of reasoning and followed those of Pharaoh whose principles were unprincipled
And as he -Pharaoh- lead his people in life below to the maze of error, he shall lead them like cattle to Hell Hereafter; evil indeed is the place they are led to
In consequence, they were followed by a curse from Allah all their life, a curse that shall be worse Hereafter. And evil indeed are the maledictions poured upon those who have come in life within the measure of Allah's wrath, a combination that is emblematic of a malignant fate
Such a historic account of the towns is a narrative of facts and events We relate to you O Muhammad; some of them are still standing -in evidence- and others have been mowed down
Never did Allah do injustice to them nor did We deprive them wrongfully of anything, but it was they who imprudently wronged themselves. Nor did their gods they invoked besides Him avail them anything nor did they afford them help when the command of Allah, your Creator, came to pass. To the contrary, they added to their ruin and incurred their privation of Allah's mercy
Thus much is the punishment of Allah, your Creator, when He overtakes the towns whose inhabitants are wrongful of actions and grow daily more and more wicked. The divine act of overthrowing the wicked is indeed painful and terrifying
Indeed, the narrative of these events represents convincing divine evidence of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority to those who dread the inevitable punishment in Day of Judgement, the Day when the whole shall assemble themselves unto Allah and be witnesses of their own past doings
The Day We delay but to a predetermined point of time
And when it -this Day-comes, trembling shall be so great that no one can utter a word but at Allah's command. Some sinking in a sea of misery and some rejoicing beyond a common joy
As for those sorely distressed, the intended end of their journey is Hell where they make abode wherein they pant, emitting with difficulty a deep breath and drawing with more difficulty a long breath, heaving sighs and giving vent sobs. In fact none will have ever brayed so pitifully
They shall remain within as long as the heavens and the earth last except as Allah wills; Allah, your Creator, does what He will
But those whom Allah has graced, shall make abode in Paradise wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity that lasts pari passu with the duration of the heavens and the earth except as Allah wills, a divine authoritative bestowal that is continual and unceasing
Therefore, do not doubt -O Muhammad- the evil outcome of the system of faith and worship these people the -idolaters- follow. They follow but the same system their fathers have adopted before. We will apportion to them their share of punishment commensurate with their evil deeds, a punishment which shall neither be diminished nor be abated
Perhaps Allah will not subject them to annihilation here below on account of the Book -the Quran- which gives free circulation of divine enlightenment and information. The same course of action was adopted when We gave Mussa the Book - AL-Tawrah (the Torah)- and his people were disputant about it, and had it not been for Allah's word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment in respite, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. Those people were as suspicious of AL- Tawrah, as your people -O Muhammad- are of the Quran
Nonetheless, both those and these and all and each shall Allah, your- Creator, requite with what is commensurate with their deeds; He is 'Alimun (Omniscient) indeed of all that their minds and souls impel them to do
Therefore, you Just tread -O Muhammad- together with those who turned to Allah the path of life and action in the manner ordained and lift to Him your inward sight the best you can so as to be men of singular piety, righteousness and virtue. But do not carry things to excess nor transgress. He is Bassirun (Omnipresent) and He sees all that your minds and souls impel you to do
Nor should your hearts be inclined to follow the wrongful of actions lest you come to be fuel for the Fire, and besides Allah you just have no tutelary protectors nor shall you be afforded the needed help
Observe your act of worship at both ends of the day -the early morning and the close of the day- and at the early hours of the night -following sunset and before bed time- and keep in mind that pious and virtuous deeds cancel evil deeds. This is simply a reminder for those who keep Allah in mind and lift to Him their inward sight
In patience possess you people your souls, therefore, be patient and remember that Allah does not annul, withhold or withdraw the fruit people are entitled to reap from deeds of wisdom and piety
If only there had been among the preceding generations a class of persons virtuous, strong and influential enough to warn people against corruption and to forbid mischief on earth and prohibit perversion as did the few of them whom We saved. But the wrongful of actions pursued pleasure, and lust after the mundane vanity they were entangled with, and were steeped in crime
Nor would Allah, your Creator, unjustly destroy the towns when their inhabitants are brewing reform and the fundamental truth governs their thoughts
And had Allah, your Creator, willed, He would have made mankind one single nation conforming to one religion. Nonetheless, their innate incongruity would have induced them to be thus still at variance
But not those whom Allah has graced with His mercy. In this Manner of freedom of choice and of thinking did He bring mankind into being. Thus has the word of Allah, your Creator, answered the purpose and complied with His decree, thus: "I will fill Hell with the Jinn together with mankind who were wrongful of actions, guilty of defiant impiety and whose lawless desires were seas scorning all bounds
We relate to you O Muhammad these various narratives of the Messengers who were sent before you, representing their determined effort under difficulties to accomplish the necessary end. We narrate them to you to confirm your heart, do it good and strengthen it in purpose and action. In the recital of these facts, you shall find O Muhammad narratives with grace divine imbued, imparting the spirit of truth guiding into all truth , exhorting and reminding those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
Say O Muhammad to those infidels who deny Allah: "You may pursue what your minds and souls impel you to do, but we are steering our course of action by guiding principles set by Providence Who guides into all truth
And await the justice prepared above in heaven's realm; we will await it also
To Allah, alone, belongs the knowledge of all that is unknown, invisible and unseen in the heavens and the earth, and to Him, the ultimate Authority are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and Hereafter. Therefore, worship Him and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites and put your trust in Him; He is never oblivious of all that you do
(Alef), L. (Lam), R. (Raa), the Surah opens with these letters introductory front the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated. These are divinely discoursed verses flowing with the precision and grace that are symbolic of the Book -the Quran- the spirit of truth that guides into all truth
it is a Book We have revealed in Arabic literary form, that you people may hopefully comprehend its inimitability and employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions
Bearing upon your present circumstances, We relate to you O Muhammad a most engaging story thought and felt in superlatives. It constitutes an integral part of the Quran We reveal to you, notwithstanding that before it you were unmindful of divine knowledge, true events and illumination and enlightenment
For once Yusuf said to his father -Ya'qub (Jacob)- "O my father, a vividly descriptive image was presented to my mind in my sleep portraying eleven planets, the sun and the moon bowing to the ground in reverence and obeisance to me
His father expressed his thoughts in words with grace divine imbued; he said to him: "My son, relate not your vision to your brothers -half brothers- lest they plot against you and entice you into danger: actuated by envy, they may fall as puppets in the hands of AL-Shaytan (Satan) who is indeed an avowed enemy to man
Thus", he continued, "will Allah, your Creator, choose you and impart to you the knowledge of interpreting visions and sense impressions in sleep and what they prefigure of future events, He complements his bounty and munificence to you and to the progeny of Ya'qub as much as He made all grace abound in your grandfathers Ibrahim (Abraham) and Ishaq (Isaac) before. Allah, your Creator is indeed 'Alimun (Omniscient) and Hakimun (Wise)
Indeed, there have been in the story of Yusuf and his brothers an instructive occurrence, an example, a warning and a lesson for those who are seeking the world and its pursuits as well as for those who are in search of the truth and spiritual knowledge
Conspiring against him, the brothers said: "Yusuf and his brother -full brother, Benjamin- are indeed nearer to our father's heart and closer to his affection than we are, our father stands indeed manifest of error; he manifests forth a straying mind
They settled the question and pronounced judgment: "Remove Yusuf out of the way" they said, "either by death or by taking him away to some distant land, and thereafter you stand in lowliest plight repentant to Allah of your evil deed and characterize yourselves with righteous living
But one of them said: "Do not kill Yusuf, for such an act shall be a grave error that threatens a fatal result; throw him down the well where he would be out of sight, and there, he will be picked up by some company of merchants, travellers or others, that is if you have indeed decided to get rid of him
And so, they asked their father: "Our father, why do you not trust us for the care of Yusuf! Our first wish in life is for his happiness and welfare
Send him with us tomorrow", they said, "to enjoy himself, to eat and drink in a picnic fashion and to take part in a game affording him pleasure, and we will take care of him and see that he is not exposed to danger
It grieves me at heart to part with him," said the father "especially when I have an uneasy sense of the probability of the boy being brutally assailed and devoured by a wolf at a moment when you are oblivious of him it
They protested, thus: "If this be true"t, they said, "and the wolf were to devour him when we are a collective mass of men, then we will have incurred privation of attributes and it would be a lost sorrow to wail our fall
And they took him and went away, and agreed among themselves, and were united in thought, to place him at the bottom of the well -said to have been dry-. There and then We inspired just confidence and peace of mind to him -Yusuf- and inspired him with the feeling, thus: "You shall one day inform them of the evil they had committed against you at a time when they fail to recognize you nor perceive ever they shall see you again
And they came back home to their father in the evening weeping their fill
They said to him: "O father, we went racing to compete with each other leaving Yusuf to take care of our things and there, standing alone, he was devoured by the wolf". "But you do not seem to believe us albeit we are telling the truth
They brought back his garment stained with false blood. Their father said: "Indeed your minds and souls have enticed you to do something unpleasant and impelled you to feign this tale; in patience do I possess my soul and in Allah do I seek help to bear with composure what you have just described
There came a caravan of merchants traveling to Egypt with merchandise. They sent on their water purveyor, the harbinger, who found a well; he let his bucket to draw water. But as he hauled up the bucket, he did not find water but a youth clinging to the rope and the bucket instead. There he announced with joy the good news of hauling up a youth, and they hid him in their merchandise, and Allah was fully aware of what they were doing
They sold him to a slave-dealer for a small price amounting to a small number of silver coins, and they had no interest in him
Being divinely gifted with the letter of credit nature has written upon his face honoured wherever presented, he was outbid in the slave market by a high court Egyptian official (AZIZ) who said to his wife: " Treat him kindly and with honour and respect to enjoy his stay; he may prove useful to us and helpful in effecting a purpose, or we may adopt him as a son." Thus did We establish him firmly in the land, wherefore We imparted to him the knowledge of interpreting visions and sense impressions in sleep and what they prefigure of future events. Allah prevails upon His edict which inevitably produces its intended effect and answers its purpose, but most people do not realize this fact
Then when he –Yusuf- reached the stage of life wherein he had the ability for effective action and firmness of mind, character, will and purpose, We imparted to him wisdom and divine knowledge. For thus do We reward those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence
The lady of the house -wife of the high official- where he lived, tried to induce him to surrender his chastity; she closed the doors and said to him: "Come to me". But he said: "Allah forbid, He is my Creator; He has been kind to me, He delivered me from harm and gave me a good home and my master gave me a hearty welcome and a hospitable reception in his house; no, but never shall heaven prosper the wrongful of actions
She had a passionate and libidinous desire of him, a desire she meant to bring to effect physically, and he had a desire of her, a desire that was psychical. It might have been physical, had he not felt Allah in his bosom and the internal recognition of the moral quality of one's motives and actions approving the right and condemning the wrong. We stirred his mind and his heart to live in the conscientious practice of all that is good so that We guard him from evil and immorality; He was indeed one of Our sincere worshippers
To escape the threatened evil he ran to the door: as she chased him she could only reach the hack of his garment, and in his struggle to advance forward, the back of his garment was torn. The master was just coming in and they all met at the door. To justify her action and have her revenge, she said to her husband: "What punishment should be appropriate for someone who tried to assail your wife's virtue but that he be imprisoned or suffers a condign punishment
He -Yusuf- said: "She tried to incite me to an immoral act,". When the family gathered to judge the case, one of them wisely said: "if his garment is torn at the front, then she is in the right and the truth is on her side, and" he is lying
And", he added, "if his garment is torn at the back then she is lying and he has fact upon his side
When her husband saw the garment torn at the back, he said: " This is one of your intrigues, you women; potent indeed is your cunning which you take for a sinister and crooked wisdom
Yusuf", he continued, "let go this incident, and you, my wife, invoke Allah's forgiveness; you were indeed in the wrong
The rumour circulated among some women -the society- in the city. They said: "The wife of the court officer solicits her slave; she is much enamoured of him and inflamed with love; we see that she is indeed vitiated by error
When she heard of their evil intent aggravating her guilt, she invited them to her house and gave them a banquet. The seats were propped up with cushions, the table was set with delightful food and table knives were put in place, one for each. When they were served with the course whereat they use the knives, she ordered him –Yusuf- to come into the room. When the women saw him they were overwhelmed with wonder and they marvelled at his exceptional good looks with profound admiration to the extent that they missed the fruit and wounded their hands. They exclaimed " Allah forbid this is not a mortal; he is none other than a highly impressive, stately and distinguished angel
There and then, she said to them: "This is he on whose account you reproved me." "I wanted him to fulfill my desire but he refused, and unless he submits to my command and does what I want, he shall be put in prison and be incensed with multiplied humiliations
O Allah, my Creator," Said Yusuf, "l would rather be imprisoned than submit to their evil desire; and unless O Allah, You keep their intrigues away from me, I may succumb to their temptation and be one of these wrongful of actions
Allah responded to his invocation and kept their cunning away from him; He is indeed AL-Sami' (the Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and AL-'Alim (the Omniscient)
But they -the men- thought it would be in the best interests of all concerned that he be put in prison for a while, albeit they saw all the signs confirming his innocence
Along with Yusuf, two young men serving in the court were dismissed and put in prison. Each of them had a dream. One of them saw himself pressing grapes to make wine and the other saw himself carrying bread on his head and the birds were eating therefrom. Impressed by Yusuf's appearance which they thought was conformable to reason and piety, they asked him: "Can you reveal to us the significance of these dreams! We do see you a man of piety and we see in you virtue in its true signification
Rest assured", he said, before food is brought to you, I will have informed you of the interpretation of your dreams. This is a part of the divine knowledge Allah, my Creator has imparted to me in consequence of conforming my will to His will. I have forsaken the system of faith of a people who deny Allah and refuse to acknowledge the truth of the Hereafter
I followed the system of faith and worship of my fathers Ibrahim, Ishaq and Ya'qub. It was never befitting that we should incorporate with Allah other deities, this is His grace abounding in us and in mankind but most people are not impelled with the feeling of gratitude
Fellow - inmates", he said, "do you honestly believe that such an immense universe could be controlled with such precision by a group of creatures diverse in kind, nature and character or by Allah AL-Wahid (the One and only) Who is AL- Qahhar (the Omnipotent, Absolute and Irresistible)
In fact," he added, "those whom you worship besides Him are but names of objects you and your fathers have designated as gods; a system of faith and worship Allah has never authorized. Indeed, decision, command and judgement are asserted as Allah's own, He ordained that you worship no one but Him. This is the right system of faith and worship but most people do not perceive this fact
Fellow prisoners said Yusuf, "Now, you shall have the interpretation of your dreams": "As to the fellow pressing grapes, he will be released and restored to his position and will serve his master -the king- with wine, whereas the other will be crucified and the vultures will prey upon his head. There, the die is cast concerning your enquiry
Then said he to the inmate whom he thought would be released: "Mention my name and my story, O fellow, to the king when you are in his presence." But in the midst of the court he -the servant- yielded to the lower part of his nature which is guided by AL-Shaytan and forgot to mention to the king the story of his fellow prisoner. By consequence, Yusuf remained in confinement for a few years - said to be not less than three years
And for once said the king to his retinue: "I saw in my dream seven fat cows eaten by seven lean and emaciated ones, and seven green ears of corn and seven others dry. Give me O counselors an opinion as it seems to you on that sense impression I had in my sleep if you are well versed in interpreting dreams
These are nothing but confused dreams," they said, "nor are we conversant with the interpretation of dreams
There and then did Yusuf's fellow prisoner who heard of the king's dream remember in the end Yusuf and his story. He said: "Permit me to withdraw and give me permission to go to where I can get you the right and true information
He asked: "Yusuf; O man of righteousness and truth, reveal to us this dream and what it prefigures: Seven fat cows were eaten by seven lean and emaciated ones, and seven green ears of corn together with seven dry ones." " Give me your opinion so that I go back to the people and inform them of what they should expect
Yusuf did not only tell him of what people should expect but also suggested the safe measures to be taken. He said: "You shall sow the land in diligent labouring and when it is the season for reaping and gathering in the ripened grain, leave it in its ears and lay it up in store except a little which you will eat
Following this episode, there shall come seven droughty years consuming all that you have saved except the little which you have to use for seed
Then, there follows a year in which people shall rejoice at the abundance of rain and at the yield of grape-vines and other juicy and oily trees and they shall be busy pressing juices and extracting oils
The king, now pleased, said: "Bring him to me." When the king's messenger went to fetch him, Yusuf with just confidence, said to the messenger.: "Go back to your master and ask him to re open my case and question the women who wounded their hands at the banquet and what did they have in mind to be up to trap! "Allah, my creator is indeed fully aware of their cunning
There and then did the king summon the women and question them. He asked: "What was your purpose and intention when you tried to solicit Yusuf?" They said: "Allah forbid, we have never known him to be morally depraved". The court official's wife, now being brought to her senses said: "Now that the truth transpired, it was I who solicited him and he has indeed been telling the truth
I declare the truth", she added, "so that he knows that I did not advantage myself of his absence and betray him or relate to him falsehood. Allah does not cause the cunning of the deceitful and the dishonest attain its end
I'm not trying", she said, "to vindicate my wrong nor do I absolve myself of the guilt which resided in my intention. One's ego inclines one to propound evil except those who are graced with Allah's mercy, and Providence their guide; Allah, my Creator, is indeed Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
There and then did the king command that Yusuf be brought to him; he said: "I will use him as my councillor and exclusively my own". When Yusuf was granted audience with the king, the king said to him: "You are now held precious in the realm's esteem and you are granted security and authority
There, Yusuf said: "Now, O king, that you have faith in me, then entrust ''me with the granaries and the storehouses of the agricultural and natural products of the land and with the treasuries of the realm, and you shall find me trustworthy and capable of guarding the interests of the kingdom and knowing how to manage and administer affairs cleverly
Thus did We firmly establish Yusuf in the land where he could extend his power and jurisdiction wherever he willed. We bestow our mercy on whom We will and never do We annul, withhold or withdraw the fruit people are entitled to reap from deeds of wisdom and piety
Moreover, the reward Hereafter shall be far better; it falls to those who recognized Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and constantly entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him
They went to the man in charge of the granaries -Yusuf- who knew them while they failed to recognize him
He supplied them with their requirement of corn; he talked with them acting as if he did not know they had a half brother he said to them: "So, you have a brother through your father. Bring him to me; do you not see that I dispense the measure to the full and that I afford welcome and extend the most generous hospitality to guests and visitors
If you do not bring him," he added, "I will deny you the provision of corn which you need, nor will you be allowed to come near me
They said to him: "we will talk his father into our cause and persuade him into sending him with us and rest assured that that we will certainly do
There and then said Yusuf to his attendants who rendered the service: "Put back their money -which they paid for the corn- into their saddle-bags; they may recognize it when they go back to their people and hopefully be encouraged to come back
When they returned to their father, they said to him: "O father we have been threatened with the denial of future corn-measures unless we be accompanied by our brother –Benjamin-, therefore, we beg you to send him with us so that we can get our supply of corn, and we solemnly promise to guard him home
The father said: "Shall I entrust him to you just as I entrusted his brother -Yusuf- to you before! Allah is He Who is the Tutelary Guardian and He is the most capable of extending mercy
But when they unloaded and opened their bags, they found their money had been refunded to them and there, they said: "Look O father, what more do we want! There is our money; it has been returned to us; we will provision our family, guard our brother and add a camel's load good at need; It is but a small quantity
The father said: "I will not send him –Benjamin- with you until you have given me a binding oath with a solemn appeal to Allah in witness that you shall bring him back to me unless you are surrounded ,,. Having made an oath to him, he said to them: "There, shall Allah be our witness Who stands guard over what we discourse
He -Ya'qub- in a word with grace divine imbued, advised his sons ," not to make entry through the same gate. He said to them: " O my sons, do not all enter by the same gate but segregate yourselves from one another and enter by different gates. Not that I will deprecate a misfortune that Allah has meant to befall you, it is not in mortals to command success." "Allah is He Who has the command; in Him do I trust and in Him must all the faithful put their trust
Albeit they entered in the manner conformable to their father's advice, it did not mean that they would have escaped a misfortune decreed by Allah, but it was only a notion in Ya'qub's mind wherefore his reason was satisfied. He was imbued with divine knowledge We had imparted to him, but most people are not so imbued nor do they perceive this fact
When they came to where Yusuf was, he took his full brother -Benjamin- by his side, and in a manner designed to escape observation, he declared to him his identity and actuated him with the feeling of confidence and said to him: "Do not grieve at heart over what their minds and souls had impelled them to do
When he was supplying them with their requirement of corn, the attendants, who were instructed earlier, put the king's cup in his brother Benjamin's saddle-bag. As all of them started to journey homeward, an announcer declared larceny; he said: "O you travellers, you are thieves
The brothers turned back and asked: "What is it that you have lost
The attendants said: "We lost the king's cup, and we promise to reward whoever finds it a camel's load of corn", and, said the foreman, "I am, to this effect, the guarantor
The brothers said: "By Allah! you people know that we did not come here to cause mischief or create discord, nor are we disposed to such conduct
The attendants said: "What penalty then shall be incurred on him who is found guilty of theft if it be established that you are lying
Being sure of their innocence-, the brothers said: "He who is found guilty of theft shall have to pay for it or else be the property of the state, and it serves him right; for thus do we treat (in Jewish Can'an) the wrongful of actions
He –Yusuf- began the search with their sacks before searching that of his brother -Benjamin-, then he brought it out of Benjamin's saddle bags. Thus did We design a stratagem for Yusuf to outwit his brothers according to the inspired plan. He could not have detained his brother -Benjamin- by exercising judicial authority not conformable to the statutes of the realm, nor could he have applied the Jewish law of full restitution for the theft or the enslavement by the state unless Allah had willed. So it was. We raise whom We will to higher ranks and exalt them in dignity, wisdom and power. Above every one having mastery of knowledge, there is one who is endowed with more substantial knowledge; and above every one whose sum of knowledge with grace divine imbued there is AL-'Alim (the All-Knowing, the Omniscient)
There and then said the brothers, adding insult to injury: "If he has appropriated dishonestly something belonging to someone else, a brother of his had committed theft aforetime." Yusuf swallowed his resentment and kept it down, and in words spoken aside he said: "You went further and fared worse; it shall go bad with you here and worse Hereafter, and Allah knows every falsity you devise
Yusuf said: "O you noble one, he has a father who is carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life. Take one of us in his stead, we do see you a man of piety and we see in you virtue in its true signification
Allah forbid", said Yusuf, "that we should take to our custody but him with whom we found our personal property or else we will be wrongful of actions
When they lost hope of pursuading him to change his position, they were reticent about their intentions wherefore they withdrew and conferred in secret: "Do you not know", said their eldest, "or have you forgotten that your father has bound you by an oath with a solemn appeal to Allah! what of your sense of guilt of negligence and want of reasonable care which has bereaved our father of his son Yusuf. Therefore, I have resolved never to depart from hence until my father has permitted me to do so or Allah has determined me on a course of action; He gives the law whereas all other judges just interpret it
Go back to your father", he added, and say to him: your son -Benjamin- has committed a theft and we were associated with the event and we only relate what we saw with our own eyes; and when we bound ourselves by the vow, we did not indulge in prophecy to foretell future events or realize the unseen
If you are in doubt of what we relate to you," they added, "then you may send whom you trust to the city whereat we were, to inquire in the matter of the larceny, and you may also ask the people with whom we travelled, and rest assured that we are telling the truth and nothing but the truth
Ya'qub said: " Indeed your minds and souls have enticed you to do something evil and impelled you to feign this tale; may Allah bring them all back to me; He is indeed AL-'Alim and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
He withdrew away from them and retired from their society, weeping and expressing his feeling of grief aroused by the loss of Yusuf. He said: " what a pity it is to lose Yusuf! " and he felt profound grief and mourned passionately to the extent that his eyes turned opaque and impenetrable to sight in the train of his mental pain and deep sorrow
His sons said to him: "For heaven's sake, shall you keep on recalling Yusuf to your memory with distressed mind and deep sorrow and weep out your eyes and heart until you are consumed by disease or perish in the wreck of sorrow
I only exercise my mind in thought", he said, "and express my grief and deep sorrow to Allah, and I know from Allah what you my sons do not know
My sons " he added: "go back to your older brother and feel all of you after Yusuf and his brother -Benjamin- and do not nurse despair nor give up hope of Allah's mercy. Indeed no one despairs of Allah's mercy but those who do not pin their faith to Him nor do they justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will
When the brothers went back and joined the eldest brother and were granted audience of the vizier –Yusuf-, they said to him, appealing to his charity: "O noble one we and our family have had a severe touch of misfortunes and the famine has levied distress upon us, and we have brought the little we could afford in exchange for the corn we need. We seek your kindness and your benevolence for the alleviation of our mental and physical distress. We should be grateful indeed if you would give us the full measure of corn and consider the extra you add as charitable alms comforting the poor; blessed indeed is he that considers the poor, for Allah rewards the benevolent
Yusuf then said: "Do you recall what you did to Yusuf and his brother. You probably did not realize the danger and the consequence of what you were doing and you did it foolhardily
They said: "Indeed you are Yusuf, are you not!" "Indeed I am," said Yusuf, "and this is my brother –Benjamin-. Allah has graced us with His divine favour and benediction, and conferred on us prosperity, for he who entertains the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and be unwearied in the face of difficulties and able to endure evil shall be greatly rewarded. Allah does not annul, withhold or withdraw the fruit people are entitled to reap from their deeds of wisdom and piety
Goodness", they said, "indeed Allah has taken you by preference out of all of us and exalted you in status, rank and fortune and characterized you by impressive disposition." "We do acknowledge our sinful deed and confess ourselves to Allah with full purpose of amendment of life
Today" said, Yusuf: "I cannot blame you to weep, nor do I reproach you. To err is human, to forgive, divine. Allah forgive you, for to Him belong mercy and forgiveness; He is the most Merciful of all those who exercise mercy
Go back with this shirt of mine", he added, "and lay it on my father's face. He will recover his sight, and bring me all the members of your family
When the caravan was on its way homeward, Ya'qab, inspirited with the divine prerogative of intuition, had a presentiment of the event that was about to happen. He said: "I do perceive Yusuf's scent in the wind, albeit you people might think I have lost my mind
But those who were around him said to him: "By Allah, you still live in your old perplexity and confused state of mind
But when the harbinger of good presage -the eldest brother- reached home, and laid Yusuf's shirt on his father's face; there did Ya'qab recover his faculty of sight. and thus he exclaimed: "Did I not tell you that I know from Allah what you people do not know
There said the ten –guilty- sons to their father: "O father, invoke Allah's forgiveness on our behalf for what We committed of sinful deeds; we were indeed wrongful of actions
The father said: "I will invoke Allah's forgiveness; on your behalf, my Creator is indeed AL-Ghafur (the Forgiving) AL-Rahim (the Merciful)
When they all went to Egypt and were granted audience of Yusuf, he took his parents (father and stepmother- aunt who fostered him-) beside him and he said to them: "You are very welcome to reenter into Egypt where you make abode, Allah willing, safe and secure
And he raised aloft his parents to his -the vizier's- seat of dignity and Authority and there and then did all of them bow to the ground in respect, reverence and admiration. There, said Yusuf to his father: "O father, this is the interpretation of my vision which was brought before my mind's eyes during sleep, and Allah has verified it and made it come true". "He was gracious to me; He brought to effect my release from prison and your emigration from the desert in Can'an to settle in the city in Egypt after AL-Shaytan had sown malevolence and ill-will in my brothers' bosoms against me". "Indeed Allah, my Creator, moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform as He will; He is indeed AL-'Alim and AL-Hakim
To express his gratitude to Allah, he -Yusuf- came out with an invocatory prayer, thus: "O Allah, my Creator, You have graced me with pre-eminence in respect of power, dominion and authority, and You have imparted to me the knowledge of interpreting visions and what they prefigure of future events; You are the Creator, Who generated the heavens and the earth; You are my Tutelary Guardian here and Hereafter." "Disembody my soul, O Allah, impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and join me to those whose deeds had been imprinted with wisdom and piety
Such narrative as We have inspired to you O Muhammad is an epitome of the chief points of a larger invisible work embracing unseen forces and motives, thoughts and feelings, complications and results not usually seen or perceived by people but win through in the end as Allah has planned. Nor were you O Muhammad in their circles when they ( the brothers, the retinue and the women resolved unanimously to accomplish what they had maliciously schemed)
Nor are most people moved by the convincing divine signs and marvels, expositions and illustrations to exercise spiritual apprehension of divine truths nor do they justify faith as a conviction operative on their character and will, even though you Muhammad are full of keen desire to guide them into all truth
In fact you never ask them for a price nor do you strike a bargain with them for advantaging them of divine knowledge and practical divinity cited in the Quran which is but a divine illumination and enlightenment revealed to guide mankind into all truth
Countless are the convincing divine signs in the heavens and the earth but in some way people go by them unwilling to open their minds' eyes
Nor do most of them recognize Allah without incorporating with Him other deities
Are they certain in their minds that they are secure against a destructive punishment from the realm of heaven striking them at the root or against their Hereafter which might well be planted unexpectedly and unperceivably in the now
Say to them -the infidels-: "This is my way of presenting divine inducements to the people, based on clear and comprehensible evidence; inducements which I, in collaboration with those who follow me, use to invite people to the path of Allah; glory to Him, and extolled are His glorious attributes wherefore never do I incorporate with Him other deities
We never sent Messengers before you O Muhammad whom We inspired, but were men chosen from among the town dwellers whose deeds were natural to man. Have these people not journeyed through the land and looked with their minds' eyes to see what was the end of those who preceded them! Indeed the abode in Paradise is infinitely better for those who had entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah in life below; can you people not reflect
Our Messengers O Muhammad do face hardships and difficulties, adversities and distresses to the extent that they give up hope of their followers' constancy and begin to think that they take them for impostors. There and then the turning point is reached and Our help comes in good time. We deliver whom We will and punish whom We will and never is Our retributive punishment averted from those who grow daily more and more wicked
Indeed there has been an example or a great lesson in the narratives of the Messengers; a lesson lessoning those of intellect into abhorrence of impatience and despair and the abuse of divine faculties. Such narratives as have been disclosed by divine means are not a feigned tales, but an integral part of the Quran corroborating and authoritatively validating all the divine Books revealed before it in time and serving as an excellent interpretation expounding all the statutes and ordinances past and present revealed to all human beings exacting obedience from the whole. It is emblematic of the spirit of truth that guides the faithful into all truth and it is a mercy to those who lift to Allah their inward sight
(Alef), L. (Lam), M. (Meem), R. (Raa), the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, Cannot be emulated. These are divinely discoursed verses of the Book -the Quran- distinctly indicating that all that has been revealed to you O Muhammad from Allah, your Creator, is the truth guiding into all truth, but peoples' hearts dare rise defiant against Allah and most of them are unwilling to open their minds' eyes or their hearts' ears
Allah, the Omnipotent, is He Who raised the heavens with its spheres lying above or outside of each other inlaid with heavenly bodies superstructures that are kept aloft without pillars or visible means* of support that you people can see, then set He Himself on the Throne of Supremacy and dominion, of grace and mercy, and reduced the sun** and the moon to a state of subserviency. Each describing its orbit for a determined period of time. He conducts all affairs and expounds His revelations and clearly displays His cosmic signs to the mind and renders His discourse readily understood so that you people may hopefully realize that you shall inevitably assemble before Him, at the predetermined point of time
He is it Who extended the earth spreading it out and therein He placed mountains in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, and rivers with copious streams of fresh water flowing in channels, and of all and each fruit did He produce a pair, male and female -with stamens and pistils, uni and bisexual. He enshrouded the day with the veil of the night. Indeed here, there and everywhere are signs with prodigies emblematic of Omnipotence and Authority sensed by those who consider matters and ponder their cause
And in the earth are areas bordering each other, and orchards of vines and edible grain and palm trees bearing clusters of dates moulded on one stem or on more than one stem arising from the same root, alimented with the same water from the same source, yet We make the produce of one unlike that of the other in quality and quantity and We distinguish some in taste upon others. Indeed, here, there and everywhere are signs with prodigies emblematic of Omnipotence and Authority sensed by those who view facts with their minds' eyes
What strikes you with wonder is their astonishment that is mingled with perplexity and bewildered curiosity. They say: "Do you believe that after we have been reduced to dust, we will be restored to life and be created anew!". This is indeed flat blasphemy thought and felt by those who decisively deny Allah, and these are they who shall be fettered with the chains round their necks, and these are the inmates of Hell wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering
They defiantly ask you -O Muhammad- to hasten the promised punishment instead of searching out the truth and be hopeful of Allah's mercy, albeit they heard of the typical instances of the past, forming particular cases of a principle and signal instances of punishment. Nonetheless, Allah, your Creator, is indeed Forgiving. He extends His mercy and forgiveness to people despite their wrongful actions, but also, Allah, punishes severely
Yet the infidels defiantly say: "If only a sign other than the Quran be revealed to him to evince both his wisdom and the truth of his mission!". But you are only a spectacle and a warning, and to every nation did Allah send a Messenger with the truth that guides into all truth
Allah, the Omniscient, knows what every female -human and animal- bears in her womb and what the wombs would lose or gain. To every created being -material or immaterial- did Allah prescribe the extent and quality, the degree and the proportion according with its intended measure
He is Omniscient of what the breasts store of thoughts and feelings and of what they forge. He has cognizance and holds prescience of what is conversed secretly and uttered below the breath and of what is suggested secretly to the mind. He is well acquainted with the visible and the seen and with what is avowed openly and openly disclosed and with all that is uttered loudly and with all that is being said. He is uniquely and imposingly the Great and He is infinitely far above the whole and all in all
Indeed, everything that is said or done comes instantaneously to His knowledge whether it be by those of you who do not express their thoughts m words or utter them below their breath or by those of you whose vocal expression is openly avowed, and whether it be said or done by the one who hides under the veil of night or by the other who moves about in daylight
Each and everyone has a succession of guardian angels guarding the whole on the fore and the back side upon Allah's high behest. Allah does not change the state of life of a given nation until they have changed the state of their innermost being. And when it is His will that a people be stricken with a misfortune or be wedded to a calamity, no expedient whatever nor anyone of singular ingenuity can avert it, and besides Him they have no tutelary protector
He is it Who exhibits to view the lightening -the electrical discharges between groups of clouds or between the clouds and the ground- which actuate you people with the feeling of fear. It might bring suffering, strike one dead or engender a cyclonic storm. Also with the feeling of hope of rainfalls to revive the land that has been pined with drought- and He is it Who engenders the thick clouds, the cumulus and the cumulus nimbus
And thunder, like the rest of His creation, as it declares itself, reverberates His praises, and so do the angels who stand under His awe with dread mingled with veneration and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him. He sends the engendered thunderbolts wherever He wills to strike therewith whom He will. Yet they -the infidels- argue against Allah and they are ready to argue than to obey Him when He is the Omnipotent and the Almighty Who strikes at the root
The spirit of truth that guides into all truth is asserted as Allah's own, whereas those objects they worship and invoke besides Him do not respond to them anymore than the thirsty who stretches out his hand to lift water to his gaping mouth but it never reaches his mouth. Indeed the system of faith and worship practiced by the infidels is simply worthless and leads them to the loss in the of error
To Allah Who controls the fate of all, do all beings, the material and the immaterial, in the heavens and on earth submit to His government and to His supreme controlling and influencing power willingly or unwillingly. So do the shadows they cast on the ground or on a surface by the intercepting sun rays fore and afternoon, and other luminary in the hull of the eve
Ask them O Muhammad: "Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth!" and say to them: "It is Allah". and ask them: "Have you taken besides Him other deities who have no control over what befalls You of good or harm!". Ask them: "Do you compare the one without the sense of sight or who lacks spiritual perception with the other who perceives objects by sight or perceives mentally and apprehends by thought ! " "Does darkness or want of spiritual or intellectual sight compare with light or spiritual enlightenment?". Or did those whom they incorporate with Allah call into existence or form out of nothingness any creature, animate or inanimate, identical with any of those created by Allah, to the extent that they cannot tell the difference! Say to them: "It is Allah Who is the Creator of the whole and of all in all; He is the One and only Ilah, the Supreme controlling and influencing power inherent in the whole and in all in all
He sends the rain-water from the floor of the vault of heaven and there it is conveyed along channels of various capacities in due measure. Where the torrent flows, it drives before it unworthy matter and impurities floating on the surface gathering into a heap of froth resembling aptly the foamy admixture and impurities mounting to the surface of the heated ores for the separation of precious metals used for ornaments and other uses. Thus does Allah give examples with allegorical representations of truth and falsehood. As to the froth and the scum, they are rejected and disappear, whereas what is profitable to the people remains behind on earth. Thus does Allah describe a subject under the guise of some other subject of aptly suggestive resemblance
Those who respond favourably to Allah, the Creator, and lift to Him their inward sight are the recipients of Allah's blessings and gratifying rewards, whereas those who do not respond and their hearts dare rise defiant against Him were born to be losers. If they have profuse affluence of all things on earth and twice as much, they would gladly give it in expiation of their guilt at Judgment, but far from it. These and their like must expect a manifest discomfort of body and mind. Much misery and hardship shall be the insignia of their reckoning when the account of their life and conduct is rendered at Judgment. Their abode is Hell and evil indeed is the bed they have made for themselves
Does he who is certain of the truth of your mission O Muhammad and knows that all that has been revealed to you from Allah, your Creator, is the truth guiding into all truth, compare with him who lacks intellectual and spiritual perception! Indeed, those who bear Allah in mind are people of insight
who make their prayer unto Allah, their Creator, and to Him they render the vow, and they do not breach a legal or a moral bond nor an obligation or a promise
who join together humanity and policy and the two hands in fidelity and join all that Allah has ordained be joined together, and stand in awe of Allah with dread mingled with veneration and they fear the misery and hardship experienced at Judgement
who possess their souls in patience purposed to fulfill their obligation to Allah and to satisfy their conscience and their hearts
Enjoying themselves in the Gardens of Eden with peace of mind and blissful habitation. They are heartily welcomed together with those who are righteous among their parents, their mates and their progeny, and there, shall they be visited by the angels who make entry through every gate
To bid them welcome and greet them with the welcoming salute: "Peace be upon you for your patience and endurance; how excellent and how blissful is this final and eternal abode
Those who do not fulfill their covenant with Allah after they have solemnly vowed to Him to do what has been enjoined, disjoining humanity and policy instead of joining them, separating the two hands joining one another in fidelity, disjoining all that Allah has ordained be joined together and making mischief on earth or creating discord were born to be losers. These and such persons have come within the measure of Allah 's wrath, and in their final abode they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering
Allah gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously on whom He will and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will. The worldly - minded - rejoice beyond a common joy with life here below afore that Hereafter. But how little are the material and the immaterial things that minister to enjoyment and content here as compared with Hereafter
Yet the infidels insolently say: "If only a sign other than the Quran be revealed to him from Allah, his Creator, to evince both his wisdom and the truth of his mission! Say to them: "Indeed, Allah misleads whom He pleases and He guides those who lift to Him their inward sight
Their hearts and minds become quiet and calm at the thought of Allah. Indeed, at the thought of Allah do hearts and minds find peace, repose and tranquility
Those who recognize Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety are they whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand. Blessed are they with the beatitude of heaven, and eternity in perpetual bliss is asserted as their own
Thus have We sent you O Muhammad to a people before whom generations who received Messengers have passed away, so that you recite to them Our divine revelations and narrate to them all that We have inspired to you, notwithstanding that they deny Allah, AL-Rahman and His mercy, and their hearts dare rise defiant against Him. Say to them: "He is Allah, my Creator, there is no Ilah but He; in Him do I trust and to Him do I in lowliest plight repentant stand and unto Him do I set my thought
And if there be a discourse that has a firm place in the realm of fact, a discourse by which mountains could be set in motion or the earth be torn apart or the dead be spoken to it would have been this Quran But, command, control, domination and decision are asserted as Allah's own. Further, do those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand not realize that had Allah willed He could have guided mankind as a whole to His path of righteousness! Nonetheless, those whose hearts dare rise defiant against Allah -shall not cease to be bombarded with disaster hitting them directly in requital of their evil deeds or hits close enough to their homes -as a deterrent- until Allah's promised punishment comes to pass. Allah never fails to keep His promise
Messengers sent before you O Muhammad were also bombarded with foul epithets. The infidels mocked them and gave them a lick with the rough side of their tongues, and called them everything they could lay their tongues to. But despite their wickedness, I put their punishment in respite, then I cast them down from a position of prosperity and power and brought them to ruin, and how unbearable was the retribution
Does he who stands guard over every soul, and His sentinel angels record every deed that is done or in the making or suggested secretly to the mind and to whose knowledge everything comes instantaneously, compare with a false object of worship or a helpless creature or dumb idols whom they called holy gods! Yet they still incorporate with Allah other deities. Say to them: "Name them; or do you inform Allah of objects on earth He has no knowledge of! the fact is that the infidels' intrigues and cunning allured them to brighter worlds and led them, under the vexations of their minds, to a path other than that of righteousness. And he whom Allah misguides shall find no one to guide him thereto
They must expect punishment in this world, and worse shall be the punishment in the world-to-come, and besides Allah no one can afford them protection
To represent in words the Paradise promised those who lift to Allah their inward sight, it is the Garden of bliss and delight, of protection, security and peace of mind beneath which rivers flow. Its fruits and its glory are eternal and therein they will have passed through nature to eternity of joy. This is the destination of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, whereas the intended end of those who deny Him is the fire of Hell
Ahl AL-Kitab (The People of the Book) -the Jews- who lift to Allah their inward sight rejoice at the Quran and at all that has been revealed to you O Muhammad They find in it an extension of the basic principles of the Oneness of Allah, the validation of previous Scriptures and the unity of purpose, feeling and action. But among the sects are those who receive a part of the Quran with consenting mind and reject other parts not falling in with their vain desires. Say to them: "I have been commanded to worship Allah and never to incorporate with Him other deities and to present inducements to the people to turn to Him; and to Him shall all return
And thus did We reveal it -the Quran- as the constitution of Our Sovereign power discoursed in Arabic literary form. And should you Muhammad be inclined to please them -the sects- and respond to their desires after divine knowledge has been imparted to you, then you will have lost Allah's tutelary guardianship and protection
We sent Messengers before you O Muhammad who were human and We entered them into matrimony and We gave them a progeny, and it was not for any of them to work a miracle of his own, their miracles were worked and Authorized by Allah and were imparted to them as He ordained. Every period of time has its divine Book and appropriate constitution
Allah deletes -what becomes of secondary character- as He wills and He confirms what He will, and this and that are put on record in the archetypal Book in the realm of Heaven
And We either show you O Muhammad in your life time some part of the retributive punishment We promised them or occasion your death before. You are only responsible for relating the divine message and We are responsible for their trial in Day of judgement
Do they -the infidels- not see that We reduce the; land or territory in their possession and add it to the Muslims territory by progressive conquests of its outlying borders! And Allah is He Who commands, and no one shall ever be able to reverse His judicial decision;He is swift indeed in putting the law in execution
Their predecessors schemed and conspired and the wicked plotted against the just, but who can get the better of Allah's plans or defeat His predetermined events? He is the Master Who controls all plans at will. He has omniscience and holds prescience of all that each soul earns of qualities, actions and deeds, The day shall come when the infidels realize with much regrets to whom belongs eternity in the heavenly and blissful abode
Thus still, the infidels say to you-: "You are not sent by Allah nor are you charged with a message from Him to mankind". Say to them: " Good enough for me is Allah as a witness of my actions and of your actions. He knows the truth of the Book -the Quran- and of every Book and so do those who apply their minds to the acquisition of learning and exercise thought and deliberation in reading the Book
(Alef), L. (Lam), R. (Raa), the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue cannot be emulated. A Book -the Quran- the Source of enlightenment - We have revealed it to you O Muhammad to guide people into all truth and to lead them, Allah willing, out of darkness and superstitions of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment, and to direct them to the path of righteousness, the path of Allah, the AL-Aziz (Almighty) and AL-Hamid (to Whom are extolled the glorious attributes)
Allah, to Whom belong the whole and all in all in the heavens and on earth; woe betide the infidels who deny Him. They shall pass through nature to eternal suffering
Those worldly-minded who chose to go by the world below afore the Hereafter and did not seek Grace to guide their choice and stood in the way to prevent Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth making it their aim to pervert the truth and crook the path of righteousness to their own ends were born to be losers. These and their like are indeed lost in the maze of error
We never sent a Messenger, to a people, who did not master their tongue so that he makes himself understood, distinctly expressing all that is meant leaving nothing merely implied. There and then does Allah misguide whom He will and guides to His path of righteousness whom He will, and He is the AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
We sent Mussa (Moses) with Our revelations and signs pointing to Allah's Authority and We commanded him to guide his people into all truth and lead them out of darkness and superstitions of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment We enjoined him to remind them of the eventful days of Allah, His means of trail and His mode of action
And there, did Mussa say to them: "My people, remember Allah's grace and blessings He imparted to you". He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh who laid upon you cruel impositions and intolerable torment. They brutally slaughtered your sons and spared your women, and this was indeed a severe but a sure test of your actions and reactions echoing your true beliefs and the prevalent inclination among you
And in consequence did Allah, your Creator, proclaim, thus: "If you actuate yourselves with the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness I will make all grace abound in you, but should you show ungratefulness, then you must realize that My punishment* is indeed severe
And Mussa added: "should you be ungrateful and, together with all those domiciled on earth, you be inclined to disobedience, then you must realize that Allah is Ghaniyun (Absolute and Independent) and Hamidun (extolled are His glorious attributes)
Have you people not been informed of what became of your predecessors: the people of Nuh (Noah) and those of 'Ad and the people of Thamud and their successors whom no one knows but Allah! Their Messengers brought them clear and plain revelations guiding out of darkness and superstitions of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment but they drew their hands across their lips to menace with their mouths their refusal to accept the divine message and said: "We flatly deny the truth of your mission and we are in doubt of the system of faith which you invite us to follow. It excites suspicion
Their Messengers said to them: Do you people involve Allah in doubt when it is He who generated the heavens and the earth and brought them into existence and He invites you to His system of faith and worship so that you qualify to receive His blessings and the forgiveness of your sins! He grants you respite to confess yourselves mistaken and your punishment He puts in respite up to a predetermined point of time. They said: "But you are simply mortals like us and you just want us to turn our backs upon the gods our fathers held in holy reverence and veneration! Give us then solid evidence that convinces our minds and tends to prove the conclusion
Their Messengers said to them: "But we are only mortals like you and Allah imparts His grace to those of His worshippers whom He chooses as He will, and it is not for us nor is it within our power to present you with the evidence but with Allah's delegated power and authorization. And in Allah do those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand put their trust
And why should we not put our trust in Allah when He has guided us to the paths We should tread in our course of action and in our line of conduct, line of thought and argument and to all the paths of life. The paths leading us to His path of righteousness and inducing us to connect knowledge with wisdom and our hearts with the spirit of truth and help us endure your foul epithets and unjust affliction! And in Allah should all those who lift to Him their inward sight put their trust
And the infidels insolently and defiantly said to their Messengers: " We will most certainly oust you of your homes and drive you out of our land unless you reverse your course of action and return to our system of faith and worship". But Allah, their Creator, inspired to them confidence and assured them thus: "We will put the wrongful of actions to rout and bring unbearable and irretrievable disaster upon them
And We will install you in their land and settle you therein to make abode after We have reduced them into a useless form. This is a favour We confer only on him who entertains the profound reverence dutiful to Me and regards the moment he assembles before Me with reverence and awe and lays to heart the threatened punishment
The Messengers prayed for victory and the infidels entertained expectation of triumph and suppression of their adversaries -the Muslims-, but the hopes of every transgressor who is self-willed and opinionated are doomed to disappointment
Hell is in his pursuit and offensive boiling water shall be in his aliment
He drinks of it by sips he can hardly swallow but then he shall drink up the dregs of it forever, and over him triumphant death his dart shakes but never shall it strike, and the torment laid upon the damned shall be in his pursuit
Those infidels, who deny Allah, whose physical and mental efforts are not intimately mixed with the spiritual apprehension of divine truths were born to be losers. Their efforts are useless and stand similitude exact of ashes which are exposed to violent high winds scattering them in all directions. They are unable to advantage themselves of what they have accomplished, and this is perversion in the extreme
O man, can you not see with the bodily eyes and with those of your mind that Allah created the heavens and the earth and brought them into existence in truth and in all manner of wisdom and for a valid reason, and if He wills He can do away with you and replace you by a new creation
And this would not be a difficult act for Him to accomplish
And when the whole have emerged from the graves and assembled before Allah at Judgment, the weak who lacked strength of purpose and will shall say to those who were extravagant in their accounts of themselves: "We were your followers; are you now going to carry on our behalf a share of Allah's torment laid upon the damned!" The proud would answer "Had Allah guided us to His path of righteousness, We would have guided you thereto; now it is all the same whether we be impatient or patient, never will we be able to possess our souls nor can we escape
When the die is cast then AL-Shaytan (Satan) shall say to those whose hopes were doomed to disappointment: "Allah had promised you the truth affording expectation of all that is good showing signs of future excellence". "I also promised you and afforded you ground of expectation of all that would seem good and allure you to brighter worlds. But as was expected I broke my promise". "I had no authority over you; I simply presented you with false inducements attracting your attention and influencing your appetites and I led the way". "Therefore do not blame me but you should lay the blame upon yourselves. I cannot help you now nor can you help me either from the torment laid upon the damned. Indeed, I renounced your idea of incorporating me with Allah as a predominant partner aforetime; the wrongful of actions are destined to eternal suffering
But those whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety have been enrolled as the honoured inmates of the beatitude of heaven in blissful gardens beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, Allah willing, greeted by the angels with the customary formula conducive to the feeling of security and peace of mind, "Peace
Do you not see you people how did Allah exemplify the good word of truth! It stands similitude exact of a blessed fruit tree, its roots are firmly implanted and its branches are springing out skyward
It yields its produce, Allah willing, periodically in season; Allah' discourses to people parables by which moral or spiritual relations are typically set forth
Whereas an evil word stands similitude exact of an evil tree; it may flourish to begin with but soon enough it is uprooted from the soil and the surface of the earth. Its roots being loosely implanted, it does not have the strength to grow erect nor does it eventually grow at all
Allah confirms those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues in opinion, action, purpose and in their words of truth expressing their thoughts and corroborating their faith in life here and at judgment Hereafter. Allah misguides the wrongful of actions, and Allah accomplishes what He will
Have you not seen O Muhammad into the way these infidels act! They exchange the efficacious grace of Allah for disobedience and infidelity and set up their people in the abode of perdition
The abode in Hell whereat they be enveloped in flames, and evil indeed is the place wherein they make abode
And they set to Allah objects of worship presumptuously possessing a like degree of quality or attribute and in the same level of dignity, power and excellence and having the same rights or privileges to lead people into error and in the wrong direction. Say to them O Muhammad "Enjoy yourselves and serve the Devil; you have decided your own destiny to the Fire
Say to My servants who have conformed to Islam: "Engage in the act of worship and spend in divine service, secretly or openly of the provisions of life We provisioned them with before the Day comes when there shall be no trading nor friendship
Allah is He, Who created the heavens and the earth and brought them into existence and sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain-water causing the various products to spring up from the soil; products fit to be used as food for human sustenance. He reduced the ships to a state of subjection under your dominion and authority to be buoyant by His invisible acting force producing buoyancy and motion. He ordered the rivers in subservience to your advantage your end
He reduced for you the sun* and the moon** to a state of subserviency, constantly describing their paths and the night and the day were not made to rule but to subserve you where wisdom bears command
And He made all grace abound in you; He gave you of everything you asked for, and if you were to compute the divine favours you wear, you shall find them out of all count; but man is indeed wrong-headed, displaying no gratitude
And for once did Ibrahim express his thoughts in an invocatory prayer thus: "O Allah, my Creator", he said. may I ask You to confer on this town -Macca- security and make it afford a safe retreat and freedom of fear and anxiety, and guard me O Allah, my Creator, and my progeny from idolatry
These objects of worship "O Allah, my Creator, have allured the mind's eyes of the many who strayed from. Your path of righteousness, therefore, he who follows me and submits to Your system of faith and worship shall be an integral part of me, and he who disobeys me shall be left to plead his causes and You decide them; you are Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
O Allah, our Creator, I have made some of my progeny take abode in an uncultivated valley in the vicinity of your Sacrosanct House to engage O Allah in the act of worship. Let the hearts and souls of people, O Allah be moved toward them with tenderness and affection, and provide them with the fruits of the earth, they may hopefully be thankful
You do know O Allah, our Creator, all our thoughts and all that our bosoms conceal and You do know all that we vent in words and all that we reveal, and simply nothing whatsoever escapes Your knowledge be it on earth or in the heavens
My bosom surge up and answers thanks to Allah Who has graced me in My old age with the procreation of Ismail and Ishaq (Isaac). Indeed, Allah, my Creator, is Sami'un (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition and; He responds to the prayer
O Allah, my Creator, help me express my gratitude to You in the act of worship and make me and those, whom you will, of my progeny devout with prayerful minds and expressive of prayer and grant me O Allah, our Creator, my humble request
O Allah, my Creator", he concluded, "extend your mercy and forgiveness to me, to my parents and to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand. In Day of Judgment when all shall answer for their conduct and render an account of their lives
Do not think O Muhammad that Allah is oblivious of the doings of the wrongful of actions. He only postpones their condemnation to punishment to a Day when they stand gazing fixedly with the eyes wide open in horror
They rush at an excessive pace with hearts sinking in their shoes, lifting up their heads in supplication for forgiveness. Their eyes cannot wink, they are fixedly gazed wide open in terror and their hearts are empty of intellect and of all hope
Therefore, warn people O Muhammad of the Day when they are overtaken by Allah's retributive punishment, then the wrongful of actions shall say: "O Allah our Creator, if only You would delay our condemnation to punishment for a term close at hand, we will apprehend the voice from heaven and be in purpose and follow the Messengers" But they shall be told: "Did you not swear before that you shall never suffer loss nor any change in disposition neither in life nor Hereafter
You dwelt in the abode of those* who were wrongful of actions and much did you apprehend the quiet of their cities which was purchased by the ruin of their land and the ultimate wretchedness of both. And We discoursed to you parables by which moral and spiritual relations were typically set forth
Yet, with cleverness in circumventing, they -the Meccan infidels- had recourse to stratagem, but all their cunning they take for a sinister and crooked wisdom comes to Allah's knowledge, notwithstanding that their breastplate of cunning is overreaching that it moves mountains
Therefore do not think O Muhammad that Allah will fall short of keeping His promise to His Messengers; Allah is Azizun (Almighty) indeed; and He justly avenges His own right
Such a retributive punishment shall come into effect on the Day when the planet earth is changed to another planet and the heavens too, and there, they - people- emerge from their graves and assemble before Allah, the One, and only AL-Qahhar (Who subdues all)
There and then shall you see the sinful bound together in fetters
Vested in garments of pitch with their faces shrouded in a veil of flames
And in accord with equity and justice shall Allah requite every soul with what is commensurate with its qualities and worldly deeds
This is a divinely inspired message sent from Allah to His Messenger to use as a warning to the whole and to spread it in the wide circle of the all, they may hopefully realize that He is One Ilah and the matter be weighed by those who lift to Him their inward sight
(Alef), L. (lam) R. (Raa), the Surah opens with these letters introductory from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated. These are divine prosy discoursed verses of the Book and a perspicuous Quran which stands manifest of enlightenment and imparting knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light
Perhaps the Day shall come sooner than expected when those who denied Allah and disobeyed His statutes wish they had conformed to Islam as ordained by Him
Let them feast their senses, their thoughts and their feelings with infidelity and disobedience and experience with delight the pleasure they draw from such a disposition and be fooled by their hopes which they shall come to know and. realize that they are doomed to disappointment
We never destroyed a city, a people or a nation arbitrarily but according to a justified act. There and then their end is being predetermined and unalterably decreed
Nor can a people or a nation hasten their own end of ultimate state earlier than the predetermined due date nor can they delay it either
Acting against their own best interests, they accuse the Messenger of falsehood; they mockingly say to him: "O you who claim to have received the divine message from heaven, you are indeed insane or demoniac
Why then", they add, "you do not bring down the angels to substantiate your claim if indeed you are declaring the truth
They do not realize that We do not send down the angels to satisfy a curiosity. We only send them down for a valid reason and a just cause -to execute Allah's decrees-, and if We do send them down, the infidels shall be annihilated on the spot and no hope shall there be for respite
We have sent down the Quran featuring the virtuous divine message of truth which shall never suffer eclipse nor shall its spiritual power ever be on the wane and its preservation against loss and corruption is indeed Our concern
We sent Messengers before you O Muhammad to the various sects of the distant past who were adherents of different systems of faith and worship
And never did a Messenger present himself to them but suffered malicious mockery and was laughed to scorn
Thus do We picture him in the minds and hearts of the sinful who grow daily more and more wicked
They just refuse to recognize him nor do they accept his message, notwithstanding that Allah's mode of action which has long been pursued in the past for each typical instance forming a particular case of a principle and a signal instance of punishment shall not alter
And if We were to open to them a gate in heaven to provide a free passage so as to admit of their continued ascent into the realm
They would, thus still, say: "This is an eye trap. Our eyes have been confused with drink. In fact we have been bewitched
We established in the heavens mansions or divisions of the ecliptic to be occupied by the moon on successive days and a belt within which the apparent motions of the sun, the moon and principal planets take place - Signs of the Zodiac*- and We adorned them with qualities affording keen pleasure to the sense of sight
And We guarded them and their harmonious setting from disturbing Satanic forces and from those with characteristics befitting AL-Shaytan, the accursed
He who peers inquisitively into the realm to steal whatever comes to his hearing of the secrets or future events is pursued by a flame of fire which does not miss
And the earth did We spread out and stretch* and furnish with mountains placed in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, and therein did We produce and cause to grow a set of every kind whose seeming speaks of interdependence and the bearing of proportion
And We provisioned you thereon with livelihood and We provisioned those creatures for which you are not responsible for furnishing with the necessities of life. -see introduction
No material or immaterial object, an article or a substance of any kind or anything with which anyone is concerned in action or in thought but We have infinite stores thereof, and what We release from all and each and send down to meet the needs is ascertained by due measure
And We send the wind as an agent of fertilization in plants and it impregnates also the clouds and there issues the rain We send down from the floor of the vault of heaven and We afford you aliment therewith and quench your thirst. It is not under your dominion or control that you can lay it up in store
And it is We Who give life and inspirit the property of animate existence and occasion the moment of death and deprive of animate existence, and indeed it is We Who are in the end the inheritors of the heavens and the earth
And We already know those of you whose turn to pay nature's debt comes first, and We already know those of you who would follow
And it is Allah, your Creator, O Muhammad Who shall throng them all at Judgement. He is indeed Hakimun (Wise) and, 'Alimun (Omniseient)
And We created man from dried clay, a product of dark modelling clay that has been polished
And the Jinn did We create earlier from a fiery blast of fervently hot wind
And for once did Allah say to the angels: I am on the point of creating a human from dried clay, the product of dark modelling clay that has been polished
And when I have fashioned it and furnished it with a definite shape and imparted to it My spirit, then prostrate yourselves to him in reverence and admiration
There and then did all the angels cast themselves down prostrate
Except Iblis (AL-Shaytan-to-be) who refused to join those who prostrated themselves in obeisance to Allah
What kept you, O Iblis", Allah Asked, "from joining those who cast themselves down in reverence and admiration
It is not I", Iblis said, "who would cast himself down in reverence to a human whom You created from dried clay, a product of dark modeling clay that has been polished
Then get out of hence", Allah said, " you are dismissed and accursed
And the curse shall pursue you till The Day of Judgment
Then Iblis requested Allah saying: "delay, my condemnation", O Allah till the Day of Resurrection
Reprieve is granted", Allah said, "respiting your condemnation
Till the specified Day on which the point of time has been predetermined
Now, O Allah", Iblis said, that You have destined me and I have erred, I will entangle them with the bird-lime of fleshy passions, mundane vanity and temporalities and I will entice them all to do evil and I will incite idle men to tempt me to tempt them
But not the devout among Your worshippers whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand and they lift to You their inward sight
This is the path", Allah said, "the devout tread. It is the path of righteousness which leads directly to Me
My devout worshippers", Allah continued, "do not come under your authority nor have you the power to influence their conduct and actions; you only have influence over those who follow you and in vanity they waste their days
And Hell is indeed the destination wherein shall they all make their abode
Apprehended in a material sense, it has seven gates through each of which shall enter those appropriated to the degree of suffering that is commensurate with their evil deeds
Whereas those who have always entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah shall be blessed with divine favour. They are destined to make abode in blissful gardens in the beatitude of heaven fountained wits dazzling springs
They will be addressed with expression of good will, thus: "Make entry into Paradise", they are told, "We bid you a hearty welcome wherein you shall live in peace, safe and secure
And We will have erased malevolence from their breasts and injurious events from their memories; now they are an association of brothers spiritually allied to each other, seated on thrones of dignity facing each other
There and then they are not overtaken by fatigue nor shall there be an impression of it upon their minds or their souls nor shall they be asked to leave or depart therefrom
Tell My servants O Muhammad that I am indeed AL-Ghafur (the Forgiving) and AL-Rahim (the Merciful)
and also that My retributive punishment is indeed severe; it is the torment laid upon the damned
And inform their thoughts O Muhammad with the disguised angels who were the guests of Ibrahim
They made entry into his home and greeted him with the expression of good will, "Peace", he recoiled back afraid of them -due to their unusual behaviour
Do not be afraid". They said, " we have some news to break to you. We are here to announce to you the procreation of a son Ishaq (Isaac) who shall be imbued with wisdom and divine know ledge
How can you", said Ibrahim, "intimate to me such news when I have been carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life! Is this an object of a joke that you intimate to me
Never", they said, "but we have intimated to you the truth and therefore do not entertain the idea that the thing which seems hopeless makes you despair of Allah's mercy
Who would despair of Allah's mercy", Ibrahim said, " but those who are lost in the maze of error
And now", Ibrahim said, "what is the errand on which you Messengers have come
We have been sent", the Messengers said, "to a sinful people who grow daily more and more wicked
But not the family of Lut (Lot) all of whom will we save
Excepting his wife whom we have determined that she be among those who shall be left behind to share their destiny
And when the Messengers presented themselves to Lut
He said to them: "You are strangers who are foreign to me
But", said the Messengers, "we have brought you the answer to the problem of those who doubted your mission and denied your divine message
And we have brought you the truth and we conduct ourselves in accordance with the divine standard
You just escort your family", they said, "and take them out of this town at the dead hours of the night hanging on their rear and none of you shall look in the direction from which you are going and keep going to where you are commanded
And We informed him of this decree, thus: "These wicked people shall be uprooted by morning
In the interim, there came the city dwellers displaying their gasp of pleasure and joyous delight at the thought of the presence of young men
These are my guests", said Lut, "I beg of you not to bring shame or discredit upon me
And fear Allah and do not disgrace me
Did we not forbid you", they said "to entertain people in your house and defend your principles
There", said Lut, "you may wed my daughters if you must exercise your libidinous desire
To your life, O prophets" he was told, "they -the wicked- are wandering here and there being deceived by their vain illusive sensuous perception which shall melt when the sun beams glow
And there it was: a single cry* from heaven's realm stirred up a merciless blast which overtook them by sun- rise
And We turned those cities -Sodom and Gomorrah- upside down and rained them with fire and successional brimstones as hard as baked clay
These are indeed divine signs making a deep impression on the minds or senses of those who ponder
And the evidence still stands as a scene of dismal devastation to the travelers (in the neighbourhood of the dead sea between Syria and Arabia)
This is indeed a meaningful sign which is quite impressive to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
Thus much did the woodlanders Madyanites wrong themselves and were wrongful of actions
And in consequence we took just-vengeance on them and both sites stand manifest of the events on a course of travel where people can see
Similarly did the dwellers of the rocky territory -the Thamudites- deny the truth of the divine message conveyed to them by the Messengers and were wrongful of actions
And We presented them with Our signs betokening Omnipotence and Authority but they took objection against them and a dislike
And they were carving the mountains into homes wherein they made abode and enjoyed safety and security
Nonetheless a single cry* from heaven's realm stirred up a merciless rumbling earthly convulsion which overtook them by day light
And so be it, what they gained of skill and enjoyed of safety did not profit them nor help them accomplish a useful purpose
Nor did We create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but in accordance with reason and truth and for just ends. And the Final predetermined Hour is inevitably coming, therefore, forgive O Muhammad your opponent's human instability with gracious intent
For, it is Allah, indeed who is the Creator of the whole and of all in all and He is the AL-'Alim (the Omniscient)
And We have given you O Muhammad seven reiterative dual verses of opening in Allah's Name: in praise, in thanks, in action and in prayer, and the meritorious Quran which is eminently entitled to the designation, the great
Do not direct your sight wistfully O Muhammad at the advantages We gave to some of the unbelievers among the various sects nor grieve at heart for their disobedience to Allah, and be soft in temper and disposition to those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and take them under your wing
And say: "I hereby declare to the wide circle of the all that I am delegated by Allah to make manifest His warning against denying Him and/or His statutes
Just as We had sent down a warning to those who treated Our Scriptures in the way it suited them dividing them into parts, accepting some and rejecting others
And together with the Pagans they used their underhand scheming to discredit the Quran by fragmenting it into parts, labelling some as sheer poetry, some as legendary and others as divinatory, and fed the pilgrims thoughts with their falsehood
But by Allah, your Creator, there shall come the Day when all of them shall have much to answer for
And all their misdeeds shall be laid to their charge
Therefore, you just proclaim Allah's message O Muhammad and publish all that you have been commanded to declare and attach no importance to those who incorporate with Him other deities
We have guarded you from the danger of those who hold the truth in disdain, and maintain your cause against their cunning which they take for a sinister and crooked wisdom
And they incorporate with Allah other deities, but soon shall they know the logical conclusion and experience the losses and injuries which are the consequent of their crimes
And We do know how much does their vain discourse depress your spirits and oppress your thoughts and your feelings
But you just praise Allah, your Creator, and extoll His glorious attributes and join yourself to those who prostrate themselves to Him in reverence and adoration
And worship Allah, your Creator, until the encounter with death which is indeed a matter of certainty
Allah's decree is inevitably coming to pass and so you Pagans need not reproach the Messenger for divine visitation in a sarcastic and insulting way. How foolish of you to cut off your last hope of forgiveness by wishing scornfully that it, be hastened on; glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes; He is infinitely far beyond those whom they incorporate with Him
He sends down the angels with divinely inspired messages on whom He chooses of His worshippers as He will, enjoining them to inform people of the danger of polytheism and relate to them, thus: "There in no Ilah but I, and so entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Me
He has created the heavens and the earth in accordance with reason and truth and for just ends. He is infinitely far beyond those they incorporate with Him
He created the Adamite from a constituent part of fluid that is emitted*, yet he -the Adamite- is more ready to argue than to obey. He brings forward reasons against Allah with a strong, capacious and argumentative mind
And the cattle He created for you to advantage yourselves of their wool for warmth and you make use of them for other purposes, and they are reared to serve as food for alimentation
And they afford you keen pleasure to the sense of sight when you drive them home and when you lead them to pasture
And they carry your burdens to a land you could not have reached but with hardship and severe toil. Allah, your Creator, is indeed Raufun (Compassionate) and Rahimun (Merciful)
And horses, mules and asses did He create for you to ride and to use as an adornment, and He creates what is yet unknown to you
It is Allah Who indicates to you the path to tread, the path of truth guiding into all truth with some deviating from righteousness. And had He willed, He would have guided you all to the one path leading directly to Him
He is It Who sends down the rain-water from the floor of the vault of heaven suitable to drink and instrumental in springing up vegetation for your cattle to feed
And therewith He causes vegetal growth of corn, olives, palm-trees and grapes and of all kinds of fruits. Indeed, all this is emblematic of Almightiness; food for thought taken by those who are disposed to think
And He reduced for you the night and the day, the sun and the moon to a state of subservience, and He ordered the stars and the planets in subservience to your advantage and your end: signs emblematic of Omnipotence and Authority making a deep impression on the minds of those of sound intellect
Next comes all that He distributed to your necessity and advantage of objects of various glorious colours within and without the surface of the earth displaying collective beauty. This is indeed a great sign, breath-taking and highly impressive to those who keep Allah in mind and lift to Him their inward sight
It is He Who made the sea subservient to you to use as a source of aliment and ornaments. You eat of its fresh and tender meat -fish- and wear of its coral and pearls. And you see the ships cleaving its surface and ploughing its billowy waves. They help you accomplish your objects sought after of His bounty to the end that your bosoms may hopefully surge up and answer thanks
And the earth He furnished with firm stays (mountains) placed in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor to stabilize* it lest it should sway you from side to side or in all directions. And He furnished it with rivers and road-ways to use as a guide in your travels from one place to another
And other visible signs together with signs in the heavens -the stars- serving as guide-posts to guide people on land and at sea
Therefore, would He Who creates and brings things into existence out of nothingness be likened to him who simply can never create an entity of any kind! can you people not consider this matter and ponder My cause
And if you were to compute the divine favours you wear, you shall find them out of all count; Allah is indeed Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun
And Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all that you converse secretly or whisper below your breath and of all that you suggest secretly to the mind, and He is well acquainted with all that the bosoms store of thoughts and feelings and with all that they forge, and He knows what you utter loudly and all that is being said
And those whom they invoke besides Him are incapable of creating an entity of any kind. On the contrary, they themselves have been created
Inanimate dumb idols and lifeless objects insensible to feeling and knowing, unaffected by anything specified. They do not perceive resurrection nor when shall their devotees be resurrected
In point of fact, things all around point clearly to you people that your Ilah is absolutely One Eternal Ilah. Those who deny Him simply close their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and exercise inordinate self esteem and pride got the better of their prudence
Allah is indeed fully cognizant of all that they converse secretly or whisper under their breath and of what they suggest secretly to the mind, and of all that they openly declare and of all that is being said. He detests the arrogant exercising inordinate self- esteem
And when they are asked if they knew what Allah has revealed, or if they were referred to some illustration from the Quran, they dismiss it contemptuously with the remark: "Fables of old
Such is the disposition of those who shall bear their burdensome lot at Judgment and the burden of their wrongs in full, in addition to the wrongs of those unlearned whom they misled. Evil indeed is the fate of those who are burdened with wrongs and evil indeed are the wrongs they bear
Potent was the cunning of their predecessors that it justified Allah's retributive punishment. He struck them at the roots of their foundation and their roofs collapsed over their heads and they were unexpectedly reduced to a useless form
And at Judgement they shall be put to shame and be asked about the whereabouts of those whom they once presumed divine and contended in their favour with opposing arguments against Allah's Omnipotence and Authority There and then shall the learned say: "This is the Day when disgrace and torment are laid upon those who presumed upon Providence
It is these who persist in doing wrong and continue firmly in the state of disbelief in Allah until the encounter with the angels of death who disembody their souls. There and then they express their willingness to submit to Allah and learn at last acceptance of their lot and claim they never did wrong. But the angels say to them: "But you did, and Allah is indeed 'Alimun of all you did
And now", they add, "make entry through the gates of Hell wherein you will have passed through nature to eternal suffering. Evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant whose pride got the better of their prudence
So would those who entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah be asked if they knew what Allah, their Creator, has revealed! "All that is truthful and virtuous", they say, "and all that was imparted to us of knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light". These and such persons whose deeds were imprinted with wisdom and piety in life below shall reap the fruits of their piety. Allah bestows on them His prevenient and efficacious grace here and His efficacious grace is far better for them Hereafter, and how excellent and supreme is the heavenly abode of the God-fearing
It is the Gardens of Eden wherein they enter into the joy of Allah, their Creator, and experience the pleasure afforded by the rivers running directly beneath. Therein they will have whatever object of desire from which pleasure or satisfaction is expected and any wish they express in words or in thought will be instantly fulfilled, for thus does Allah reward those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
It is these whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues at the moment they encounter the angels of death who disembody their souls. They -the angels- greet them with the expressions of good will: "Peace be upon you. Make entry into Paradise which is the reward commensurate with your deeds
Do they -the infidels- purpose to wait until some fitting event presents itself and they distinctly perceive the angels or experience the execution of Allah's decree of retributive punishment! Thus much did their predecessors behave and it was not Allah Who did them injustice but it was they who wronged themselves
By consequence, did the evil line of conduct to which they committed themselves and the evil deeds they conferred on themselves spring back and recoil on them, and they were beset on all sides by the same material and immaterial things they had turned in to ridicule
And to excuse their infidelity which it is not possible to justify, the idolaters insolently say: "Had Allah willed, neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped besides Him other gods, nor would we have enforced taboos other than those decreed by Him" Thus much acted their predecessors. But is the Messenger really responsible for any act or a duty other than relating the divine message and the elucidation of its text
And to every nation did We send a Messenger to say to them: " Worship Allah alone and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites and avoid at any cost worshipping anything else irrespective of his or its attribute, be it a human or an idol." And so, among them -the people- there were those whom Allah had guided to His path of righteousness and others who thrived on disobedience and verified Allah's justifiable ordination to their loss in the maze of error
In fact, if you O Muhammad are anxious for their guidance to Allah's path of righteousness, you had better realize that He does not guide those who thrive on disobedience and come within the measure of His wrath, nor shall they find those who afford them help
And they -the Pagans- make a solemn declaration with an appeal to Allah -if there be any- or to one of their false gods, -and they are many- that Allah shall never resurrect anyone once he is dead. But indeed He shall. This is a divine promise and the promise of Allah is truth personified but most people do not realize this fact
It is an act of mercy to both the guilty and the innocent- that Allah resurrects the dead and restores them to life to illucidate to them the strained points upon which the whole unreasoning turned and the points which were once in the heat of. dispute so that the infidels who denied Him and/or His statutes realize how unjust they were to themselves and to others to justify their falsehood and assert it as true
Indeed, all it takes when We will to bring anything into existence is simply to say to it: "Be" and it is
And those who fled their homes and homeland by reason of persecution and emigrated to where they could best serve Allah's cause shall be the recipients of His mercy and blessings. We will confer on them Our prevenient and efficacious grace here; the efficacious grace promised Hereafter is indeed far greater if only they knew
These are the votaries who possessed their souls in patience purposed to fulfill their obligation to Allah and satisfy their conscience and their hearts, and in Him they put their trust
And never did Allah send Messengers before you O Muhammad but were men and not angels to whom We inspired Our message. Therefore, you -infidels- may ask those who are well versed in the antecedent Scriptures -Jews and Christians- if indeed you do not know
We inspired to them clear and plain revelations and signs as well as AL- Zabur (the Psalm) which guide out of darkness and superstitions elf later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual light into illumination and enlightenment. And We inspired to you O Muhammad the Quran to explain to the people all that has been revealed to them of decrees, ordinances and the fundamental principles of Allah's system of faith and worship so that they may hopefully ponder
And now, do the infidels take their cunning for a sinister and crooked wisdom fraught with mischief and feel secure against Allah's wrath which may speak thunder. It may cause the earth to sink under their feet and assert them as her own, or that they unexpectedly be seized with a calamity from whence they never expected or perceived
Or are they certain in their minds that they shall not be seized with punishment in the midst of their activities, doings or movements and they be able to escape
Or that He shall not punish them by inspiring to them constant sense of danger and cause their gradual fall from power, in His own manner, until it is vanished, -re- conquest of Macca, and many other recent events-, to give them a chance, that at some point they may wake up to their senses. Allah is indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun
Did they -the infidels- not see into Allah's cosmic sign of the shadow, and how everything that He has created casts its shadow -or image- upon a surface by intercepting the direct rays of the great luminary and other luminaries, and how do objects turn their shadows right and left according to the relative position of the source of light, and how such shadows are governed by cosmic laws in comely prostration to Allah incensed by humiliation
And to Allah do all created beings in the heavens and all living creatures on earth prostrate themselves in reverence and adoration and so do the angels who do not display inordinate self-esteem
They entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and keep in awe of Him, their Creator, Who is far above them and beyond all, and they discharge their duties in obedience to His command
And Allah has emphasized His Oneness and Uniqueness. He repeatedly said: "Do not Worship two gods, He is One and only, and therefore, fear Me and keep in awe of Me alone
To Him belong all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth, and religion is a duty and an obligation incumbent on all. Therefore, will you all hold in awe of an Ilah other than Allah, the Creator
Do you -people- not realize that all grace abounding in you is the grace of Allah, and when you are befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity it is to Him that you instinctively cry, pray and beseech for help
Yet when He delivers you from what was burdensome and exhaustive to the mind, some of you incorporate with Him other deities
A way of showing ingratitude and the indisposition to acknowledge the benefits received. But you just keep serving the Devil and lust after your sinful system of faith and worship and before long you shall come to know the consequence of denying the truth
They dedicate to their idols, designating them ignorantly as gods, a part of what We apportioned to them of Our bounty -cattle, crops,-, when neither themselves nor their belongings or possessions are really their own, but Allah's own. By Allah, you -infidels- shall have much to answer for and be heavily punished for your intentional assertion of what is false
And in their corrupted minds, they presume upon Allah; they regard the angels as females (the gender they detest) and ascribe them to Him as His daughters; exalted be He. Yet they ascribe to themselves the males, the gender they approve and favourably accept
The moment any of them hears the news of the birth of his own female child, his countenance at once speaks a different language, His eyes shrivel into darkness in his head and he falls into the darkness of dismay
He hides from people or keeps out of sight to conceal the news, which allegedly defames him and blackens his repute. He does not know whether to keep his child alive and be both defamed and despised or bury her in the dust and consign her and the news to oblivion. Evil indeed is the resolution uniting their evil thoughts
If these infidels who deny the Hereafter were to be likened in a parable to anything material or immaterial to represent their attributes, their image shall always stand similitude exact of evil, whereas if we were to represent Allah in a parable we find Him above all comparison and like unto Him there is none. And if His attributes were represented in a parable they shall be summed up in the word "Perfection" personified. and He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
And if Allah were to punish the people for their wrong or evil doings the minute they commit themselves to such a line of conduct, He would not allow one single living creature domiciled on earth to remain thereon, but He respites them to a predetermined point of time (that they may hopefully repent). And when their time is fulfilled never shall they be able to delay it or anticipate it for one hour or infinitely less
And they ascribe to Allah the female gender which they themselves detest and they give a speaking tongue to falsehood at the grossness of which; common sense revolts. They presume upon Allah that all that is good and pleasing shall fall to their lot. It is no wonder that Hell shall be the sea of misery into which their sail be rushed
Rest assured O Muhammad by Allah, your Creator, We sent Messengers before you to nations who preceded in order of time. 'They presented them with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth. But AL-Shaytan (Satan) allured them to brighter worlds as a logical result or sequence to their doings and he led the way then and he leads it now amid the encircling gloom wherein he leads them by the nose, but they shall suffer painfully for it
And We send down the Book -the Quran- to you O Muhammad only to serve Allah's purpose and be of service in effecting Allah's object of illucidating to the various sects and to the people at large the strained points upon which the whole unreasoning turns and the points in the heat of dispute. 1t is the spirit of truth that guides into all truth as well as a mercy to those whose hearts are imprinted with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
And it is Allah Who sends down rain-water from the floor of the vault of heaven wherewith He revives the earth after it has suffered death. This is indeed emblematic of Almightiness; food for thought that is taken by those who are disposed to listen
And you certainly have a sermon in cattle, serving as an incitement and exhortation to you people. We supply you with a drink from their bellies, a drink produced -under specific circumstances- in the breasts by conjoint action between chyle -the product of chyme or digested food in the intestines- and blood -which carries to the breasts all necessary aliment and elements- and there flows wholesome Milk, pure white and palatable to those who drink it
And out of the date-palm and the vine you extract sweet Juices, and other wholesome beverages; another sign, among the marvels of Allah, esteemed highly by those who reflect
And Allah has inspired the bees with the instinct of building their homes or hives in the mountains, on the trees and in the trellis (constructed for the climbing trees amid their habitations)
And to collect their food from the nectar produced by the blossoms of the various kinds of fruits and to tread the paths to which Allah, their Creator, has guided them -by way of a natural and innate antenna-. There issues from their bellies a nutritious juicy drink of varying hues affording remedy to people. Indeed, this is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace appreciated by people who ponder
And Allah is He Who brought you people into being and caused you to exist. Then He disembodies your souls and deprives you of animate existence, and among you is he who is carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life that he loses the wits once about him and he loses remembrance of the knowledge he formerly mastered and he becomes the abject heir of an illustrious name
And it is Allah Who privileged some of you with more livelihood than others and made His grace abound more in some than in others. And those who are privileged will not go shares with what has fallen to their lot with those whom they have on hand -captives, slaves,- so that they be as the master, so the man. How then do they make Allah go shares with His servants! Is this not simply a denial of His grace which abounds in them
And it is Allah Who provided you with wives and mated you to your kind and from them did He bless you with sons and grandsons, and provisioned you with the wholesome sustenance of victuals, eatables and drinkables. Is it then that they -the infidels- assert or vindicate falsehood and will not esteem Allah's efficacious grace abounding in them
Yet they worship besides Allah objects with no power to provision them from the heavens or from the earth with one part or infinitely less of their sustenance or the necessities of life nor can they possibly do that
And you infidels must realize that Allah is beyond all comparison and like unto Him there is none. Therefore, do not set to Him examples nor express to Him comparisons and parables nor draw similes between Him and created beings, animate or inanimate, for He Knows and you do not
Allah cites an instance of two men in illustration of a general truth. One is a slave, the property of his master, who is divested of freedom and personal rights, the other is the master in whom Our grace abounds; he is free to spend in divine service and/or in other services secretly and publicly. Can they produce or achieve something equal or possess a like degree in any aspect of life! Never. Therefore, how can Allah the Creator of all be equaled with any being! Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes, but most of them do not realize this fact
Again Allah cites an instance of two other men in illustration of a general truth: one of them is mute, unable to accomplish anything, totally dependent on his master for his livelihood. Wherever he sends him to perform a work he utterly fails to accomplish the desired end. Does he compare width his master who is whole just and keeps on the path of righteousness
And it is Allah alone Who is Omniscient of all the hidden, the unknown and the mysteries in the heavens and the earth which are beyond human knowledge or comprehension. The bringing about of the Eventful Event of the predetermined Hour takes no more time than that taken in the twinkle of an eye or even less; Allah is Qadirun indeed over all things
And it is Allah Who brought you of your mothers' wombs to the external world unconscious of your surroundings, devoid of intellectual acquaintance or with perception of your environment and empty of all knowledge, and He provided you with the faculties of hearing and vision faculties divine, and He implanted in you the seat of feeling, understanding and thought –intellect- that you may hopefully be thankful
Do they -the infidels- not apply their sight and direct their intellectual eye to the birds moving through mid air at the floor of the vault of heaven! No one keeps them equipoise but Him Who designed their construction and made it fit to the object in view. Is this not indeed emblematic of Almightiness and Omnipotence to which bow those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
And it is Allah Who made of your homes a place inspiring calm and peace of mind, and of the skins of animals or hides He provided you with portable dwellings -tents- easy to carry in your travels from place to place and to pitch them where you choose to rest. And from their wool, their fur and their hair did He furnish you with movable articles, goods and chattels to enjoy up to a predetermined point of time
And it is Allah Who made the trees and other objects He created cast shadows* when they intercept light to protect you from the scorching heat of the sun and He hollowed out for you caves in the hills and the mountains to shelter you and He equipped you with garments to protect you from the heat and other garments -armours- to shield you from the weapons when you contend in warfare. Thus does Allah mean to make all grace abound in you that you may hopefully conform to Islam
Should they yet O Muhammad turn a deaf ear, you incur no blame, for you are responsible only for relating the divine message and the illucidation of its text
These infidels are fully aware of Allah's grace abounding in them, but their wrongful actions and their unpious and unwise deeds bespeak clearly of the denial of Allah's merited or unmerited favours. And those of them who do not acknowledge Allah's goodwill constitute the majority
The day shall come when We summon a witness from every nation -the Messenger sent to them- to testify of his peoples' response. There and then never shall those who denied Allah be permitted to plea in justification of their deeds of inequity. And if they invoke His forgiveness, never will heaven respond favourably to their invocation
And on the Day the wrongful of actions are confronted with the torment laid on the damned, never shall it be mitigated nor be put in respite
And when those who incorporated with Allah other deities see their predominant partners, they shall say: "These, O Allah, are our partners whom we invoked besides You". But the predominant partners shall cast back the charge and say to them: "You are indeed liars
There and then shall they -the infidels- resign themselves to the will of Allah and be forsaken and renounced by those whom they presumed to share with Allah His divine nature
Those who denied Allah and stood in the way to prevent His spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth shall have much to answer for. We will double their punishment. They shall be requited for the denial of Allah and for obstructing divine truth and creating discord
The day shall come when We summon a witness from every nation, the Messenger who evolved from their midst and conveyed Our message, to testify of his peoples' response and We summon you O Muhammad to testify of your peoples' response. The Book -the Quran- which We sent down to you is the fountain-head of divine knowledge and the chief source of divine information. It illucidates every aspect of every thought and it is a guide into all truth and a mercy extended to the people and a joyful tidings to those who conformed to Islam
Allah enjoins justice and deeds of wisdom and piety, and benevolence to those of your kindred who are in need. And He forbids all that is wrongful and obscene, all that is offensive and excites disgust and unwarranted severe course of action. He exhorts you and urges you to what is good and laudable, that you may hopefully heed
And fulfill the solemn promise if you make one and keep the vow and do not break the. oaths after being ratified and after you have made solemn appeal to Allah in witness thereof; Allah knows all that you do
Do not be like the unstable workwoman who unravels and breaks the strands of her woven fabric after she has manufactured it in a loom by crossing the warp and the weft and interlaced them very strongly. What a tangled web you weave when first you practice to deceive. You use your oaths among yourselves with the guilt of deception residing in the intention; you break and dishonour your vows with the weak when you find them more advantageous with the strong. This is unexcusable nor is it in conformity with Islamic principles. Allah tests your prudence and in Day of Judgment shall He clear up matters with which you were at variance
Had Allah willed He would have made all of you one conjoint body united in feeling and thought, but He deafens the heart's ears of whom He pleases and opens the mind's eyes of whom He will
And do not carelessly use your oaths among yourselves to practise deception lest one's foot should slide and lose its hold after it has been holding in a stable position and you suffer the evil consequence for precluding Allah's spirit of truth from guiding into all truth and you suffer the torment laid upon the damned
Nor dishonour My covenant or exchange it for the vanity of the fleeting and ephemeral world. What Allah has in store for those who honour their vows is indeed in superlatives if only you knew
What you people may have of advantages shall come to an end or cease to exist whereas what Allah has is eternal and everlasting, and We will richly reward those who possessed their souls in patience which was purposed to fulfill their obligation to Allah and satisfy their conscience and their hearts. Their reward shall be assessed at the gauge of the best of their deeds
Anyone whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety, be it male or female, and whose heart with the image of religious and spiritual virtues shall be made to enjoy a good and happy life that is worth living and We will reward them Hereafter at the gauge of the best of their worldly deeds
And when you recite the Quran begin with the opening formula of seeking Allah's help against satanic secret suggestions to the mind, thus: "To You O Allah do I commit myself counter to AL-Shaytan the accursed
He has no influence on those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand and in Allah they trust
But he exerts influence upon those who take him as a tutelary guardian and incorporate with Allah other deities
If We happen to exchange a revelation which has already served its purpose for another revelation appropriate for the new circumstance, and Allah knows exactly what to reveal and when, they -the infidels- accuse your O Muhammad of forgery. Indeed, most of them do not know the facts nor do they reflect
Say to them: "This and that and all divine revelations are being conveyed by the Holy Spirit from Allah, my Creator, to strengthen -in opinion, action and purpose- those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand and they are joyful tidings to those who have conformed to Islam
And We do know what they say, thus: "He -Muhammad- is being taught by a man who dictates to him the words he expresses to the people". But the man they refer to is foreign while the Quran is being revealed in plain Arabic literary form
Indeed, those who deny Allah's revelations shall not be blessed with Allah's guidance to His path of righteousness and must expect the torment which shall be laid upon the damned
Those who intentionally assert falsehood are but those who deny Allah's revelations and it is they who lie in their teeth
He who renounces his faith in Allah after he has conformed his will earlier to His will shall suffer for it unless he has been forced to do so by persecution and assault but deep down he preserves a heart happily maintaining the image of religious and spiritual virtues. But he who cunningly and deceptively incites someone to reject the idea of Faith and allures him or her to brighter worlds shall have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and these are they who shall pass through nature to eternal suffering
This is on account of their love for life here afore that Hereafter, besides the fact that Allah does not guide those who deny Him to His path of righteousness
These are they whose hearts has Allah imprinted with dullness of Comprehension and whose faculties of hearing and sight with lack of perception and these are the heedless
It is no wonder that Hereafter shall they be the captive victors who have lost in gain
Nevertheless, Allah, your Creator, accepts true repentance and the atonement made by the people. Therefore, those who emigrated to where they could best serve Allah, after they had suffered persecution and were forced to turn renegade, and strove in Allah's cause. and endured the hardships with patience and perseverance shall find Allah indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun
The Day shall come when each soul pleads on behalf of itself and is requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and never shall they be wronged
Allah represents the fate of those who rebelled against His law by means of a parable of the town in which His grace abounded in security and peace of mind and in rich supplies of provisions from every direction. But instead of content living ever in thankful hearts, its heart beat rebellious to its own resolves and was rendered ungrateful to Allah and disobedient to His laws. By consequence He incensed it by humiliation and vested it with hunger and fear devolving upon it in requital of what its peoples' souls had impelled them to do
A Messenger who evolved in their midst was sent to them with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth, but they denied Our message and accused him of falsehood. In consequence, they came within the measure of Our wrath and were made to suffer for their perpetual iniquities
These were people who refused to acknowledge the true source of the bounty. Therefore, eat O you Muslims of what We provisioned you; it is all replete with choice of all delight and enjoy all that is pure lawful, wholesome and not forbidden, and be thankful to Allah for His grace
He only forbids you to eat the flesh of a dead beast and blood, the flesh of swine and the flesh of a beast slaughtered under the invocation of a- name other than that of Allah. But under compelling circumstances and not through willful disobedience and transgression shall Allah admit of relaxation that no sin is incurred; Allah is indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun
Do not give a speaking tongue to falsehood at the grossness of which common sense revolts. You create taboos for yourselves out of superstition and designate this as lawful and that as forbidden, wherefore you assert what is false and ascribe it to Allah. Those who relate falsehood to Allah or wittingly endeavour by falsification of words to make things seem divine which are not, shall never be graced with prosperity from heaven, nor with success
They derive pleasure and satisfaction from their falsehood but the pleasure it affords them is of short duration, then comes the encounter with the torment laid upon the damned
As to the Jews, We forbade them -for their iniquities- the things We have already mentioned to you O Muhammad earlier* We never wronged them but it was they who always wronged themselves
Nevertheless, Allah, your Creator, always extends mercy and forgiveness to those who wrong themselves in ignorance and repent thereafter imprinting their deed with wisdom and piety; Allah, your Creator, is indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun
Ibrahim (Abraham) was indeed a perfect example of excellence, submissive to the will of Allah and an Orthodox Muslim. He never incorporated with Allah other deities
He was always thankful for the grace of Allah abounding in him; Allah chose him and guided him to His path of righteousness
And We bestowed upon him Our prevenient and efficacious grace here and he shall be a crown to the virtuous Hereafter
And We inspired to you O Muhammad what We ordained: that you follow the system of faith and worship followed by Ibrahim, the orthodox Muslim who never incorporated with Allah other deities
The Sabbath was imposed on those who were hard hearted and always disputed with their prophet and argued against its validity and its timing -the Jews- Saturday and the Christians -Sunday- and many among them defiantly and shamefully broke it. And they shall always contend with opposing arguments until Allah settles their dispute in Day of Judgement
Invite people O Muhammad graciously to the path of Allah, the path of righteousness, with wise, graceful and appropriate inducements meeting them on their own ground and propitiating them, each in his own capacity, to open their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes. Reason with them in a logical, peaceable and gracious manner; Allah, your Creator, knows best those who have wandered from His path of righteousness and He knows best those who steer a straight course and Providence their guide
And if you should inflict punishment, exact a retribution or make reprisals for injury, harm or wrong, then you may avenge your right with a similar injury and to the same extent. But if you bear the wrong and bear with the wrongful -as an obligation to Allah and not a reflection of human weakness- you shall possess your souls, derive great benefits and advantage yourselves of Allah's expectative grace
And have patience O Muhammad, show forbearance under their provocation and bear with them their faults and limitations. For in patience, you apply yourself unto Allah Who consoles your soul and your heart unto wisdom which alleviates your mental distress. And do not be grieved at heart for their denial of the divine message and for their hearts which dare rise defiant against Allah. Nor should you be sorely distressed on account of their cunning which they take for a sinister and crooked wisdom
Rest assured that Allah upholds those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence
Glory be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes attendant upon His manifestation of conducting His servant by night from the Sacrosanct Mosques - Macca- to the Farthest Mosque,- Jerusalem whose precincts We had blessed. A journey that was planned without the factor of time or that of space to show him our spiritual world and some of Our signs evincing both Our Almightiness and Omnipresence. Allah is indeed AL-Sami' (Omnipresent) with unlimited audition and AL-Bassir (He clearly sees all things)
It was within these precincts which constituted the heart of the Sacred environs that Bani Isra‘il (the Children of Israel) were directed to make their abode and We sent to them Mussa to whom We gave the Book,-AL-Tawrah (Torah)- which was a guide into all truth, and We enjoined them thus: "Take no tutelary guardian", We said, "other than Me
They were the progeny of those whom We carried in the Ark with Nuh (Noah) who was a thankful worshipper in whose heart reigned piety and gratitude
We foretold Bani Israel in the Book, thus: "You shall occasion two events of self-induced misfortunes; twice shall your arrogance stir you up to exaltation and be your greatest incitement of evil to the end that you shall go to the mischief and create discord
When in due time the first occasion came to pass We humbled your arrogance by wedding you to a calamity. We sent against you servants of Ours invested with merciless power and martial daring who penetrated deep in the land and made their way right through your homes, and there the mission was accomplished and the promise fulfilled
When the conquerors abounded in self - conceit and you humbled yourselves to Allah We gave you mastery over them and We made you abound more in numerosity
There, you can see that if you imprint your deeds with wisdom and piety and conduct yourselves with prudence, you advantage yourselves of good behavior. But if you should bode ill, misbehave or commit yourselves to an evil line of conduct you will have harmed your own souls. Then, when in due time the second occasion* came to pass you were overpowered and vanquished that your countenances spoke a different language. Your eyes shriveled into darkness in your heads and you fell into the darkness of dismay and they -the enemies- broke into you Temple as they did once before and reduced to ruins all that they acquired
May Allah, your Creator have mercy on you; but should you resume your iniquities, We will in turn resume Our retributive punishment. We have made Hell for the infidels the dungeon's grim confines
This Quran does indeed guide to the best way of moral rightness which has had everlasting residence in the character of the Godhead and to the uprightness of decision. It announces joyful tidings to those who acknowledge Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds of wisdom and piety; they shall be recipients of a great reward
As it announces an ominous destiny to those who deny the Day of Judgement that they must expect the torment laid upon the damned
Man moves quickly and sometimes unjustly (as in response to slander) to invoke evil upon people as he moves quickly to invoke a blessing upon them, for man has a natural propensity in him to be unduly hasty of spirit
We made the night and the day two outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace. We effaced the light from the entity of the night and put it out in obscure darkness to hide things from view. We made the day a visible entity for objects to be perceptible by the sense of sight in order to betake yourselves to Providence, for His bounty, and in order to know the number of the years. Also to reckon the time occupied by the sun in its apparent passage through the signs of the Zodiac and the period of the earth's revolution round the sun forming a natural unit of time and you be able to compute time and determine it by calculation. And everything did We expound and make plain and abounding in detail
We encircled the neck of every human being with a bird of omen, (as it were) auguring well or ill, and in Day of Judgement will We present each with a book bearing his precise record laid open to view
There and then shall each be told, thus: "Read your own book and enough is your secret self be today your judge
Indeed, he who is steered by the spirit of truth into all truth and Providence his guide benefits his own soul, and he who errs and strays from the path of truth and righteousness will prejudice his own soul. No soul bearing wrongs or not, will in any way bear the wrong of another, nor would We inflict a penalty on a people until We had sent to them a Messenger serving as a spectacle and a warning and they counselled deaf
And when We justly decide to do away with a town by reason of obliquity, We incite those of its people who live in luxury to indulge in the style of shameless luxury, and there comes to be what was predicted beforehand that they were born to be losers and We reduce it to a useless form
How many generations have We uprooted since the period in the life of Nuh, and enough is Allah, your Creator, to hold prescience and be an eyewitness of the iniquities of His servants
He who wishes to go by the world and its fleeting, evanescent and ephemeral enjoyment and glory will find Allah moving quickly to respond to whom He will and apportion to him what He will, but in the end We will make Hell his abode where he sits brooding on its vast abyss, censured, despised and rejected
But he who chooses the Hereafter and has purposed that it be the heart of his purpose and directs his efforts to fulfilling the requirements incidental to this end with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues shall, he and such persons find that heir endeavor is esteemed and highly appreciated
Those and these are given what is apportioned to them. We bestow on both of them of our bounty and never was the bounty of Allah, your Creator, confinable to any limits
See how We distinguish some in status, rank or fortune above others! And by the same token have We made the Hereafter excel here below and be the world of choice
Do not set up with Allah another god nor incorporate with Him other deities lest you should be censured and left abandoned and forsaken
Allah, your Creator, has ordained, that you worship no one but Him and you adore Him with appropriate acts and rites and that you commit your parents to your kind care. When one or both of them attain old age they expect your friendly disposition by your conduct to them. Therefore do not offend them by giving vent to an exclamation of impatience or disgust nor should you rebuke or reprimand them and let your dissertation with them be a sweet discourse
And lower to them the wing of power in humility, standing manifest of kindness and mercy and invoke Allah to be merciful to them and express your invocatory prayer in words, thus: O Allah, my Creator, I pray and beseech you to extend to them Your mercy in return for bringing me up and setting me on my feet which confess their toilsome care for me in my childhood
Allah, my Creator, knows best your thoughts and feelings and all that is stored in your innermost being. If you happen to be virtuous, He is indeed forgiving to those who in lowliest plight repentant stand
And render to the poor being of kin his due and also to the needy and to the wayfarer who does not have the means for transportation, but do not expend extravagantly or wastefully
Indeed, the wasteful given to useless or excessive expenditure are the twins of the satanic, and AL-Shaytan has been rebellious, disobedient and ungrateful to Allah, his Creator
But if you happen to keep away from those of them who are needy in expectation of Allah's mercy to help you be helpful to them, then let your dissertation with them, until then, be a sweet discourse
And do not bind your hand to your neck, as it were, unwilling to give or spend anything, nor should you spread it in the "spread-eagle style", lest you sit brooding on the vast abyss of reprimand and woeful want
Indeed, Allah, your Creator, gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously to whom He will and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will. He has always been Khabirun (Omniscient) and Bassirun, (Omnipresent) whose constant vigilance is extended to all His creatures
Do not kill your children for fear of want. We provide for them and for you. Indeed, killing them was a flagrant violation of Allah's system of faith and worship and a major sin
Nor should you commit adultery. It is a forbidden sexual union, regarded by Allah as an immoral act, a degrading vice and an evil line of conduct
Nor should you deprive anyone of life Allah has made sacred, unless be justified for a proved crime. And if someone has been killed wrongfully, then his next of kin is authorized by Allah to use the means of procuring redress of grievances through avenging his right or forgiveness, (court of law, now). But should he choose to avenge his right, he must not carry it to excess, for the divine law is on his side
Nor should you encroach upon the property of the orphan, unless it be with the motive principle of improving, advancing or raising it to be a better quality or condition, until he reaches maturity and be able to take charge of it. Fulfill the solemn promise if you should make one and keep the vow and meet your engagements and obligations. A vow is great responsibility and those who break it shall have much to answer for in Day of Judgement
Dispense the quantity ascertained by measuring to the full if you happen to sell by a standard measure. And if you are using the method of weighing then you are enjoined to use an accurate and precise balance conforming to a standard, and an exemplar of truth and equity. This is a wise course of action ensuring safety and leading to the intended purpose
And do not gratify your desire or inclination to pursue a subject of which you have no knowledge nor charge anyone with a fault or a crime when you are not sure of his guilt nor pursue vain things which will avail you nothing. Indeed, he faculties of hearing, sight and intellect, each and all, are held responsible in Day of Judgement and shall have much to answer for
Nor should you walk on earth displaying inordinate self-esteem or with an overweening opinion of your qualities, attainments or estate, for even if the incessant tread of your feet wear the rough stones smooth, you shall not be able to rend the earth nor shall you be able to level to a mountain in height
Of all such attributes, those that have a name of evil savour stand in Allah's sight accursed and deserving of hatred
These -the above mentioned attributes- are maxims expressing some of the manifestation of wisdom Allah, your Creator, has inspired to you. He has issued a mandate commanding that you people do not associate with Him another Ilah nor incorporate with Him other deities lest you should be thrown into Hell where you sit brooding on the vast abyss of reprimand and rejection
Do you -infidels- really believe that Allah, your Creator, has committed to you the sons and ascribed to Himself the daughters from among the angels! In effect what you put in words to describe your thoughts of Him is indeed malicious, slanderous, blasphemous and of grave consequence
We have expounded and oriented Our revelations in this Quran to circumstances and requirements so as to bring them -the infidels- to their senses, yet they do what is contrary to that normally expected. They push themselves away from it with an averted state of mind and feelings and with a mental attitude of opposition and repugnance
Say to them: If indeed He had, as they say, associate deities who share His divine nature, His Omnipotence and His Authority, then they would have certainly sought out a way to expropriate Him of His throne, His rights and His Exclusive Authority
Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes, He is infinitely far above the impiety they utter against Him
The seven heavens and the earth and all animate and inanimate beings therein praise His glory and extoll His glorious attributes. There is not one single creature but displays outward and visible signs of an inward and spiritual grace reflecting Allah's Omnipotence and Exclusive Authority, but you -infidels- do not apprehend their way of ascribing His glory. Indeed, He has always been Halimun (Forbearing) and Ghafurun (Forgiving)
When you Muhammad recite the Quran We interpose an invisible screen between you and those who deny the Hereafter to keep their better nature isolated from the truth
We enshrouded their hearts to preclude them from exercising intellectual power or understanding and struck them deaf so that nothing that engages the intellect would come to their hearing. These are the people whose hearts dare rise defiant against Allah; when you recite the Quran and Allah is mentioned as the sole Omnipotent and Exclusive Authority, they insolently turn their backs upon you with a mental attitude of opposition and repugnance
We do know the reason why they lend you their ears when they listen to you O Muhammad; they are reticent about their intention disclosed only in their secret counsel. They turn what they hear to ridicule albeit their nature or innermost being is attracted to the divine discourse. To keep their nobility and authority in the status quo, the wrongful of actions publicly declare, thus: "You people" they say, "only follow a man who has witchcraft in his lips and you foolishly hang on to them
See how they describe you O Muhammad in irrelevant similies reflecting deviation of mind and thought that they are unable to strike on the path of truth that guides into all truth
They say in wonderment: " Do you mean that after we have been reduced to bones and dust we shall be restored to life and be created anew
Say to them: "So be it, even if you were converted into stones or iron
Or any other material you have in mind and you know it is beyond animation" There and then they shall say: "who will then restore us to life?" Say to them: "He who brought you into being and caused you to exist in the first creation". There, they shall shake their heads to you in doubt and ask: "When". Say to them: "It may well be quite soon
This shall be the Day when He summons you all from the graves and you rise praising the O Allah and ascribing His glory
Tell My servants O Muhammad who declare or state in words a specified fact, thought, opinion or intention, an event or a remark or the like to say what is friendly, favourable and laudatory and to keep a civil tongue in their heads, for AL-Shaytan is on the alert for an occasion to divide mankind and set them at variance and to stir up enmity among them. Indeed AL-Shaytan has always been to man an avowed enemy
Allah, your Creator, knows best your disposition. He has mercy on you if He will or if He will He inflicts you with punishment, and We did not send you to the people to be their tutelary guardian
Allah, your Creator, knows best all creatures, the animate and the inanimate in the heavens and on earth and We invested some prophets with more privileges than we invested others and We gave David the Psalms
Say to the infidels who incorporate with Allah other deities "Ask earnestly or humbly or make a devout supplication to those objects of worship whom you suppose share with Allah His divine nature and you shall realize that they shall utterly fail to respond. They have neither the power to relieve you from what is burdensome and exhaustive to the mind nor the influence to avert it either
Those to whom they make a devout supplication -Saints, jinn or angels- are themselves devout servants of Allah seeking the union of their nature with the Divine, and striving which of them shall be the nearest to Allah and the more efficient in serving His purpose! They entertain expectation of His mercy and they dread His retributive punishment. Indeed, the punishment Allah, your Creator, inflicts on the offender makes one heedful, for the thought of it arouses an emotional feeling tinged with latent and deep mysterious fear
There is not one single town but shall suffer destruction before The Day of Judgement or We make them suffer the torment We lay upon the damned, an ordinance that has been decreed and entered in the archetypal Book
In fact nothing prevented Us from sending you O Muhammad to the people with the power of working miracles to evince both your mission and Allah's Omnipotence and Rightful Authority except that people of bygone times refused to acknowledge them. Among them were the Thamudites to whom We sent the she –camel- as an evident and undoubted sign, but they mistreated her without due regard and wronged themselves. We only authorize the work of miracles so that the people be moved with a mingled feeling of dread and reverence toward Allah and realize the evil consequence of disobeying or denying Him
And for once We told you O Muhammad that Allah, your Creator, surrounds all people on all sides -therefore declare Allah's message and do not be afraid ever-. We only made you see the vision of glory We presented to you in your night journey through the spiritual world to test the inclination of the people and their spiritual and moral attributes. The same purpose was also served by the accursed tree growing in the bottom of Hell to feed the sinners. We purposed that the infidels be moved with a mingled feeling of dread and veneration toward Allah and realize the evil consequence of disobeying and denying Him. But on the contrary, it only makes them sink deeper under the vexations of their minds, run riot and transgress the goal
We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam in adoration", and they prostrated to him in comely order, praise and admiration except Iblis AL- Shaytan-to-be who said: "Shall I prostrate myself before him whom You created from clay
And he added: "Do you see that creature whom you treated with more honour than you treated me!" "If You grant me respite from death till The Day of Judgement, I will bridle his progeny, control them and misguide them excepting a few
Reprieve is granted", said Allah, "wherefore you and those of them who follow you shall suffer the fatal consequence. Hell shall be requital enough of the manner you conducted yourselves in life
Entice those of them whom you can allure to brighter worlds with your whispering voice and assault them by any manner of means, be it cavalry or infantry or any other means, and go shares with them in their ill-gotten gains and in their illegitimate children, and give them fair words and large promises to fair the foul and to arouse in them vain desires. In effect what AL-Shaytan promises them is only what is vain, deceptive and deluding
Indeed, My devout servants" Allah added, "do not come under your authority nor have you the power to influence their conduct or actions and enough is Allah, your Creator, to be their Tutelary Guardian
It is Allah, your Creator, Who keeps the ships afloat and makes them move on the surface of the sea to be of service in effecting your objects which are sought after of His Bounty. Indeed, He has been always Rahimun (Merciful) to you
And when you are befallen with a misfortune or with a distressful condition at sea, there vanish into thin air those whom you invoke besides Him. And when He delivers you safe ashore you turn away from Him! It is a pity that man has always been inclined to display no gratitude
Do you -infidels- feel really secure and in your minds you are sure that He who is in heaven's realm will not cause that shore bordering on the sea where you disembark to sink down below your feet and you disappear utterly in its depth! Or that He will not make you suffer the disastrous consequences of a whirlwind and a sand dune and no one will you find then to afford you protection or to render void Our decree
Or do you feel really secure and in your minds you are sure that He will not send you back to sea on another occasion and send against you a gale of considerable strength that drowns you in requital of your ingratitude and no avenger will you find to exact satisfaction or retaliate upon Us on your behalf
We have honoured the Adamites and We provided them with means of transportation to carry them on land and at sea and We provisioned them with the good wholesome victuals and We placed them in a class distinctly above many of Our creatures and We ascribed to them distinguished attributes. We furnished them with powers of the mind -the will, the reason and the perception of truth or fact, theoretical and practical understanding of art, science, language- and many other faculties
And the Day shall come when We summon all people, each nation with their respective leader who is to bear witness to the behavior of his people and the way they conducted themselves in life. There and then he who is given his book of his record in life in his right hand shall he and such persons be delighted to read their records and no one shall ever be wronged not even to the equivalent of a single hair of the dry integument of the smallest seed
And he who has been blind here below and has been lacking in intellectual, moral and spiritual perception shall be jus as blind Hereafter, having no opening for light as if he were lost in blind mazes of entangled wood
They -the infidels- tried their best to tempt you O Muhammad and incite you to make some concessions. They thought they almost seduced you into a course of action totally undivine
Had We not confirmed you and influenced your heart and mind and impelled to the feeling of authority and security of position you would have gone along with them up to a point, thinking that with making a small concession you would succeed in fulfilling the divine mission
But then, by consequence, We would have made you taste a double punishment in life and at death, besides the second death, and no protector would be found to render void Our decree
They were resolved to impel you to the feeling of fear to make you resolve to quit the land and depart from Macca. But then they would have been allowed to remain only for a short while to come to the end of their rope wherefore We vanquish them and reduce them into a useless form
This has always been Allah's way of action which has long been pursued in the past with those of the Messengers whom We had sent before you in order of time. Each typical instance formed a particular case of a principle and a single instance of punishment. This mode of action, you will find, shall never alter
You just engage in the act of worship and hold intimate mental and spiritual intercourse with Allah at the point of time of the sun's declination or deviation from the Meridian or the zenith of the sky as it begins to sink toward setting and onward to the time when the darkness of the night prevails* And noteworthy is the Quran when recited at dawn. Indeed recital of the Quran at dawn is of great moment and a goodly loan. It inspires piety to the heart and makes the soul sensible of the presence of Allah; it is attended by the angels who witness its perusal
And rouse up during the hours of the night to additional devotional exercise which is meritorious and adds to your credit; may Allah, your Creator, elevate you to a position of great honour, excellence and glory
And call upon Allah in your invocatory prayer thus: "O Allah, my Creator, may I ask You to make my entry upon the stage of life an entry by the gate of truth wherefore I stay my course in accordance with the divine standard. And make O Allah, my Creator, my exit at the end of my doings and from the scene of life an egress vested with fidelity, truthfulness, virtue and integrity, and invest me, my Creator, with the divine insignia of power and authority
And say: "Truth has now prevailed and falsehood has eventually perished, for falsehood is always apt to perish in the wreck of time
And We have send down, from the realm of heaven, of the Quran what serves as a remedy and a mercy to those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues whereas it adds to the detriment of the wrongful of actions
When We mercifully bring man in Our grace and show it in Our munificence, he feels impelled to move away and more distant from what Allah inclines him to propound, and when he is befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity he nurses despair
Say to them: "Every one acts according to his inherent and innate disposition or character, and Allah, your Creator, knows quite well who exercises his will to the best to accept Allah's Authority, espouse His cause and keep in His path
And they ask you O Muhammad about the spirit
If We willed, We could erase from your mind or memory O Muhammad all that We have inspired to you of divine discourse, and you shall find no one to plead on your behalf or render void Our decree
But it is only through the mercy of Allah, your Creator, that it continues to be preserved. Indeed, great is His bounty and much is His grace that abound in you
Say to them "It could not be more emphasized that if both mankind and the Jinn should come together to compose a divine discourse of a like nature to the Quran, never shall they be able to produce a discourse of its likeness even with the help of one party to the other
We have expounded and oriented Our revelations in the Quran to circumstances and requirements and We quoted every typical instance forming a particular case of a principle, yet most people simply refuse to acknowledge the truth and will not express esteem nor gratitude
They say to you O Muhammad: "We will not believe in you until you have caused water to rise and flow in a constant stream out of the ground
Or until you have an orchard enclosing palm-trees and vines and you cause the earth to cleave in its midst forming channels for water to flow in copious streams like rolling rivers with murmuring flows that flow forever
Or until you have caused the sky to fall on our heads in pieces as you assumed it would, or until you have brought before our eyes Allah and His angels together
Or until we have seen you residing in a house adorned with gold, or until we have seen you climbing a ladder heavenward, nor will we believe in your ascent until you have brought down a book that we could read". Say to them: "Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes; am I in any respect but a human Messenger
In effect nothing holds back the people and hinder them from conforming to Islam as ordained by Allah despite sending Messengers to guide them but their presumption upon Providence. "Is it conceivable", they say, "That Allah sends to the people a human Messenger
Say to them: "If it were possible for angels to feel safe and secure when they move about on the ground here below, We would have sent down a divine Messenger
Say to them: "Enough is Allah to be my witness and your witness; He is indeed Khabirun (Omniscient) and Bassirun (Omnipresent) Whose constant vigilance is extended to all His creatures
He whom Allah guides to His path of righteousness is the one who is guided by the spirit of truth into all truth. But those whom Allah sends astray, never shall you find for them tutelary guardians besides Him. We shall throng them drawn on their faces In Day of Judgement, blind, deaf and dumb to be delivered to their appropriate quarters in Hell which is constantly fed with fuel .As often as it abates We feed it so that they suffer the increasingly fierce and merciless flames of the fire
This is in requital of their denial of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and of their refusal to acknowledge His revelations and signs evincing both His Godhead and His divine nature. And they insolently voice their denial of Resurrection. Thus: "Is it conceivable", they exclaim: "that when We have been reduced to bones and dust We will be restored to life and be created anew
Do they not perceive by visual tokens and by their minds' eyes that Allah Who created the heavens and the earth is Omnipotent enough to recreate the like thereof and restore the dead to life and create them anew! It is He Who determined their span of life which He decreed to end at a certain and undoubted point of time, yet the infidels refuse to acknowledge the truth and choose to sink under the vexations of their minds
Say to them: "If you -infidels- were to have a place in the realm of the ruling power and you have the power of governing and controlling the vast treasuries of Allah's mercy, you would have exercised restraint by virtue of your niggardly disposition and for fear of want. Nonetheless, man has always been characterized by parsimony
We went Mussa with nine divine signs. You Muhammad just ask Bani Israel about the course of events relative to Mussa as he presented himself to Pharaoh and his people. Pharaoh said to him: "I do think that you Mussa are indeed bewitched
But you know", said Mussa, "That no one could have sent down these divine and evident signs but the Omnipotent Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth; He made them clear to the understanding and judgement" "In effect I think that you Pharaoh are obstinate and unyielding to the truth and with unerring doom you shall see what is to come
Pharaoh decided on what he thought would be the best course of action, namely, to rid the land of them, but We drowned him together with all those who followed him
Following Pharaoh's death, We said to Bani Isra‘il: "Now you may have your abode in the promised land, and when the promised Day of Judgement comes to pass We will gather you and all the others from wherever you may be
In truth We sent down the Quran and in conformity with fact and in agreement with reality has it been revealed. We have only sent you O Muhammad as a spectacle and a warning
A Quran that has been revealed in partible division at intervals so that you may recite it O Muhammad to the people slowly and deliberately. We revealed it in succeeding stages and each part with the others makes up the whole
Therefore say to them -the infidels- O Muhammad: "Believe in it or do not give credence to it; those to whom We imparted knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light before it was revealed bow to it in reverence and submission. When it is recited to them they cast themselves down prostrate in humility and veneration
And they say: "Praise be to Allah, our Creator, and extolled are His glorious attributes. Indeed, the promise of Allah, our Creator, inevitably comes to pass and is always fulfilled
The Quran influences their senses and minds and excites their emotion that it prompts weeping and as they stand in awe of their Creator they prostrate themselves in profound reverence and humility
Say to the Pagans who reject the attribute AL- Rahman and think it is another god: Invoke Allah or invoke AL-Rahman whichever you choose, for to Him belong all the graceful Names which are the supreme appellations in which His unique qualities are ascribed. And to avoid -O Muhammad- their mockery and derision when you engage in the act of worship, you just entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah. And do not voice your prayer loudly nor pronounce it inaudibly or below your breath but hold a middle degree between the two extremes
And express you gratitude to Him in words for His unipersonality and Unique divine nature, thus: "Praise be to Allah Who did not beget nor adopt a son nor is there anyone to share His divine nature or His realm nor is He dependent upon a tutelary guardian to protect Him from harm and from humiliation and praise Him highly for His imposing Omnipotence
Praise be to Allah Who sent down to His servant the Book -the Quran- well founded, constant ,resolute and did not allow therein of declension, obliquity or crookedness
But orthodox, in accordance with what is divinely and authoritatively established as the truth guiding into all truth so that it strongly warns the ungodly and the impious of the torment laid upon the damned. It announces joyful tidings to those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety to expect a distinguished reward
The reward which merits the blissful abode in the beautitude of heaven wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity
And to give a cautionary notice against the ascription to Allah of plurality and to warn those whose hearts work iniquity not to utter grievous error against Him and irreverently say that He has begotten a son
Neither they nor did their fathers have the true knowledge that is consistent with fact and reality nor do they have the knowledge implying firm belief of what is true on sufficient ground. How enormous, monstrous and atrocious is the word they project and to which they give a speaking tongue! Indeed, what they utter is nothing but falsehood, the product of morbid and deluded minds
Seemingly, you Muhammad are betaking yourself in pursuit of their train of thought with distress, constant regret and discontent and torturing yourself lest they should refuse credit to this divine discourse
We have caused the material world on earth to be of the nature of an embellishment and ornamentation in order to test the peoples' reaction to the grace of Allah and distinguish those of them who will imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety
One day We will render the face of the earth dry and barren - terra firma- destitute of vegetation
Have you meditated O Muhammad upon the event of the inmates of the Cave and upon Allah's intervention exhibiting His control over the laws of nature and serving as evidence of His Almightiness and Omnipotence, It stood as a wonderous sign as all Our signs do stand imposing upon peoples' thoughts
A group of young (Christian) men resolved to escape persecution*; they betook themselves to the Cave -in a mountain near by- where they expressed their invocatory prayer: "O Allah, our Creator". they prayed, "extend to us of Your mercy what will help us endure our tribulation, and direct us to a course of action determining what You commend for us of future events
We, in response, struck them deaf and induced them to sleep for a number of years
Then We roused them and provoked them to activity so that We see which of the two arguing parties would come closer to the exact length of time they remained dormant as a marvel of Allah correlative with Resurrection
We will relate to you O Muhammad in truth the facts, the circumstances and the incidents of their true story. They were a group of young Christian men who conformed their will to Allah's will and We strengthened their purpose by impressing their hearts with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
We confirmed their purpose and made them have the heart and We roused their spirits that they stood firm and declared themselves and revealed their true belief; they said: "Our Allah is the Ilah and Creator of the Heavens and the earth. Never will We invoke besides Him another god for then We will have uttered grievous error against Him
These are our people", they said, "who have pitifully taken other gods besides Him. If only they would present a divine and authoritative evidence in support of their assumption! In effect they presumed upon Providence and who is more wrongful of actions than he who intentionally asserts what is false and relates it to Allah
If you should remove yourselves, said one of them, from their society and do not participate in their system of faith and worship but not from the divine system, then go to the Cave where Allah, your Creator, will extend to you of His mercy what abounds in you and help you endure your tribulation and overcome your difficulties
You could see the sun O Muhammad as it rose turning aside from their Cave to the right and as it set swerving to the left while they occupied a space within in a state of dead sleep; a divine wonderous sign indeed. He whom Allah guides to His path and Providence his guide is indeed guided into all truth, whereas he whom Allah sends astray, never shall you find for him a tutelary guide
You would have thought they were awake -probably their eyes were open- though they were fast asleep. And We turned them over from one side to the other right and left while on the threshold lay their dog with his forelegs outstretched. If you had seen them you would have run away from them making your escape, filled with horror
So conditioned, We aroused them and stirred them into activity only to question each other as to the length of time they had laid themselves to rest. "How long do you think you have been in this place to repose your wearied virtues?" asked one of them. "Probably a day or less", they said. "Allah, your Creator, knows best how long. Meantime send one of you with this silver coin to town in quest of the best food and he brings back some of it to satisfy our hunger, but he must be gentle and courteous and not to attract attention or fix directly upon himself nor indirectly upon you the notice of others
For, should they discover your identity", he continued, "they will over power you, pelt you with stones or else turn you renegades and your purpose shall be defeated here and Hereafter
To serve Our purpose We ordained that their identity be revealed so that they, as well as others, would realize that the promise of Allah is truth personified and that the Day of Judgement is a certainty. The aftermath of the event resolved itself in the manner that was inevitably expected. The people who by then had conformed to Allah's will –Christians- debated the number and the event and its significance, some concluding to construct a memorial on the site, others whose decision prevailed resolved to erect a house of worship thereon
Tossed with their unballasted wits in fathomless and unquiet deeps of controversies, Ahl AL-Kitab (the People of the Book) were divided in opinion relative to the number of the young men, and in the course of time, some will say: "They numbered three and their dog the fourth". Others will say: "Five, their dog the sixth", an exercise of divination, whereas others will say: "Seven, their dog the eighth". Say to them O Muhammad: "Allah, my Creator, knows best their number; it is only a few who have been given the knowledge of the number and the significance of the even". Therefore, do not involve yourself O Muhammad in the heat of their dispute but treat the subject from an objective standpoint only so as to exhibit the actual facts and never seek counsel from any of them upon the event
(It is not in mortals to command success). Therefore, do not resolve upon doing something the morrow without appending "Allah willing
That is "if it be the will of Allah". And should you forget this divine axiom, then call Allah to mind and invoke Him to guide you to a better choice than that which you had in mind "I pray and beseech You O Allah, my Creator, to guide me to a better choice than that which I had in mind
They (Ahl AL- Kitab surmised that they -the young men-) remained dormant in the Cave for three hundred years -solar calendar- with an additional nine years -lunar calendar
Say to them O Muhammad: "Allah alone knows how long they stayed in the cave. Knowledge of the mysteries of the heavens and the earth is a divine prerogative attributed only to Allah. How infinite is His vision arid how unlimited is His audition. Besides Him. People have no tutelary guardian. His Authority, Sovereignty and Command are absolute and independent and no one does He permit to go shares with Him in any measure or degree
And recite O Muhammad what has been inspired to you of the Book -the Quran- of Allah, your Creator, Whose words no one nor any expedient or any power can alter nor will you find besides Him a tutelary protector to afford you shelter
Be patient O Muhammad and rest content with those who invoke Allah's mercy and conciliation morning and evening in quest of nothing but His acceptance and His countenance speaking good will. And let not your mind's eyes turn aside from them or vacillate between them and the worldly-minded, setting your thoughts upon the ephemeral and fleeting glories of the world. Nor should you obey the one neglecting his duty to Allah and by consequence We closed his heart's ears, the one who counsels deaf and lusts after his vain desires and carries his vanity to excess that he cannot be reclaimed from a life of vice nor will he be reclaimed by Allah's grace
And say to them: "Allah's truth has come to guide us into all truth and he who wishes to acknowledge it with judgement and choice is free to do so and he who wishes to reject it is free to do so. We have prepared for the wrongful of actions a fire whose scorching and merciless flames beset them on all sides as if it were a bed having an arched canopy and covered sides. As often as they cry for help they are given a draught of boiling water like molten brass or molten lead scalding the faces; evil indeed is the drink and evil is the society
Indeed those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety are the recipients of Allah's mercy and divine reward. We never annul, cancel or render unprofitable the due return accruing from a good deed imprinted with wisdom and piety
Such persons are promised the gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow. They are adorned therein with golden bracelets and vested in green silken attire and rich brocade and reclining on dignified thrones, How excellent is the reward and how excellent is the society
Give them O Muhammad an example by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth, the example illustrating the two men; on one of them -the rich- We bestowed two orchards enclosing grape vines and surrounded by palm trees with plants in between
Both orchards yielded their produce in due season and never failed to yield all that both will hold, and in their midst We caused a river to flow with a copious stream
Abundant was the produce that he -the rich- boasted his wit and said to his fellow -man- the poor: "I have more advantages than you have; I have abundant means at command and my family and my men far exceed yours in numerosity
In his wrongful state of mind which was prejudicial to his soul, he -the rich- entered his orchard exclaiming "I cannot imagine", he said, "that this orchard will ever perish in the wreck of time
Nor do I believe that the Final Hour of Judgement will materialize and even if it does and I am sent back to Allah, my Creator, I will surely find a better one in exchange
Discoursing him on this point, his fellow the poor man said to him: "Do you not think you have presumed upon Providence and transgressed His authority" "He created you from dust then from a constituent part of fluid emitted, then He fashioned you and imparted to you the shape of a man
As for me", he continued, "He is Allah my Creator, and I do not incorporate with Him other deities
If only", the poor man added, "when you entered your orchard you had exclaimed:" " Praise be to Allah, whatever He wills shall be; no one can command success but He". "If you do see me in comparison less than you in affluence and in progeny
Perhaps Allah, my Creator, will bestow on me what is better than your orchard and He may send against it from heaven a thunder-bolt reducing it into a smooth and unproductive piece of land
or He may cause its water source sink below a reachable level that by trying to reach what is beyond your reach you reach nothing at all
Suddenly were his fruits not reaped but suffered to rot, rotting to nothing. There, he kept striking the palms of his hands reciprocally in token of violent grief caused by the loss of what he spent on it; there stood the orchard so desolate empty but of dilapidated trellises over hills of ruin. There and then he said: "I wish I had not incorporated with Allah, my Creator, other deities
Nor did he have a co-operative group to afford him help besides Allah nor could he help himself
There, it becomes evident that the only indisputable help and the only indisputable protection come only from Allah, the Omnipotent Who is truth personified, and the best Purveyor of divine rewards and the only Power that commands a successful end
Express to them O Muhammad the likeness of life here, it stands similitude exact of a cycle in which a certain round of events or phenomena is completed, thus: We send down rain water from the floor of the vault of heaven; it mingles with the product of the soil which absorbs it and thrives thereby, then it eventually withers and dries up and gets dispersed with the wind, and Allah has always been Qadirun (Omnipotent) capable of doing all things
Wealth and progeny feature the attraction and allurement exciting the pleasurable emotion of people in life here below, but what is infinite in future duration considered by Allah to have eternal consequences and hopeful reward are the deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety
The Day shall come when We put or set the mountains in motion and you see the earth bare of the natural objects it once had, and We will have thronged them -all people- to judgement, leaving not one behind
They shall be ranked before Allah in rows and be told: "Now you have come back to Us as bare, open to view and unprotected as We created you in the beginning, yet you presumed earlier upon Providence and took for granted that We would not predetermine for you a point of time
Now the Book of personal records is laid open to view and you shall see the sinful alarmed at its contents and excited with sudden fear and apprehension of danger. They express their thoughts in words, thus: "Woe betide us. This book", they say, "does not leave out a minor or a major offense unrecorded", and they shall find that every single deed, good or back is being presented and then they shall realize that Allah, your Creator, wrongs no one
For once We said to the angels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam in adoration, and the angels prostrated to Adam in comely order praise and admiration except Iblis, AL-Shaytan-to-be, who was a Jinn juxtaposed* to the angels and by consequence he disobeyed Allah, his Creator. So conditioned, do you people take him and his progeny as tutelary guardians besides Allah when they are your avowed enemy! Evil indeed is the substitute adopted by the wrongful of actions
Never did I invite them -neither these nor those nor any creature- to be present, to spectate or to be associated with the event of the creation of the heavens and the earth nor of themselves -in reference to Adam- nor did I need help nor is it befitting. It is not Allah Who would use the help of others not to mention the wicked who mislead people
The Day shall come when Allah says to the infidels: "Call forth My partners whom you presumed to share My divine nature and Omnipotence", and they shall do so, but their gods shall give back no answer, and We established between them - they and their gods- in life below the relationship leading to their final damnation
And the wicked shall see Hell open to view and realize that they shall have to cast themselves head-long therein and that there is no escape
And We have expounded and oriented Our revelations in this Quran to circumstances and requirements and We expressed many parables to bring the infidels to their senses but man has always been known to raise captions and frivolous objections about most things and tries to find fault unfairly and without good reason
What kept people back from acknowledging and accepting the spirit of truth presented to them to guide them into all truth and inspire them to invoke their Creator's mercy and forgiveness but to rest content until they are wedded to the same calamities wedding those of old or to perceive through sense of sight the torment destined to be laid upon the damned
We do not send the Messengers but to serve as spectacles and warnings, But the infidels try to seek everywhere vain proofs and groundless causes for which they are ready to contend to their life's end to refute the truth. They disdain indignantly to acknowledge My signs, My revelations and My warnings and laugh them to scorn
And who is more wrongful of actions than he who has been reminded of Allah's evident signs and revelations and shuns them, forgetting what his unclean hands have committed! The fact is We enshrouded their hearts to preclude them from exercising intellectual power or understanding and struck them deaf that nothing that enages the intellect would come to their hearing. These are those whose hearts dare rise defiant against Allah. And if you invite them to accept the spirit of truth guiding into all truth, never shall they acknowledge Providence as their guide
If Allah, your Creator. the Source of true forgiveness and divine mercy ,were to censure them for their demerits which are far above all praises of man, He would have hastened them to their painful end. But We have determined for them a point of time when they shall be reduced to a useless form and besides Allah they shall find no one to afford them refuge
Such were the towns of old whose inhabitants We did away with when they proved themselves wrongful of actions and We determined the point of time at which We carried this punishment into effect
For once did Mussa say to his attendant: "l will not give up journeying until I have reached the concourse of the two seas -said to be he juncture of the Mediterranean and the red sea, or probably the two arms of the red sea- irrespective of how long it takes, be it a year, a decade or longer
And when they had reached the junction of the two waters they forgot that they had carried a fish for their meal –Mussa was probably ordered to carry a fish-. The fish in a supernatural way, had stealthily found its way to the sea where it disappeared
And when they had journeyed beyond that spot, unaware of the incident, Mussa said to his attendant "It is time to eat; bring us our meal, we are exhausted; this journey has drained us of our strength
Do you remember the rock", asked the attendant, "to which we resorted on the way" "I had forgotten all about the fish and this was a lapse of memory effectuated by AL-Shaytan who made me forget to mention it to you. It mysteriously found its way to the sea in a most astonishing manner
This is exactly the place" said Mussa, "We were questing", they went back retracing their footsteps
There, they found one of Our devotees to whom We extended Our mercy and the initiation in mysteries and to whom We imparted of Our mystic knowledge what is transcending human comprehension
Mussa asked him: "May I follow you with the provision that you agree to impart to me of the knowledge imparted to you for the good of the wide circle of the all
He -the teacher- said to Mussa: "But you shall not be able to bear with me nor shall you quietly await the course of events
And how could you", he added, "put up with something whose significance, import or intended purpose you do not know nor do you look at it with your inward sight
But you will find me, Allah willing", said Mussa, "forbearing and will not disobey any of your instructions
Therefore", said the teacher "if you should follow me, then do not look for the how and the why and the wherefore until I have given you an account of it
And there, they made their way onward until they went on board ship in the bottom of which he -the teacher bore a hole for the purpose of sinking it-. There, did Mussa exclaim: "Have you scuttled it to drown its passengers!" "You have indeed committed yourself to an evil line of conduct
He -the teacher- said to Mussa: "Did I not tell you, you would not be able to bear with me nor show forbearance with my actions
My apologies", said Mussa, "please do not reproach me for my lapse of memory, nor impose on me an action hard to understand
Again they made their way onward until they met a youth whom he killed. There and then Mussa exclaimed: "Have you deprived an innocent soul of life when the youth committed no murder, you have indeed committed an act truly abominable
The teacher said: "Did I not tell you, you would not be able to bear with me nor show forbearance with my actions
Indeed," said Mussa: a walking interrogation -point is never a pleasant companion, "therefore if ever I should question anything you do from now on, then do not associate with me any longer; you have been patient enough to put up with my interrogation
Again they made their way onward until they came across a town where they asked the people for food but the people neither offered nor afforded welcome or entertainment to strangers and consequently denied then hospitality. So they made their way onward only to find a wall about to fall and he -the teacher- repaired it and brought it back to its original state, and there Mussa exclaimed: "Had you willed you could have charged a price for it
Now", said the teacher, "is the turning-point; we break off and separate from each other, and now", he added, "I will give you the interpretation of all the events you were unable to forbear
As to the boat", said the teacher, "it belonged to poor people –seamen- making a living, and I intended to make it defective to prevent their king, who pursues boat-owners, from capturing their boat
As to the young man, –who was evil personified- his parents are righteous people and they would have, through affection and compassion, admitted of relaxation in Allah's system of faith and worship
We decided", -Allah decrees and I am the instrument- to replace him by another child who would be a symbol of faith and stands manifest of kindness and mercy
As to the wall", the teacher said, "it constitutes a part of the property belonging to two orphan youngsters in the town and it rested directly on a treasure. Their father was a gracious man in whose heart reigned piety, and Allah, your Creator, has decreed that they reach maturity and dig out their treasure, an act of mercy vouchsafed by Allah, your Creator. You must realize that none of these incidents did I do of my own accord; there you have the interpretation of the incidents you could not forbear
They ask you O Muhammad about the Bi-horned, Zul-Qarnain! Say to them: "I will give you an account of his actions and the occurrences constituting his history in which he equally excelled
Allah says: "We confirmed him on earth and We imparted to him the knowledge of the ways and means serving a purposeful end
And he purposefully lead the way
He took the lead in an expedition toward he west until he reached a body of water -said to be the Atlantic Ocean, or more likely a mirky land abounding in swamps– where -he thought when viewing the horizon- the sun sets and where he found a -disorderly and unruly- people over whom We gave him authority. We left to him the manner of dealing with them. Either you punish them, We said or show them kindness
He set up his constitution -in the occupied territories- and accordingly he stated: "We will punish the wrongful of actions here and he wilt be left to Allah, his Creator, to impose upon him the torment laid upon the damned Hereafter
Whereas he whose heart reflects the image of religious and , spiritual virtues and his deeds wisdom and piety will be rewarded with what is best and we will treat him kindly and impose on him what he can bear with ease and what sets his mind at rest
Again, he purposefully lead the way
He conducted an expedition eastward where the sun rises until he reached an open territory -probably a desert- where -he thought when viewing the horizon- the sun rises and where the people -who were primitive- had no covering besides the sun
For thus We knew his thoughts and feelings as well as his mode of action
Again he purposefully lead the way
Until he reached a stretch of territory towered by two barriers -probably mountains- beneath which he found a people who could hardly understand a foreign word or language
They said to him -through interpreters-: "O you Zul- Qarnain, the tribes of Gog and Magog* are people who have both mischief and ill-will in their composition and they spread discord in the land. May we apportion to you a tribute in payment of raising a rampart between us, a rampart that would be invincible against all assaults
He said: "what Allah has bestowed on me of wealth and power far excels your tribute. You just help me with your laborious attempt and strenuous exertion of power and I will erect a barrier between you
Bring me blocks or sheets of iron", he said, "to fill up the space between the two natural barriers", then he said to them "Now you may subject it to fire and use your bellows to make it red hot, and when it softened he asked them for molten brass to pour on the iron to weld in solid mass
In consequence, they -the tribes- could not escalade it nor were they able to make their way through it by digging
At the end", Zul-Qarnain said thankfully: "This is a mercy graciously vouchsafed by Allah, my Creator, and when Allah's predetermined point of time comes to pass, He shall turn it to dust. The promise of Allah, my Creator, has always been the truth personified
And on the Day when the promise is fulfilled, we will leave them -the people- in an undulating conformation until the trumpet is sounded and then We assemble them all together in throngs
There and then We will bring Hell in view near enough as to be clearly seen by the infidels
Whose bodily eyes and their minds' eyes were veiled. from apprehension, knowledge or perception of My divine nature and My Omnipotence and Authority and from My signs and veritable revelations; they counselled deaf and were unwilling to open their hearts' ears
Do they -the infidels- think they do better by taking My servants as their tutelary guardians besides Me! Indeed We have prepared Hell and made it ready for the abode of the infidels whom it asserts as its own
Say to the infidels O Muhammad "shall We tell you who they are whose deeds in life have lost them the most
They are those who presumed upon Providence and conducted themselves in life according to false concepts and they thought they were doing what is right
It is these who have denied the truth of their Creator's signs and counselled deaf to His spirit of truth guiding into all truth and to His promise of Judgment at Resurrection. In consequence their hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness, and in Day of Judgement We will attach to them no importance nor shall their pleading be of weight
These are the ill-fated who justly deserve the abode in Hell by reason of their infidelity and disobedience and by consequence of laughing My revelations and signs and My Messengers to scorn
But those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety shall be the recipients of Allah's mercy and blessings. We have prepared for them the Paradise which is furnished with trellised vines and fruit trees
Wherein they would have passed through nature to Eternity admitting of no change
Say to them –the people- "If the vast body of water on the surface of the globe were ink serving the purpose of committing my Creator's words to writing, sooner would the vast body of water -now ink- be exhausted than would the words of my Creator even if we make this immense expanse twice as much
Say to them O Muhammad: "I am only a mortal like you, but I am prompted by Allah to impart to you the knowledge inspired to me. It emphasizes that your Allah is One and only, the Creator of the whole and of all in all". "Therefore, he who acknowledges Resurrection and Judgement and hopes to be welcomed in Allah's heavenly realm and be a recipient of His mercy and blessings will have to imprint his deeds with wisdom and piety and never to incorporate with Him, other deities nor invoke besides Him any
(Kaf), H. (Haa), Y. (Ya), Ain, S. (sad), and what these introductory represent and what they stand for as a natural symbol of adoration
This O Muhammad is an oration relative to the particular occasion when Allah your Creator, extended His mercy to His servant Zakariya (Zachariah)
Who once expressed his feelings and his thoughts to Allah, his Creator, in an invocatory prayer which was not openly avowed
He said: "O Allah", my Creator, " I have lived long enough to make old bones and my hair has turned white and never has my; invocatory prayer to You O Allah, my Creator, been unblest or a disadvantage
I only fear that my kindred and those connected in thought may not know, after I have gone off, how to serve Your purpose with the appropriate acts and rites, and my wife has been barren". "I pray and beseech You O Allah to give me through Your efficacious grace a descendent destined to be my successor
Who inherits the divine knowledge You imparted to me and the appropriate system of faith and worship You imbued in me and to inherit the spiritual possessions of the family of Ya'q?b (Jacob) who had the world all before them and Providence their guide, and make him O Allah my Creator, acceptable to You and a recipient of Your mercy and blessings
He was told: "O Zakariya, We relate to you the divine edict of a happy event: it is the procreation of a son named Yahya whose appellation We designated to no one before
He -Zakariya- exclaimed: "How shall I have a son when my wife has been, barren and I have been carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life
So be it", says Allah, your Creator; "this is an easy act actuated upon My swill and I have created you earlier when you were non-existent
He -Zakariya- said: "O Allah, my Creator, may I be given a token which satisfies my reason!" He was told: "What serves to indicate the fact shall be your inability to talk to people for three nights albeit you are all sound
And so he went out of the temple to his people and by making signs he intimated to them to praise the O Allah frequently and to glorify Him and extol His glorious attributes morning and evening
O Yahya", he was told, "take the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah) adhere to all that We have imparted to you and observe the code of discipline and body of regulations and hold them in esteem and hold to your promise and pay attention. Regard to it and be mindful of Our commandments", and We imbued him with wisdom in his childhood
And We imbued him with compassion and tenderness of the heart and We made piety reign in his heart and he entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
He was naturally well disposed, he exhibited a kind and affectionate disposition by his conduct to his parents and he never played the tyrant nor did his heart beat rebellious to lawful and pious resolves
And with peace and truth did his birth ever shine; peace be unto him at the encounter with death and in Day of Judgement when he is restored to life
Relate O Muhammad to the people what is narrated in the Book -the Quran- relative to Maryam when she withdrew from her family to an eastern chamber -in the Jewish Temple- to perform her religious observances
She veiled herself from them, since solitude best serves deep devotion. There We sent to her Our Spirit who disguised his identity and appeared as a human all sound
She exclaimed: "I commit myself to AL-Rahman counter to your personage for infringing upon my privacy, if indeed in your heart reigns piety
The disguised angel said: "But I am the Messenger of Allah, your Creator", I am assigned to grace you with the divine prerogative of procreating a son who is stamped with the character of sublimity, holiness and piety
How shall I possibly procreate a son", asked Maryam, when, no man has ever touched me nor did I participate in immorality
So be it", Thus said Allah, your Creator, "this is an easy act actuated upon My Will and We will make him a symbol of Our Omnipotence denoting to the people Our Uniqueness and infinite power to say to any entity "Be", and it is. " He is a mercy from Us to guide the people into all truth, and for the matter of that it has already been decreed
There, Maryam conceived not only a babe in the womb but also horror in the mind and with both she moved away to a distant place
Just to be confronted with the onset of labour, and there, the severe labour pains drove her to the nearby trunk of a palm-tree. Overwhelmed with fear mingled with grief she exclaimed: "I wish, I had died long ago and were consigned to oblivion
There and then, a cry -of triumph and joy came out from below. The new born said to her: "Do not lament the event, Allah, your Creator, has provided beneath you a brook that is moved for you
And if you shake the trunk of the palm-tree it will shower you with ripe and delicious dates in plenty
Eat then and drink", he said, and compose your countenance and let your eyes speak content. Should you come across anyone of the people, you just say: "I vowed to Allah to fast from talking and to consecrate the day in religious observance, pray to Him and converse with Him, glorify Him and extol His glorious attributes; by consequence I will not give a speaking tongue today to a human being
She carried the babe taking him home to her people who exclaimed: "O Maryam," they said, "you have committed yourself to an evil line of conduct of grave consequence
O Maryam", they added, "sister of Har?n (Aaron) -in priesthood - never was your father a man of evil nor was your mother immoral
She simply pointed her finger at him -the babe- with an intimation, as it were, that they ask or speak to him. But they exclaimed: "How in Allah's Name can we discourse with a new born babe
I am", said the babe -Isa- "a devout servant of Allah Who shall entrust me with His Book -the Bible- and confer on me the prerogative of Prophethood
He conferred on me benediction that I will be blessed wherever I may be, and He has enjoined me, for as long as I live, the practice of praying to Him and of Zakat (almsgiving), -for alms are but the vehicles of prayer
He emphasized that I should be kind and dutiful to my mother, and He excluded tyranny and depravity from my nature
Peace be upon me the day I was born and the day I encounter death and in Day of Judgement when I am restored to life
This is Isa, the son of Maryam, declaring the truth of his own eventful birth. He was called into existence as stated in divine truth and not in the manner which Ahl AL –Kitab maintain by disputation and will die for it
It is never becoming that Allah should adopt or beget a son. Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. When He determines no matter what, He only says "Be" and it is
Allah is my Creator and your Creator", Isa continued, "He exacts obedience and submission from the whole and from all in all, and so worship him with appropriate acts and rites, for this is the path of righteousness leading directly to Him
Nevertheless the various sects found a cause for which they were ready to contend to their life's end. Woe betide them who will not acknowledge Allah's Oneness, Uniqueness and Absoluteness. How distressful shall be the stormy scene they shall have to encounter on a Momentous Day
How acute shall be their vision and their hearing on the Day they assemble before Us in Day of Judgement when the wrongful of actions shall realize their grave error
Warn them O Muhammad –the wrongful of actions- of the Day when long shall they sigh as the die is cast, being already convicted by reason of their negligence of Allah's statutes and their disbelief in Him and in His Messengers
They do not seem to realize that it is We Who inherit the earth and the whole and all in all thereon; they all return back to Us
Narrate O Muhammad to the people what is discoursed in the Book- the Quran- relative to Ibrahim (Abraham) who was a man who kept Allah's truth so pure, and his words and his deeds together accorded; he was a Prophet
For once he asked his father: "O father, why do you revere and adore with appropriate acts and rites objects that are deaf and blind and can avail you absolutely nothing
O father", he continued, "I am a recipient of divine knowledge imparted to me and not imparted to you. Should you follow Me. I will guide you to the path of righteousness, the path of Allah
My father", he said, "do not take AL-Shaytan (Satan) as a guide and espouse his cause. He incites you to regard idols with reverence and veneration and feelings akin to worship". "Keep in mind that he exercised open and determined defiance of Allah, AL-Rahman and resisted His Authority
O father", he added, "I have an uneasy sense of the probability of a retributive punishment which might be assigned to you from AL-Rahman in requital of your submission to AL-Shaytan, and that shall bring you closer to him in alliance and intimacy
There, the father exclaimed: "Do you Ibrahim drop my gods into oblivion and dismiss them as unfit for worship"! "unless you desist" he added, "from disqualifying them and treating them as of no importance, I promise I will pelt you with stones. You had better keep away for sometime so that you do not come within the measure of my wrath and until I have forgotten the incident
Peace be upon you O father", Said Ibrahim, "I will invoke Allah on your behalf for mercy and forgiveness; Allah has always been Merciful and gracious to me
Meanwhile I will withdraw from your society and remove myself from your atmosphere of idolatry which you profess besides the faith in Allah". "I will devote my act of worship to Him alone and invoke Him for forgiveness and look forward to His mercy; perhaps my hopes will not be doomed to disappointment
When he removed himself from their society and from their idols which they invoked besides Allah, We bestowed on him Ishaq (Isaac) and Ya'q?b each of whom We graced with the prerogative of Prophethood
We extended to them Our mercy and made all grace abound in them and We savoured their speaking tongue with prudence and truth that it was honoured in the wide circle of the all
You may narrate to them O Muhammad what is discoursed in tThe Book -the Quran- relative to M?ssa (Moses) who was chosen for his virtuousness and purity; he was a Messenger endowed with the prerogative of Prophethood
We called him from the right side of the Mount (Sinai) and We brought him in a proximate position to honour him and to converse with him upon mystic matters
We mercifully assigned him an adjutor, his brother Har?n whom We proclaimed a Prophet
Also, narrate O Muhammad to the people what is discoursed in the Book -the Quran- relative to Ismail who was true-hearted, true to his promise, and his words and his deeds together accorded; he was a Messenger endowed with the prerogative of Prophethood
He always enjoined his family and his people the practice of praying to Allah and the religious duty of Zakat, and he was very near and well pleasing to Allah, his Creator
And narrate O Muhammad to the people what is discoursed in the Book -the Quran- relative to Idris, -possibly he was Ozoris or he was not, or he was Enoch or was not and it seems that he was sent before Ibrahim-. He was a man who kept Allah's truth so pure and his words together with his deeds accorded ,he was a Prophet
We exalted him and ennobled him and graced him with a lofty position
These aforementioned were among the prophets on whom Allah conferred His blessings and in whom all His grace abounded. They were the posterity of Adam and of those whom We carried with N?h (Noah) in the Ark and of the posterity of Ibrahim and Ismail and of the posterity of those whom We guided into all truth and chose to promote the divine knowledge. When Allah's revelations were recited to them they fell prostrate in adoration and were moved with reverential awe which prompted weeping and they wept out their eyes and their hearts
(Pitifully) they were followed by generations who neglected the act of worship, and lusted after the worthless, and in vanity they wasted their days. But as there came the day to those of old, the day will come to those of today and shall come to those-to-come when they shall taste the evil consequence here, and worse shall it be Hereafter
But excluded are those who in lowliest plight repentant stood and were wise enough to acknowledge Allah, their Creator, and their hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety. These and such persons shall with great cordiality receive the welcome in Paradise, and never shall they be wronged in one way or another
Paradise which is pictured in the Garden of Eden AL-Rahman has promised to His devoted servants who apprehend it mentally even though hitherto unseen. Indeed, His promise is truth personified and shall come to pass
No vain discourse shall they hear therein, but peace shall forever shine and in Allah's Name shall they be greeted with the formula of good will, good wishes and respect "Peace", and they shall be provided with victuals, eatables and drinkables morning and evening
Such is the paradise which shall be the eternal right to those of Our devout servants in whose hearts reigned piety
We -The Angels- do not just come down as We please. We only come down at Allah's command, to Him belong all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between, and never is Allah, your Creator, forgetful
Allah is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and of all that is between, therefore, worship Him and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, and exercise patience in religious observance and in face of difficulties and hindrances. Think but this: do you know of any who shares His divine nature and His divine attributes
Yet man says to himself: "Would I be resurrected and be restored to life after I have long been dead
Does man not remember that We created him in the beginning when he was absolutely nothing and nonexistent
By Allah, your Creator, We will throng them together with those who played the devil and with those with characteristics befitting AL-Shaytan and throng them all on their knees girdling round Hell
Then We will haul up from every sect those who were disobedient and rebellious against AL-Rahman the most
We do know quite well the most deserving among the wide circle of the all to the torment to be laid upon the damned in Hell
None of you people but shall go by it -the confines of Hell-, an inevitable event that is promised by Allah and incumbent upon Him and no one is destined to escape it
There, will We lead safely and deliver those who entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and leave to it down on their knees the wrongful of actions whom it asserts as her own
When Our revelations are recited to them, revelations distinctly expressing all that is meant leaving nothing merely implied, they exclaim: "which of the two parties" they ask, "holds a high position in the social scale and status and in society, the nobility who do not follow Muhammad or the no-bodies who follow him
They fail to realize how countless were the generations We destroyed, generations who came to this world before them and were more affluent and enjoyed more splendour
Say to them -The infidels- O Muhammad "Those who are satisfied with their state of loss in the maze of error shall experience more of it. Allah shall give them enough rope to allow them free scope of action to commit themselves until the encounter with the promised punishment either at the hands of the Muslims here below or in Day hi Judgement Hereafter. There and then, shall they realize who are in the most grievous and dreaded state and have the lesser and weaker forces
But those who chose the path of righteousness and Providence their guide shall Allah make circumstances favourable to them to think better and do better wherefore the everlasting deeds of wisdom and piety are esteemed by Allah as most rewarding and of note and so much consequence
Do you see O Muhammad the one* who totally rejects Our revelations and denies the Hereafter as well as Our convincing signs, and mockingly says to his debtee**: "l will be given Hereafter, plenty and live in affluence and have progeny in numerosity then I will pay you the debt
How insolent to presume upon Providence! Has he been given divine knowledge of the unknown or the ability to realize the unseen or has he entered into a covenant with Allah, AL-Rahman
Never, but he had better restrain himself from uttering words conveying absurdities. We will relate in writing and record all that he says and prolong the punishment of his soul which welcomes wrongs, to such an extent as he never portrayed in his mind
We will take possession of all that he said he would have, and he comes back to Us all alone
They -the infidels- chose to take besides Allah false gods through whom they seek predominance and glory here and intercession Hereafter
Never, but they shall disclaim knowledge of their zealous devotion and exercise active opposition against them, and as enemies they -the false gods- shall obtain their end
Do you look O Muhammad into the way We use the satanic! We send them against the infidels to rouse up their vain desires and incite them to do evil
Therefore, do not call O Muhammad upon Allah to hasten the retributive punishment unto them. We keep count of their misdeeds and all their pursuits of the world during their numbered days here, and they shall have much to answer for Hereafter
The Day shall come when the faithful are assembled before AL-Rahman in a presentable and dignified manner
And We drive the sinful to Hell like thirsty cattle
No one shall have the advantage nor the power of intercession except him who has been promised to this effect by AL-Rahman
They say: "Allah, AL-Rahman has taken up, adopted or begotten a son
You blasphemers have instituted a notion that is indeed monstrous, enormous anal atrocious
A notion indeed shocking. Its impact makes the heavens tremble and almost tear apart asunder and the earth quakes and almost parts asunder and the mountains quiver and almost crumble
that they ascribe to AL-Rahman a son
when it is absolutely unbecoming nor is it consonant with His Supreme Majesty that He should take up, adopt or beget a son
that is besides the fact that there is not one single creature in the heavens and on earth but shall come back to stand before AL-Rahman as a servant submitting to His Authority and surrendering himself or itself to Judgement
He has counted them and ascertained their number
All and each shall present himself or itself to AL-Rahman singly
But not those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety. They shall be the recipients of Allah's mercy. AL-Rahman shall overshadow them with His gracious wing and impart to them His loving care
We have revealed it -the Quran- in a language conducive to ease, worded in your own tongue O Muhammad in order to use it when you announce joyful tidings to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and to warn the disdainful who are ready to contend to their life's end
How many generations before them have We reduced to a useless form. Look around and see if you can find any one of them or hear their voice, be it uttered loudly or under their breath
(Ta), H. (Ha) the Surah Opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
We have not revealed to you O Muhammad the Quran to cause you hardship nor to put you to trouble
But to serve as a reminder to those who keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
A disclosure of divine knowledge to man from Him, AL-Rahman Who Created the earth and the heavens of the imposing altitude
AL-Rahman Who set Himself on the Throne of supremacy and dominion , of grace and mercy
AL-Rahman to Whom belong all that is in the heavens and on earth and all that is between, all that lies in the depths below the face of the earth and of all other planets
If you express your thoughts or declare your mind aloud, Allah does know what is suggested secretly to the mind and what man thinks but unwilling to avow
He is Allah, there is no Ilah but He; to Him belong, the unique and Commendable attributes
And now, have you been informed O Muhammad of the narrative of Mussa
He saw a fire from far**, He said to his family: "You stay here; I have just
And when he reached the destined spot, he was called to: "O Mussa", Allah said
I am Allah, your Creator; you are in My Presence, therefore, take off your shoes, you are in The Sacred Valley, Tuwa
And I have chosen you to convey My divine message, therefore, listen carefully to all that shall be inspired to you
I am Allah, there is no Ilah but I, therefore, worship Me and adore Me with the appropriate acts and rites and observe the act of divine worship applying remembrance to Me
The predetermined Eventful Hour shall inevitably come to pass, I almost keep it from the knowledge of others so that each soul be requited with what is commensurate with its deeds
Therefore do not let those who reject the idea of Resurrection and lust after vanity influence your conduct, your belief or your trust in Me lest you suffer spiritual death and moral ruin
And", Allah asked: "What is that you hold in your right hand O Mussa
It is my staff", Mussa said, "I lean on and with it I beat the smaller bushes, the shrubs and the trees to furnish my sheep with food in addition to using it for other purposes
Drop it O Mussa. " Allah Said
And when Mussa did, the staff was instantaneously transformed into a serpent in motion
Pick it up O Mussa", Allah said " and do not be afraid; We will make it go back to its original state
Draw your hand* O Mussa close to your side, it shall come out transfigured in a radiance of white divine light unharmed and all sound; another sign
This is just to make you witness personally Our Omnipotence as featured in what We show you of Our signs so that you satisfy your reason, have peace of mind and rest assured and be capable of carrying the great responsibility of fulfilling your obligation
Go to Pharaoh", Allah said, "he has transgressed all bounds
Mussa prayed: "Solace me O Allah, my Creator, and make my breast responsive to the joyful thought of performing my duty and make my spirit thirsty for knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light
And make my task go easily
And loosen my tongue and untie its impeding knot to allow me free expression
So that they understand my discourse and comprehend all that I say
And appoint for me a minister from my family
Harun (Aaron), my brother
To exert influence, power and effect and to have security of position
To engage him in the conduct of my cause, Your cause, and interchange with him opinions, consultation and deliberation of action
So that much we glorify You and extoll Your glorious attributes
And much We think of You
For, You have regarded us with an eye of favour
And there," Allah said, "you are granted your humble request Q Mussa
And We have been gracious to you O Mussa", Allah said, "on another occasion
When We inspired a course of action to your mother and actuated her with what she would do to save your life
Put the child in the chest", We said, "and throw the chest into the river, the waves will drive the chest to the bank and there shall he be picked up by a common enemy of Mine and of his". And I endowed you with the prerogative of amiability and I had an eye upon you so that you grow and develop under My observation
Your sister", Allah said, "marches to the gate of the Palace and says to the household: "shall I inform you of an acceptable woman who would nurse and rear the child! There, We returned you to your mother so that she would be delighted and her eyes speak content and she would take off the robe of grief". "Moreover, you killed a man -unintentionally when helping the Israelite against the Egyptian- (Surah 28, V.19), and We relieved you and freed you of the anguish and in various ways did We put you to straits" "And by consequence you stayed for a number of years among the Madianites, then you were impelled upon My will to come to serve Me here as I had planned O Mussa
And I made you", Allah said, "what you are for My purpose, O Mussa
Now, you go together with your brother Harun equipped with My divine signs betokening My Omnipotence and Authority and slack not Me nor My words to remember
Go to Pharaoh", Allah added, " he has transgressed all bounds and played the tyrant
And speak gently to him, so that he might hopefully be brought to his senses and entertain a profound reverence for Allah
They Mussa and Harun said: "O Allah, our Creator, we fear he might show a strong dislike to us and involve in some notion repugnant to the moral sense or he might play the blasphemer, the persecutor and the tyrant
Do not be afraid ever", Allah said, "I am with you all along, I am Omnipresent with unlimited audition and I see all that is being done
Go to him and say": "We are Messengers of Allah, your Creator, We ask you to release the children of Israel from bondage and to send them with us and not to torture them. We have brought you an evident sign from Allah, your Creator, and peace be upon those who have the world all before them and Providence their guide
We have been inspired and prompted by Allah", they continued, " to indicate that punishment shall befall whoever suspects Allah's Messengers of falsehood and turns his back upon Allah's message
There, said Pharaoh defiantly: " Who is your Ilah, O Mussa
Our Allah, The Creator", "They said," "is He Who gave form, shape and features to every entity He created and vested each entity With its qualities and attributes guiding each creature to its inherent role in life
What about the earlier generations!" asked Pharaoh, "and what say you to that
Only Allah knows what happened to them", they said " knowledge of the hidden is an attribute of Him, Our Creator, Who puts everything on record. and never goes wrong nor does He forget
He is it Who made the earth a liveable place* suitable for your livelihood and furnished it with paths, roads and channels, and He sent from the floor of the vault of heaven water, the means of producing pairs of diverse plants
To eat therefrom and put cattle to pasture. Indeed, these are tokens representing convincing divine evidence, tokens symbolic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, giving insight to those who grasp with the mind
From the earth We created you and back to it We will bring you -at death-, and out of it will We bring you again -in Day of Judgement
We presented Pharaoh with all Our evident and convincing signs but he simply denied them and counselled deaf and suspected Mussa of falsehood
He said to him: "Have you come back to us, to oust us out of our land by your magic, O Mussa
We will not bend to your magic art", "and We will meet your threats with defiance and your sorcery with a similar art having an over -mastering influence-". "Therefore," added Pharaoh, make a tryst neither We nor you shall fail to keep and the place where we meet shall be equidistant and overt
The time", said Mussa, "is your festive day and the place is where people are thronged for festive celebration in the forenoon
There, Pharaoh drew himself away and concerted an insurrection of necromancers and came back
Woe betide you", said Mussa to the magicians, "do not devise falsehood against Allah lest He should uproot you by a torment He lays upon the damned. The hopes of those who devise falsehood are doomed to disappointment
There and then did the sorcerers dispute and debate their plan among themselves in a secret counsel
They concluded, thus; "these two men Mussa and Harun are necromancers planning to drive you people out of your land by their magic and do away with your exemplar constitution
Therefore", they added, "gather up your thoughts and muster your wits to work out an over -mastering plan and come in imposing lines, for he who gains the upper hand shall be the winner
Face to face with Mussa, they said to him: "Would you like to cast down your staff first or shall we cast ours first
But", Mussa said, "you cast first", and there, their ropes and their rods seemed as though they were living serpents in motion
A wave of terror swept over Mussa in his innermost being
Allah inspired to him: "Do not be alarmed O Mussa", "nor be pervaded with fear. You have mastery over them and indeed you have the upper hand
He added, "Cast down what you hold in your right hand. It shall swallow up all that they laid in fakes. Indeed, all they presented was simply an optical illusion made manifest by sorcerers, and no sorcerer can accomplish a useful purpose nor succeed in reaching a positive end no matter whence he came
There and then fell the necromancers prostrate in adoration and they prostrated their reason to divine revelation and said: "We do recognize Allah, the Creator, of Mussa and Harun
Have you conformed your will" said Pharaoh, "to the will of the Ilah of Mussa before I permit you to do so! Indeed it is your chief who taught you magic has misled you". Therefore, you just wait. I will amputate your hands and feet on opposite sides and I will have you all crucified on the trunks of palm - trees, and you shall come to know which of us, can inflict punishment to a greater degree, agonizing, and more lasting to make you live in Hell on earth
The magicians said to Pharaoh: "We will not look with favour on your system of faith in preference to the truth and the enlightenment we have received; nor in preference to Him Who created us. Therefore, decide what you will; you can only sit in judgement here below
We have recognized Allah", they said, "and conformed our will to His will; may He forgive us our sins and the sinful act of magic you forced us to do" "Allah is indeed the best purpose for which we are destined and He is Eternal
Indeed, he who presents himself to Allah, his Creator, in Day of Judgement invested with crime, shall be destined to Hell wherein he neither dies nor lives
Whereas he who presents himself then with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety shall he and such persons be rewarded with the highest and most dignified places in the social scale of life Hereafter
They shall be rewarded with the abode in the Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity. This is the reward of those who have cleansed themselves from moral and spiritual defilement and purposed to meet their Creator pure in heart
Meanwhile, We inspired Mussa to conduct My servants by night to the sea and to strike for them a dry path across and We assured him, thus: "You shall not be overtaken by Pharaoh and his people. They shall not catch up with you nor should you fear them
Pharaoh in command of his troops went in pursuit of Mussa and his people whom he considered as enemies to the community of nature, but they were overwhelmed with the sea water which overpowered them
In effect what Pharaoh actually did was that he fooled his people, led them astray and never did he really guide them to a path of righteousness
O Children of Israel: We delivered you from your enemy and We ordained for you the divine assignation -through Mussa on the right side of Mount Sinai to receive the commandments- and We provisioned you with Al Manna, the continual dew of the blessed victuals, and with the Quails
And We said to you: Eat of the worthy victuals We provisioned you, do not transgress nor carry anything to excess lest you should come within the measure of My wrath, for, he who suffers My wrath sways his destiny and incurs spiritual death and moral ruin
However, I am indeed Forgiving; I extend forgiveness to him whose heart reflects the image of religious and spiritual virtues and his deeds wisdom and piety and Providence his guide
And", Allah asked, "what made you hasten on O Mussa and outstrip your` people -the seventy elders who were to accompany him
They are tailing me on" Mussa said "but I hastened on to You O Allah my Creator, so that You might be pleased with me
We have tested your people O Mussa" Allah said, after you left. They succumbed to Samiri who led them astray
And there, Mussa returned to his people provoked to wrath and grieved indeed. He said to them: "My people, did Allah, your Creator, not afford you ground of expectation and led you to expect a handsome promise!" "Did you believe it took too long or did you intend to come within the measure of His wrath and by consequence you failed to keep your promise to me -to remain faithful
We did not break our promise of our own accord," they said, "but we were made to carry loads of ornaments -of Egyptian women- which we thought portend evil and We threw them in the fire to get rid of them and so did Samiri
And he fashioned it -the melted gold- in the shape of a calf's body -like the bull of Osiris in the city of Memphis, Egypt- which mowed like cattle when down wind. No sooner did they see a golden Calf emitting a sound than they forgot Allah Who delivered them and gave themselves up to the calf as the object of worship saying to each other: "This is your Ilah, the Ilah of Mussa whom he forgot, and by consequence he missed his way
Did they not see that it was mute, unable to respond to their discourse nor could it cause them harm nor afford them help
Harun had said to them earlier: "O my people, be careful, you have, consented to this enticement while your Allah is the Creator, AL-Rahman; therefore, follow me and obey my command
But they said to him: "We will not renounce our devotion to it -the calf- until Mussa comes back to us
And when Mussa returned, he said to Harun: "What kept you Harun from acting when you saw them deviated in mind and wandering from the path of righteousness
What hindered you" Mussa added, "from following my instructions and fulfilling your obligation; have you disobeyed my command
O son of my mother", Harun said, "do not drag me by the beard nor by the head. I was afraid you would say I have set the children of Israel at variance and did not listen to your instructions
Turning to the Samiri, Mussa ask: "What is on your mind O Samiri
I have seen", said Samiri, "what they failed to see -meaning the Spirit Jabril (Gabriel)- and so I took a handful of dust from the track of the Messenger of Allah and I tossed it toward the calf, for so did my soul prompt me -a made- up excuse for his unforgivable sinful act
Go away", Mussa said, you shall be punished in this life by isolation -like a terrible contagion, a way of punishing a grave sin in the Mosaic law- and you shall have a conviction of this fact that you shall say " I am a touch -me- not", that is besides the promised punishment which shall not fail nor shall you be able to escape it Hereafter" "And now", Mussa added, "look at your god to which you appropriated yourself and applied it exclusively as if by a vow; We will burn it to the melting point -or to ashes- and scatter it and disseminate it in the sea
Indeed", Mussa said, "your Allah is the One Who is the Creator; there is no Ilah but He; His knowledge is absolute, it embraces the whole and all in all
Thus do We relate to you O Muhammad narratives of some of the proceeding generations, and We have given you by Our grace from Our realm in heaven a Book -Quran- helping you and the wide circle of the all to keep Allah in mind and to ponder His marvels
A Quran, a spirit of truth guiding into all truth, and he who rejects it or turns his back upon it will have rejected Allah's mercy and he shall suffer the heavy burden he carries in Day of Judgement
There and then he and such persons will have passed through nature to eternal suffering and evil and indeed tormenting to them shall this burden be
The Day shall come when the trumpet is sounded and We throng the sinful who shall look blue, being affected with terror, distress and anxiety
They whisper to each other guessing their duration in life below and some think it was so short that it could not have been more than ten days
We know best what they discourse, but those among them with veracious insight will say: "You sojourned no more than one day
And they ask you O Muhammad about the mountains, say to them "Allah, my Creator, shall uproot them to extirpation
So that He leaves them leveled with the ground smooth - faced surface
Wherefore you cannot see curves, elevations nor depressions
There and then shall all resurrected beings faithfully follow the announcer -the angel Israfil- who marches straight on, and all voices and sounds are humbled and die away that you can only hear the soft and fair sound of their foot-steps treading the straight path
This is the Day when no intercession shall be accepted from anyone on behalf of another except from him who is granted permission from Allah AL-Rahman on the basis of his virtuous attributes and his pleading is acceptable to Him
He knows fully well what they have brought of doings or handiwork into His presence and He knows their past which they do not presently comprehend with their minds nor do they know what Allah has for them in store
All countenances shall express humility before Him, the Eternal, the Omnipotent Who preserves existence. But defeated and miserably disappointed of their expectations shall be those who bear the burden of iniquity and wrongful actions
And he who imprints his deeds with wisdom and piety and his heart with religious and spiritual virtues shall not fear injustice nor abridgement or privileges
Thus have We revealed it -the Quran- in the Arabic literary from and therein We expounded enough warnings that they may hopefully keep in awe of Allah or keep Him in mind and lift to Him their inward sight
Exalted be Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes, the Supreme Sovereign, the Truth personified. Do not rush O Muhammad to recite the Quran before the inspired passage is completed -that is while the Angel Jebril is imparting the divine revelation- and invoke Allah to augment your knowledge, thus: "May I ask You O Allah, my Creator, to advance my knowledge
We entered into a covenant with Adam but he forgot and We found him irresolute; he lacked firmness of purpose
We said to the angles: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam in adoration", and the angels prostrated to Adam in comely order, praise and admiration except Iblis AL-Shaytan- to- be- who aspersed with calumny and declined with inordinate self-esteem
And there, We said to Adam: "This - Iblis - is an avowed enemy to you and to your wife; let him not be the cause of ousting you from Paradise wherefore you suffer
You may rest assured He, Allah added, "that herein never shall you suffer hunger nor go naked
Nor shall you suffer thirst nor be exposed to the parching heat of the sun
But AL-Shaytan sneakingly whispered to him, instigating evil. He said to Adam: "Shall I show you the tree of eternity and the kingdom which suffers no declension
Deceived by AL-Shaytan's allurement and consenting to his enticement, they both ate of the tree and there, their private parts were exposed wherefore they realized how shameful this was. They kept collecting leaves from the trees of Paradise -to cover their naked bodies which aroused their sense of shame- and there, has Adam disobeyed Allah, His Creator, and strayed from the path of righteousness
But Allah, his Creator, reclaimed him and relented in mercy to him and guided him to the path of righteousness
upon Our Command", Allah said "We down both of you upon, together with AL- Shaytan from hence with mutual enmity to each other" - "You shall receive from Me the spirit of truth guiding into all truth, and he who follows the path of righteousness and Providence his guide shall not err nor suffer spiritual death nor moral ruin
And he who turns his back upon My spirit of truth that guides into all truth and does not keep Me in mind shall live a life of misery and hardness of fate and circumstances and We throng him in Day of Judgement as blind, lacking in intellectual, moral and spiritual perception as he was in life
Then shall he say: "O Allah, my Creator, wherefore You thronged me blind when in life I was able to see and to argue and defend myself
Like this", Allah says, "you blinded yourself and closed your heart's ears and mind's eyes to Our revelations and authoritative signs and you consigned them to oblivion and by consequence you are, this Day, forgotten, neglected and disregarded
Thus do We requite him who has exceeded his limitations and carried things to excess and did not acknowledge Allah's revelations and authoritative signs, and the punishment Hereafter is indeed more severe and more lasting
Do they not perceive O Muhammad mentally and by sight the significance of Allah's penalties! and have they failed to realize how many generations before them did We reduce to a useless form? They tread their dwellings they once occupied and they see with their own eyes the consequence of disobeying Allah. Indeed such outcome is emblematic of Allah's signs recognized by people of insight
Had it not been for Allah's word proclaimed beforehand -to put punishment in respite- it would have been timely to plant their Hereafter in the now, but We grant them respite up to a predetermined point of time
Therefore, be patient O Muhammad and put up with what they insolently and defiantly say, and praise Allah, your Creator, and extol His glorious attributes before sunrise and before sunset and some time during the night and at both ends of the day so that you may hopefully be pleased with Allah's distinguished reward
And do not direct your sight wistfully O Muhammad at the advantages We gave to some among the various sects; it is the flower of life below and it is a means of trial. It is the gist with which We test their response and their behaviour, whereas the blessed victual provisioned by Allah Hereafter is excellence personified and more lasting
And enjoin your family to observe the act of worship and you persevere in observing it and in maintaining your piety. We do not expect you to provide sustenance. It is We Who provide for you and for all, and the happy ending is the conclusion of piety
And they -the infidels- insolently and defiantly say; If only he -the Prophet- presents us with a sign -other than the Quran- from Allah, his Creator, -to evince both his wisdom and the truth of his mission-! Have they not been presented with enough Authoritative signs in former Scriptures which foretold also future events
If We had reduced them to a useless form before this Book -the Quran- was revealed, they would have said: "O Allah, our Creator, if only You had sent to us a Messenger with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth we would have acknowledged Your revelations and authoritative signs and followed Your path of righteousness before We were humbled and put to shame
Say to them O Muhammad: "Each of us awaits his end and what lies for him in store; therefore, you wait -until The Eventful Day comes to pass- and then you shall come to know which of us had followed the path of righteousness and who had the world all before them and Providence their guide
Peoples' Day of Judgement is approaching, yet they pay no attention, unwilling to receive it with consenting minds nor agree to consider it the one fact that destroys fiction
No fresh divine message or a warning comes to them from Allah, their Creator, but they listen to it mockingly and laugh it to scorn
Their hearts' ears are closed for revelation but open for mockery and amusement -the happiness of those who cannot think- Being wrongful of actions, they say in their secret counsel: "Is he Muhammad not human like yourselves, and so will you accede to the magic he is able to manifest in his discourse when you have insight of the mind and eyesight of the body
Having known by inspiration the conclusion of their secret counsel- the Prophet said: "Allah, my Creator, knows all that is being said or discoursed in the heavens and on earth; He is AL-Sami' (the Omnipresent with unlimited audition and AL-'Alim (the Omniscient)
They -the infidels- went further and fared worse -in their description of the Quran and of the Prophet They said: "confused dreams, no, but he forged it, no, but he is a poet; he must present us with a miraculous sign like those with which were equipped the prophets of old
In response to their insolence and defiance-, Allah says: Miraculous signs were presented to generations before them whom We reduced to a useless form on account of their rejection and denial of divine truth, therefore, what chance is there that these infidels will recognize Allah and in Him they will believe
We never sent and inspired before you O Muhammad but men chosen from among the town dwellers whose deeds were natural to man, therefore, you -infidels- may ask those who are well versed in the antecedent Scriptures -Jews and Christians- if indeed you do not know
Nor did We make their material being -the body- able to survive without consuming food nor were they destined to escape death or last forever
And We fulfilled Our promise to them and delivered them out of danger together with whom We willed and We reduced the transgressors to a useless from
And We have sent down to you people a Book -the Quran- serving as a reminder to you in every respect and in due time will it praise your name to fame that you will be mentioned by others with admiration, adoration, and commendation; will you not understand
And think but this: how many towns, whose inhabitants were wrongful of actions, did We destroy and replace by other people
And when they sensed Our wrath approaching, in vain for their life, they fled to other places
In irony they were told-: do not flee but go back to your lustful life and to your dwellings; you may have much to answer for
There and then they exclaimed, thus: Woe betide us, we were indeed wrongful of actions
They kept bewailing their misfortune until We reduced them to a useless form like reaped field of corn
We never created the heavens and the earth and all that is between just for fun
Had We purposed to have fun or diversion We would have had recourse to what We have in Our heaven's realm if indeed We meant to do so
But what befits Our Supremacy is to dash fiction and falsehood with truth so that it is erased and vanished wherefore woe betide you for what you insolently ascribe to Allah
And to Allah alone belong all that is in the heavens and on earth, and those serving in His realm of heaven do not pride themselves nor show inordinate self- esteem for serving Him and prostrating to Him in adoration nor do they ever grow weary
They .celebrate and glorify their Creator and extol His glorious attributes night and day and they never lose vigour, grow dull nor do they lose interest
Could it be that they- the idolaters-have taken earthly objects of worship who can raise the dead and restore them to life
Indeed, if there be Ilahs other than Allah or sharing His divine nature and attributes, the heavens and the earth would have become corrupt and been ruined. Therefore, praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes the sole Sovereign of the Supreme Throne. He is far above what they ascribe to Him
He is never questioned or examined judicially for whatever He does, whereas they as a whole shall have much to answer for
Or have they taken besides Allah, the Creator, other gods which were indicated to them in previous Scriptures? if so, say to them O Muhammad: "Give us convincing evidence to this effect. This Quran is the message followed by my fellows in faith and before it were the Scriptures followed by those of old. And no where do we final but monotheisms" But indeed most of them fail to comprehend the truth and so they do not receive it with consenting minds
Nor did We send a Messenger before you O Muhammad but We inspired him with the truth clearly indicating that there is no Ilah but I the Creator, therefore worship Me and adore Me with appropriate acts and rites and regard Me with extreme devotion
And they blasphemously say: " Allah has taken up, adopted or begotten a son. Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes, They -the angels- are but honoured and distinguished worshippers
Never do they speak before Him unless permitted or commanded to do so; similarly conditioned are their acts
He knows all that is before them and all that is behind them and they never intercede on behalf of anyone except on behalf of those approved by Him, those to whom He intends to be gracious. The angels- keep in awe of Him on account of the deep veneration and the profound reverence dutiful to Him
And should any of them -angels or- men- claim god-ship besides Allah, then he is bound to Hell, for thus do We requite the wrongful of actions
Do the infidels who deny Allah not see into the creation of the universe - the heavens and the earth-! Both were one mass and We split them asunder* and We made every living being dependent upon water**. We made it an essential component or constituent of every living cell. Will they -the infidels- not be brought to their senses and realize that there is a Creator
And We furnished the earth with firm stays Mountains* placed in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, to stabilize it lest it should sway you from side to side or in all directions and We furnished it with paths, roads, channels, routes by land and water and between mountains so that they may be guided in their journeys between the different places
And We made the heavens with their spheres and regions which resemble a vast vault or canopy overarching and protecting the earth*, being itself protected, maintained, safeguarded and well preserved. Yet they are oblivious of their marvels –stability, regularity, precision, immensity, and what it confers of protection- and fail to ascribe them to their maker Who is Allah
And He is it Who created the night and the day, the sun and the moon, each describing its own orbit
And never did We destine a human being before you O Muhammad to escape death or live forever -you are no exception-. Is it then that when you die they shall live forever
Every Soul -no exception- shall taste death and We test you -people- by wedding you to calamities and by making Our grace abound in you to determine your true belief and inclination, your spiritual and moral attributes, your accomplishments, attainments and your way and course of acting, then in the end shall all of you be brought back to Us
And when the infidels see you O Muhammad they receive you with nothing but disdain and scorn which ride sparkling in their eyes and they say: "Is this the one who blasphemes your gods! And when Al Rahman is mentioned, their countenances speak blasphemy against Him
Man has been created with the innate propensity to be unduly hasty of spirit; I will exhibit to you My acts and My marvels serving to demonstrate divine power and authority, therefore, do not ask Me to hasten them on
And yet they -the infidels- ask the Muslims: "When shall that promised punishment come to pass if indeed you declare the truth
If only these infidels who deny Allah knew that there shall come a time when they shall not be able to avert the blazing fire from their faces nor from their backs nor shall they be afforded help
It shall surprise them. Pale and dumb, they shall stand confused and confounded unable to avert it nor shall they be granted respite
Messengers who were sent before you O Muhammad were also bombarded with foul epithets, the infidels mocked them and gave them a lick with the rough side of their tongues and called them everything they could lay their tongues to. In consequence were the mockers beset on all sides by the same material and immaterial things they had turned in to ridicule
Say to them: "Who can defend you by night and/or by day from AL- Rahman if His wrath speaks thunder". But they are unwilling to listen to divine Revelation nor to Allah's warning and they are habitually opposed to the mention of His attributes
Or have they gods, besides Him, who can defend them! They -the gods- are themselves unable to hold their own nor can they defend themselves, let alone defending others should We decide that they perish
We granted these people together with their fathers comfort and enjoyment and all that advantaged them of Our blessings in life as long as they lived. Do they not see that We reduce their territories and straiten their outlying borders -by rapid progress of Islam-. is it then they who are the winners or the conquerors
(Say to them O Muhammad: "I only warn you of the promised punishment of which I have been informed by the inspired revelation. But those who counsel deaf are oblivious of Allah's warning). Their hearts' ears are closed to the cautionary advice
And if afflicted with a slight touch of your Creator's retributive punishment they -the infidels- shall say: "Woe betide us, we were indeed wrongful of actions
And We set the scales even in Day of Judgement admitting of no deviation and We judge with absolute justice and accordingly no soul shall ever be wronged in the least. Every deed, good or bad, will We present with precision even if it be as light or as little as a mustard seed. Enough are We in putting the law in execution
And We gave Mussa and Harun the canon imparting the soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends and in the choice of what is morally good, honest and straight-forward, serving as an illumination and enlightenment besides being a divine light and a constant reminder of Allah to those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Who stand in awe of Allah albeit they cannot apprehend Him by sight and think of the Day of Resurrection dreading the Final Hour of Judgement
And this -Quran- is a blessed Book We have revealed to guide into all truth; will you -infidels- reject and deny what is good and advantageous to attain and possess
Aforetime, We directed Ibrahim to reasoning and to employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions and We were fully aware of his thoughts and of his innermost being
He asked his father and his people: "what are these statues and images you regard with reverence and veneration
They said: "we found our fathers revering them and adoring them with appropriate acts and rites
But you and your fathers", said Ibrahim, "were erroneous indeed in your system of faith and worship
Have you brought us the truth," they asked, "or are you one of those who make this the object of a joke
But your Allah", said Ibrahim, is the Creator of the heavens and the earth Who generated them and brought them into existence and to this effect I sincerely bear witness
And, by Allah", said Ibrahim, "I will plot down your idols to dethrone them after you have gone and turned your backs
And so he reduced them -the idols- into a useless form except their biggest, so that they might turn to it for information
And when they returned, they exclaimed: "He who has done this to our gods is indeed wrongful of actions
Some of them said: "we heard a young man by the name of Ibrahim cursing them and calling them names
Bring him here before the people", they said, "so that they may witness with their own eyes the consequence, for he -Ibrahim- has much to answer for
And when he was brought over, they asked him: "Was it you Ibrahim who did this to our gods
But it was their chief who did it", Said Ibrahim; ask them if they are able to talk
And there, they blamed themselves saying: "You are indeed the wrongful of actions
But, overturned by imprudence in their minds and by subversion of reason, they said to him: "You knew very well that these idols do not talk
Do you worship besides Allah," ask Ibrahim, "objects neither profit you nor can do you harm
Fie on you and on those objects you worship besides Allah; can you not think in a sensible and logical manner and employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions
Nevertheless", they said, "burn him and uphold your gods if indeed you intend to maintain our system of faith and worship and sustain it against criticism
We said: "O fire! be cool and maintain your coolness and afford Ibrahim safety and security" and We graced him with peace of mind
So conditioned, they thought of contriving against him, but We made them the losers who lost the most
And We rescued him together with Lut (Lot). -his nephew- and delivered them to the land We had blessed -Aram or Syria and Can'an or Palestine- the land where many divine messages were revealed for all
And We bestowed on him Ishaq (Isaac) and in addition We graced him with Ya'cob (Jacob) -a grand son- each of whom We characterized by virtue and righteousness
And We made them leaders of faith guiding people into all truth as We willed and We inspired to them the deeds of wisdom and piety and the act of worship and alms giving. They were exclusively devoted to serving Our purpose and they worshipped Us alone
And to Lut, We imparted wisdom, sovereignty and divine knowledge and We rescued him and delivered him out of the town whose inhabitants established the most evil and abominable and abnormal sexual practice. They were perverse people given to shameful deeds and immorality
And We admitted him to the domain of Our mercy. He was one of those characterized by justice and uprightness and he was morally right
And Nuh (Noah) who invoked Us aforetime and We responded favourably to his invocation and rescued him and delivered him together with his family from the distressful and overwhelming inundation
And We rescued him from the people who rejected Our divine signs and denied Our Omnipotence and Authority; they were people who bode ill and were given to evil, and in consequence We drowned them all
And Dawud (David) and Sulayman (Solomon) who passed judgement -not inspired- upon the owners of the sheep which escaped from their cote and strayed in people field, and We were witnesses of their Judgement*. * David's decision centered on compensation
But We inspired Sulayman with the insight of the matter** -therefore, his inspired decision, in addition to being compensatory, was constructive and promotive of work and advancement- and to each one of them We imparted wisdom and correct judgement, knowledge and intellectual acquaintance with the truth. And We subdued the mountains as well as the birds to join David in praising Allah and in extolling His glorious attributes, and We have always been Omnipotent enough to accomplish what we will. **The prosecutor makes use of the sheep until the defender makes the necessary repairs and restores the field to the original state, then each takes back his property
And We taught Dawud the art of making coats of arms for people's protection to defend you from injury and to shield you from the violence exercised against each other. And now will you impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
And to Sulayman We subdued the wind raging and blowing tempestuously to flow at his command to the blessed land We had marked with grace -his influence extended over a vast territory, Palestine, Syria, Arabia, Ethiopia,- and We were 'Alimin (Omniscient)of all things and all affairs
Those among the Jinn characterized with satanic attributes were also subdued to him to dive into the waters -after the treasures-pearls, corals,- in addition to other jobs and We were watching over them -not to slow down nor escape
And Ayub (Job) who invoked Allah, his Creator, for relief. He said: "O Allah, my Creator, I have suffered long lasting tribulation and You are the Most Merciful of all who show mercy
And We responded favourably to his invocation and relieved him and freed it him from all tribulation and We compensated to him a progeny to replace those he had lost .We doubled their number (grand children), a mercy extended to him from Us and a great event to be happily remembered by those who are constant
Also Ismail, Idris -possibly Ozoris- and Zut-kifl -Dhoukefl-, possibly - Ezchiel each of whom faced hardship and tribulations with perseverance, patience and endurance
We admitted them in the domain of Our mercy, for they were of those characterized by justice and uprightness and were morally right
And Zun-nun -Yunus-, who met the opposition of the people to whom he was sent with impatience. Moved by anger he renounced them and left them thinking that We would not reprove him for such a behaviour. -He went on board ship and in the crossing it was decided by the crew that he was one too many and must be got rid of-. In the sea he was swallowed by the fish wherein he was constrained. In the depth of darkness he called on Allah and invoked His mercy, he said: "O Allah, there is no Ilah but You, glory be to You and extolled are Your glorious attributes. I have been rongful of actions
And there, We responded favourably to him and delivered him from the sorrow and the distress, for thus do We save those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues
And Zakariya -Zacharias- when he invoked Allah, his Creator, and said: "O Allah, my Creator, leave me not childless, a quality imparting the feeling of loneliness -a child not to inherit me but to pursue the same line of action so that Your word may have a free course-. When it comes to inheritance You are indeed the Only and the best heir Who shall inherit the whole and all in all
We responded to him favourably and bestowed on him Yahya ( John), having rendered his wife fruitful. These were people who hastened to doing all that is good, useful, reliable for a purpose, efficient in function and in pursuit of faith, and they invoked Us expressing their due affectionate devotion keeping in awe of Us and hopeful of Our mercy, and they humbled themselves before Us and were indeed submissive to Us alone
And Maryam (Mary) who guarded herself from being supposed and maintained the flower of faith and chastity, and so We sent to her Our Messenger -the Spirit Gabriel-, to breathe life into her and animate a soul in her womb, and We made her and her son Isa (Jesus) an emblem of Our Omnipotence and Authority to be pondered by all people
This is the religion eminently professed by all the previous Prophets, the one and only system of faith and worship established by Allah and I am Allah your Creator, therefore, worship Me and adore Me with the appropriate acts and rites
Yet people according to their desires and irreligious viewpoints set themselves at variance, but all shall inevitably return to Us
Therefore, he who imprints his deeds with wisdom and piety while his heart reflects the image of religious and spiritual virtues shall be the recipient of Our mercy; his deeds and his endeavour shall not be undermined nor denied and We record his endeavour to his advantage
It is not the end; the punishment We inflict on any town to reduce it to a useless form is certainly not the end nor does it mean that they will not rise again. They will rise, they have much to answer for and pay for their sinful deeds Hereafter
(And when the gates of evil are widely open) and Gog and Magog overflow from everywhere overcoming all barriers and ramparts
And the promised Event approaches, there and then shall the infidels' eyes be wide open gazing fixedly in horror and they express their thoughts in words, thus: "Woe betide us ", they shall say, "we were not only oblivious of this event but We were also wrongful of actions
And there, they are told: "You and those you worshipped besides Allah are the fuel of Hell to which you shall now proceed
Had these objects of worship you incorporated with Allah been gods who shared His divine nature they would not have companioned you therein. "And now all and each of you shall be imprisoned within its grim confines for that vast and endless forever
There within, shall they pant, emitting with difficulty a deep breath and drawing with more difficulty a long breath heaving sighs and giving sobs, and the painful emotion compounded of loathing and fear and the feeling excited by fright shall deafen their ears that they cannot hear
But those in whom Allah's grace has abounded beforehand are those who shall be kept far away from hence
They do not hear the sharp continual hissing sound its flames emit; to the contrary, they shall be swimming in the eternal ecstasy of joy of what their souls had always desired
Nor shall they be disturbed, grieved nor shocked by the overwhelming terror -of The Day of Judgement- and they shall be received with a hearty welcome by the angels who put their minds at rest and say to them: "this is the happy day you were promised
This is the Day when We fold the heavens the way the scribe rolls together the scrolls that are ready for the publishing of books, so that as We effected the first creation so will We effect recreation* a promise that We are Omnipotent enough to fulfill and bring to an end
And We decreed and reduced to writing in the AL-Zabur (Psalms) what is in harmony with the text in AL-Tawrah (Torah) that the earth shall be inherited by My devout worshippers who imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety and their hearts with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
This proclamation is made evident in this Book -the Quran- and stands as a declaration to people who adore Allah with the appropriate acts and rites
We did not send you O Muhammad for a reason other than to symbolize, and serve as an embodiment of mercy which Allah has extended to all His creatures
Therefore, say to the people: "it is a fact that I am being divinely inspired that your Allah is absolutely One Ilah; will you then conform your will to His will in Islam! to Him alone
And should they turn their backs, then say to them: "I have done my duty and I have proclaimed to you all alike the word of Allah and warned you of the consequences". "And I just do not know whether what you have been promised -good or bad- is close at hand or far and distant
He -Allah- knows what is avowed openly and the open course of action, and He knows what the breasts forge and what they store of thoughts and feelings and all that is suggested secretly to the mind. He .knows all that you do out of sight
Nor do I know the reason for the respite granted to you people, it may be a trial to test your true belief and inclination or to give you enough rope to allow you free scope of action up to a predetermined point of time in order that you may commit yourselves -or relent and be brought to your senses
And invoke Allah O Muhammad to give judgement upon your matter, thus: "Your Judgement O Allah, my Creator, is truth personified; judge O Allah, my Creator between me and those who rejected Your word". And say to them: "and Allah, AL- Rahman is He Whose present help is sought to endure with impunity the blashemies you utter against Him
O you people: Regard Allah, your Creator, with reverence and awe and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him. The quake of the universe at the Final flour in. Day of Judgement is indeed astounding. It excites intense horror
The Day you see it shall every nursing mother forget her suckling and every pregnant female -human and animal- shall miscarry what is conceived in her womb, and you see the people stunned and thrown into confusion while not intoxicated. But it is actually the reflection of Allah's wrath speaking thunder
Yet among the people is he who argues about Allah in ignorance and by want of thought and follows every disobedient devil and follows those with characteristics befitting AL-Shaytan (Satan) who is evil personified
He AL-Shaytan has been designated as evil itself and he who takes him as his tutelary friend or guardian shall be misled and be lost in the maze of error led by the nose to where he suffers the torment of the blazing fire laid upon the damned
O You people: if you are in doubt of Resurrection; nonetheless We raised you from dust, then We made you evolve from a seed* -a constituent part of emitted fluid- then from a clinging organism then from a bolus-like mass of coherent body of matter partly shaped and partly not yet shaped, to realize Allah's Omnipotence. And We embed in the wombs what we will for a determined period of time, We then disburden the wombs of you as a new born babe, then you grow to maturity. And among you is he who is caused to die and also he who is carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life that he loses the wits which were once about him and he loses remembrance of knowledge he formerly mastered; he becomes the abject heir of an illustrious name. And you see the earth lifeless and barren and when We send rain down upon and it is stirred to activity, it thrives and it is stirred to activity, flourishes and vegetates variegated vegetal growths of like things
This is by reason of Allah's attributes. He is Truth personified and He is it Who raises the dead and restores them to life and He is indeed Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things and to accomplish what He will
He authoritatively states that: The Final Hour (Day of Judgement) is an undoubted Event and an absolute certainty and that Allah shall resurrect those deposited in the graves
Yet among the people is he who argues about Allah in ignorance and by want of thought and guidance and by want of a Book imparting divine knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light
You see him- bending his side in disdain, and slipping aside from righteousness and piety in order to mislead the people from the path of Allah. He shall suffer shame, dishonour and disgrace and We will make him taste the blazes Hereafter
This is in consequence", he is told, "of what your wrongful and unclean hands have committed, and Allah is not He Who does not observe the principles of justice when He judges His servants whether they are bad or angels
And among people are some who serve Allah conditionally, standing on the brink or border, as it were, between faith without and infidelity within. If all goes well with any of them and he makes worldly gains he is gratified and he advances without and to his heart's content. And should he be tested for true belief and inclination and he is consequently befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity he retracts and retreats within, he tumbles down on his face and turns renegade wherefore he loses both worlds, here and Hereafter, And this is indeed the utmost loss
He erroneously invokes besides Allah objects unable to harm him nor profit him and this is perversion in the extreme
He invokes an object which would sooner hurt him than profit him. How bad is the tutelary guardian and how bad is the society
Allah does indeed welcome those whose hearts are imprinted with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety. He mercifully admits them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow and Allah does what He will
He who feels that Allah shall not afford His Prophet help here nor Hereafter, may attach a rope to the ceiling or stretch a rope heavenward to hang himself and cuts off his own breath or tries to stop the Prophet's help from heaven and sees whether such a plan or a scheme shall annul his rage
Thus did We reveal it -the Quran- embodying clear and plain revelations guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment; Allah does indeed guide whom He will
Those who have acknowledged the Prophet Muhammad and those disposed to believe in the Prophets of the past and those who profess Judaism and the Christians and the various sects of the Sabeites or Mendaites and of the Sabians as well as the Majiis (Magians, lived in Persia, Median & Mesopotamia, worshipped fire as a fit emblem of Allah) and those who incorporated with Allah other deities, shall all have much to answer for. Allah shall judge between them in Day of Judgement; He is the Omnipresent Who witnesses all actions and all things
Do you not see O you who are oblivious of Allah's Omnipotence that to Allah do all creatures in the heavens and on earth prostrate in adoration, praise and worship, and so do the sun and the moon, the stars and the mountains, the trees and the animals and a great many among mankind! Moreover, a great many have deserved punishment. And he whom Allah defames or treats with contempt shall no one be able to restore his honour. Allah does what He will
There, you people have an intellectual acquirement to comprehend: two opponents who argued, one in favour and the other against Allah, their Creator. As for those invested with the ugly vesture of disbelief, their measures have been taken for fitting them with an exclusive attire; vesture made of fire, and on their heads, the seat of thought and imagination will be poured hot water bubbling over in agitation
Boiling water- diffusing itself throughout to melt what is in their bellies and liquefy their skins
They will be restricted in solitary confinement within cells ribbed and vaulted with iron
As often as they seek relief they try to get out from thence, only to be returned back therein and be told: "Taste the torture of burning in the fire
Allah receives with hearty welcome those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand and whose deeds reflected wisdom and piety. He admits them to Gardens beneath which rivers flow where they shall be adorned with golden and pearled-bracelets and vested in silken attire
They were instinctively guided to use gracious words in their discourse and they were graced with Allah's guidance to His path, the path of AL-Aziz (the Almighty) to whom are extolled the glorious attributes
Indeed, those infidels who rejected Allah and stood in the way to prevent His spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth, malevolently obstructing the way to the Sacrosanct House shall have much to answer for We made it a refuge at the disposal of all men alike, retreating therein and exercising religious devotion as well as to the strangers. He among them whose intention is irreverence and profanity, blasphemy and wrong-doing will have come within the measure of Allah's wrath. We will make him taste the torment laid upon the damned
We had indicated to Ibrahim (Abraham) the site where he would build the Sacrosanct House and We instructed him thus: "Do not incorporate with Me other deities", "and cleanse My House from moral and spiritual defilements -idols and the like, placed by the Pagans- and impart to it real sacredness, and make it ceremonially clean for those who go round it in procession and for those who perform the act of worship standing and for those who kneel in supplication and prostrate to make an act of the mind and the will in acknowledgement of Allah's Omnipotence, Perfection and Authority prostrating their reason to divine revelation
And proclaim pilgrimage to the people; they shall come to you on foot and mounted upon the back of every lean and exhausted beast of burden from every deep, distant and far away places
They shall be eager to respond to your call to observe facts and events considered a source of knowledge, and to participate in the intercourse of life and envisage the spiritual and the deeply moving sacred events and associations dating back as the most ancient times." "And they will extoll and proclaim the glorious attributes of Allah throughout the predetermined days in appreciation of Allah's blessings, and be impelled to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness for what He provided for them of cattle for sacrifice, and to fulfill what He has enjoined" Thus: "Eat there from if you may and feed the indigent and the needy who are in need of Zakat (alms), " for zakat is but the vehicle of prayer
Thereafter they shall be permitted to remove the unwanted biological accumulations on their bodies -hair, dirt, nails, and to fulfill their promises and pay their vows -if any- and again go round the ancient Sacrosanct House in procession
So be it, and he who honours what Allah has ordained to be observed will have accomplished what is laudable and acceptable to Him And in that connection, the flesh of cattle has been rendered lawful to you -camels, cows, sheep and the like animals reared for food- except those designated to you as forbidden. And avoid sacrificing animals under the immolation to idols. They are an abomination, and avoid telling a falsehood as well as the intentional assertion of what is false
Sincerely maintaining the precepts of Allah's system of faith and worship authoritatively established by Him and not incorporating with Him other deities. And he who incorporates with Him other deities shall stand similitude exact of someone who has fallen from heaven and been snatched by the birds of prey -which make a rapid sweeping descent upon its prey- or been swept away by a storm in its fury to a distant and far off place
So be it, and he who honours Allah's sacred acts and rites and turns his thoughts upon the duties owed to Him will have won Allah's affection; for honouring Allah's rites is an endearment of the hearts reflective of piety
You advantage yourselves of them up to a determined point of time then they are taken to where they belong, the Ancient Sacrosanct House, where they are sacrificed and pilgrimage will have had all its rites
And to every people did We authoritatively determine certain rites -of sacrifice- that they may use the sacred event to commemorate Allah's Name and perform the sacrifice under the immolation of His Name as a form of warm feeling of good will and gratitude for what He has provided for them of live stock reared for food. For indeed, your Allah is One and only. Therefore, conform your will to His will -in Islam-. Meanwhile, announce O Muhammad joyful tidings to those
Who lift to Allah their inward sight while their innermost being is actuated with the feeling of dread mingled with veneration at the mention and the thought of Him
And the camels and cows did We make lawful for you to use in the event of your oblation of thanks giving and in your offering. They serve as a store from which you obtain advantages in plenty. Therefore, pronounce Allah's Name on them as they are lined up, slaughtered and laid on their sides. You may eat therefrom and feed him who is content and satisfied in mind despite poverty, as well as him who is needy and circumstances compel him to beg. Thus did We make them -these animals- subservient for you that you may hopefully impel yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
It is not their flesh nor their blood that reaches Allah. It is only the piety on your part, the obedience and the faithfulness to the duties owed to Him. We made them subservient to you so that you may praise Allah and extoll His glorious attributes in return for His guidance to you into all truth. Meanwhile proclaim O Muhammad joyful tidings to those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
Indeed, Allah defends those whose hearts are imprinted with the image of religious and spiritual virtues whereas He simply detests the dishonest, the unfaithful and the treacherous given to infidelity and ingratitude
Those who have been attacked by the infidels who waged war against them for their belief in Allah are permitted to fight in defense of the wrong inflicted on them; Allah is indeed Qadirun (Omnipotent) enough to afford them help
They -the Muslims- were unjustly ousted from their homes for no reason other than expressing their thoughts in words, thus: "Our Allah is the Creator of the whole and of all in all". And were it not that Allah represses some people by others, monasteries, churches, synagogues oratories and mosques, where He is much remembered and His glorious attributes extolled would have been demolished and reduced to a useless form. But Allah does indeed help those whose purpose is to serve Him and advance His cause; Allah is indeed Qadirun and Azizun (Almighty)
These are they who lift to Allah their inward sight and will not neglect religious observances (the act of worship, zakat (almsgiving) enjoining what is just and right and forbidding what is evil) when given power and authority in the land. The ultimate decision of all affairs rests in the hands of Allah, - here and Hereafter
Should they -the infidels- accuse you O Muhammad of falsehood, so did those before them, the people of Noah, of 'Ad -the 'Adites- and of Thamud -the Thamudites-; they charged their Prophets with imposturous pretence
So did the people of Ibrahim and those of Lut (Lot)
And those of Madyan and those of as Mussa (Moses). In consequence I granted them respite up to a predetermined point of time, then I cast them down from a position of prosperity and power and brought them to ruin, and how unbearable was the change of disposition and how intolerable was the fitting retribution
Wherefore many were the towns We destroyed with their wrongful inhabitants that they stood desolate and empty but of dilapidated trellises over hills of ruin, and the wells and the spacious and the highly decorated buildings neglected, empty and abandoned
Have they -these infidels- not journeyed through the land and employed the faculty of reason in forming conclusions and looked with their minds' eyes to realize as much as their hearts may comprehend and their ears may hear! Indeed, it is not the eyes of the body that go blind but it is the eyes of the hearts in the breasts and those of the mind
And they -the infidels- ask you O Muhammad to hasten on the promised retributive punishment. But never shall Allah break His promise nor go back on His word. And a day in your Creator's calendar is as a thousand years of your earthly calendar
And how many towns of wrongful inhabitants did I grant respite then I cast them down from a position of prosperity and power and brought them to ruin and to Me shall in the end be the destination
Say to the people: "O you people, I have been sent to you all as a spectacle and an evident warning
Consequently, those who acknowledge Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety shall be mercifully forgiven and be graced with blessed provision
Whereas those who strive to oppose and invalidate Our authoritative and divine signs shall be the inmates of Hell
Nor did We send before you O Muhammad a Messenger or a Prophet but was opposed by those with characteristics befitting AL-Shaytan. They were determined to suppress their volition and intervene between them and their divine cause and to influence the peoples' minds with their satanic wickedness. But there and then does Allah annul the satanic desire and render it void and He confirms His spirit of truth guiding into all truth and strengthening His cause. Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun. (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
Allah plans it in this manner in order to use the incitement instigated by the satanic as a trial for those whose hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their inmost being and in whose hearts reigns cruelty. And the wrongful of actions are in disagreement producing extreme contention and discord
And those whose hearts are a storehouse of information and imparted knowledge rest assured that this Quran is the truth from Allah, your Creator, and in consequence accept it believe in it and humbly open their hearts' ears thereto. And Allah guides those who acknowledge Him to the path of righteousness
Nevertheless, the infidels continue to be in doubt of the divine nature of it -the Quran- and will remain undecided until the sudden encounter with death taking them by surprise planting their great Hereafter in the now or until they face the disastrous Day of Judgement which is barren of their expectations and their hopes are doomed to disappointment
There and then shall the Sovereign Authority and the right of controlling be exclusively that of Allah Who sits in judgement to confer the beatitude and the gardens of bliss on those whose hearts were imprinted with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety
And to requite the infidels who defiantly rejected Allah's divine and authoritative signs with the torment that is laid upon the damned
And those who quit their homes and their towns to settle where they could best serve Allah's purpose and strive in His cause whether killed in action or died of natural causes shall be honoured. Allah shall make His grace abound in them, for He is indeed the best Purveyor of all the material necessities and of all the spiritual attributes
He shall admit them into favour and grant them an honourable entry actuating them with the feeling of pleasure and satisfaction; Allah is indeed 'Alimun and Halimun (Forbearing) toward His creatures
And he who makes requital or retaliation on a person for an injury he has received shall -if he must- repay only in kind and in extent. Should he -the plaintiff- be offended further by the offender, then shall Allah help him -the former- against the aggressor -the latter- and give him victory over him; Allah is indeed ever 'Afuwun (Indulgent), and Ghafurun (Forgiving)
This is it, for Allah Who causes the night to lose its character and identity by absorption into the day and causes the day to lose its character and identity by absorption into the night is indeed able to keep His promise and His support to whom He will. And Allah is indeed Sami'un (Ominipresent) with unlimited audition and Bassirun (He clearly sees all things)
Wherefore Allah is truth personified and any other object of worship they invoke besides Him is simply falsehood itself. Allah is indeed the Unique Whose attributes belong to the highest regions of thought and reality, the Unique Who is eminently entitled to the designation: "The Supreme
Do you not see that Allah sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water and makes it instrumental in springing up vegetation and rendering the land verdant! Allah is indeed Latifun (Gracious). He gives His servants an understanding heart. He is Khabirun (Omniscient)
To Him belong all that is in the heavens arid all that is on earth and Allah is indeed Ghaniyun (Independent), (Absolute) and Hamidun (His grace abounds in the universe, and he is worthy of all praise)
Do you not see that Allah reduced for you al! that is on earth to a state of subservienacy, and the ships move on the surface of the sea by His invisible acting force producing their buoyance and their motion ! And tIe sustains and support the heavens -their contents- and keeps them from falling on the earth unless it be permitted by Him -meteorites, shooting stars, fire balls-. Indeed, Allah displays kindness to all people, -those who serve Him and those who do not. His mercy is extended to all
And He is it Who brought you into existence and gave you life. Then He occasions your death and at the predetermined point of time your Resurrection. Man is indeed ungrateful
To every people did We prescribe certain rites and articles of faith and the order of performing religious and other devotional services, and it was incumbent on them to follow (until the system was modified or replaced by a new system suitable for the time at the hands of another Messenger) Therefore, do not let them O Muhammad dispute with you upon the question, and keep proclaiming Allah's acceptable system of faith and worship. You are indeed on the right path, the path of righteousness, the path of Allah
And should they -the infidels- be tossed in their unballasted wits in fathomless and unquiet deeps of controversy, then say to them: "Allah knows best what you do
Allah shall judge between you in Day of Judgement in all matters for which you are ready to contend to your life's end
Do you not know that Allah is 'Alimun of all that is in heaven and on earth. It is all on record and this is quite easy for Him to do
Yet they worship besides Allah objects He has never authorized and of which they have empty knowledge. And the wrongful of actions shall have no one to afford them help at the moment when they need it most
And -to their misfortune- when Our revelations are recited to them and Our divine signs are presented, you instantly notice that their countenance speak a different language reflecting hatred, denial and disdain. They are almost ready to set upon with hostile action and words to injure and overthrow those who recite to them Our revelations, Say to them O Muhammad: -If these divine revelations are distasteful to you- shall I tell you of what shall be far worse and more distasteful to you ! it is Hell which Allah has promised to those infidels who denied Him, and how evil is the end for which they are destined
O you people: An allegorical representation is introduced to describe a subject under the guise of some other subject of aptly suggestive resemblance intended to convey a useful lesson by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth. Thus: those whom you invoke besides Allah, idols or human, shall not be able to create a fly even if they get together and combine their efforts. And if a fly should ravish anything out of their hands or out of their environ never shall they be able to reclaim it. How helpless is the suppliant - who is defeated by a fly- and the creature entreated -the fly
They -the Meccan infidels- did not credit Allah with the attributes asserted as His own. Indeed, Allah is Qawiyun (Omnipotent) and Azizun, The Almighty Who prevails against the whole and all in all
Allah chooses from the angels Messengers as He chooses from mankind He is indeed Sami'un and Bassirun
He knows His creatures' current events and the course of their coming events bridging their span, and to Him, the Ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution -here and Hereafter
O you people whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand, go down on your knees and bow to the ground in reverence and submission to Allah and prostrate your reason to divine revelation and worship Allah, your Creator, and lift to Him your inward sight and imprint your deeds with wisdom and piety so that heaven may prosper you
And strive in the cause of Allah and make His purpose the heart of your purpose. He did not intend to put you in difficulty nor to create for you difficultness in the system of faith and worship He has chosen for you, the same system followed by your father Ibrahim . It is He -Allah- Who gave you people the descriptive and distinctive appellation "Muslims " in previous Scriptures as well as in this Book - the Quran - so that the Messenger Muhammad would be a witness of your actions and you come to be witnesses of peoples' actions which interpret their thoughts and characterize their rival systems. Therefore, engage in the act of worship, give alms and turn your minds to Allah and see that you be under His tutelage. He is your Tutelary Guardian ,and how ultimate in excellence is the Protector and the Ultimate of Ultimates to afford help
Successful has been the outcome achieved by those in whose hearts reign piety
who habitually exercise humility and low estimate of themselves when standing before Allah in spiritual union and devotion
Who refrain from small or idle talk, gossip and slander
Who perform the religious duty of giving Zakat (alms) with the sympathetic feeling toward the poor and their due
Who guard their sexual morality and refrain from unlawful sexual congress sex perversion and sex abuse
But absolved are they to satisfy their instinctive sexual desire with those to whom they are matrimonially united or with those whom they choose to marry from those on hand -and there they incur no blame
And those who do not confine their sexual activity within these limitations will have violated and disregarded the set limits instituted by Allah
Who are trustworthy, an attribute including
And those who faithfully observe their act of worship and all it entails
Such persons are the inheritors of Allah's mercy and blessings here and Hereafter
They shall inherit Paradise -the garden of Eden- where they enjoy the surpassing beauty and supreme bliss and Wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity
In point of fact We brought man to being by special creation from a line of wet and soft earth matter
Then We made him evolve from a Notfa Amshag (union of male & female seeds) the Zygot which We embedded in the depth of a safe and secure position, the womb
Then We made the Notfa develop into a clinging organism*, Then We made the clinging organism develop into a bolus** -like mass of coherent body of matter. Then We made the bolus- like mass develop into bones and We clothed the bones with flesh. Out of this We raised a different being. Glorified be Allah and extolled be His glorious attributes; He is the Unique Creator
Thereafter, shall all of you come upon the encounter with death -and be deposited in the graves
And at the predetermined point of time set for the Day of Judgement shall all of you be resurrected and restored to life
And We created seven heavens that hang high above your heads and We are not oblivious of Our creation -it is We Who maintain them in existence and in order, not to mention precision
And We sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water in due measure and We settled it on the planet earth partly without and partly within - enough to effect the necessary equilibrium, between the opposing forces of land and water, between cloud formation and fresh water in rivers and lakes maintaining life, between the clouds and the water deposited underground- and We are certainly able to make it vanish
We made it instrumental in springing up for you gardens and orchards of date-palms and vines supplying you with abundance of fruits affording you delight
in addition to the tree (olive tree) springing out of Mount Sinai producing oil and nutrition -best unsaturated fats, protein, calcium salts, iron, Phosphorus, vitamin A and B - for those who eat therefrom
And you have in cattle a divine sign emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, a sign for you to ponder. From their bellies We supply you with a pure drink -milk- and other great benefits you advantage yourselves thereof
And on their backs and on board ships you are carried -from one place to another
Yet people have always been averse to Allah's divine message, past and present and this is exampled in Noah's people and in those who followed - We sent NUh (Noah) with Our divine message to his people. He said to there " My people, I advise you to acknowledge Allah and to worship Him with appropriate acts and rites. You have no Ilah but Him. Will you entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
But the leaders of infidelity among his people exclaimed: "He is only a human like yourselves" They added "he simply wishes to take precedence of you and to claim supereminence for holiness and high virtues". "And had Allah willed", they added, "He would have sent down angels to serve as His Messengers." "We never heard of such a notion voiced by our ancestors
Indeed", they continued, "he is but a man ruinously imprudent, possessed or insane. Watch him for sometime with patience, his madness may subside or else he would deserve destruction
There, did NUh invoke Allah for His aid: "O Allah, my Creator", he prayed, "give me victory over them, they have accused me of falsehood
There and then, We inspired him. " Construct the Ark, " We said, "under Our supervision and according to Our inspired divine instructions. "And when Our command comes to pass and you see the water bubbling up and rising in billows and erupting through the earth's surface inundating the land, you just carry with you on board ship a pair-a male and a female- of every kind (or possibly two pairs of every species of the living creatures) together with your family except those against whom Allah has already pledged His word." "And do not talk to Me O NUh about those wrongful of actions nor plead on their behalf They shall most certainly be drowned
And when you and those in your company have embarked, you express your gratitude to Allah in words, thus:" "Our bosoms surge forth and answer thanks to Allah Who has saved us and delivered us from those wrongful of actions
And pray: "O Allah, my Creator, help me disembark compassed about by Your blessing and let the place where I make abode be a place of security, consolation and solace. You are the Ultimate Who can accommodate whom You will to the best
These are tokens signalizing Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and We have always been testing people for their true belief and inclination
Thereafter, We brought about another generation, the Adites
And We sent to them a Messenger whom We chose from among them to convey to them Our divine message. He said to them: "Worship Allah with appropriate acts and rites, you have no Ilah other than Him. Will you not then entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
The leaders among his people who denied Allah and rejected the idea of having audience of Him in Day of Judgement said: " But he is only a human like yourselves. He eats the same food you eat and drinks of what you drink." thereby denying what We bestowed on them of what ministered to their enjoyment and content in life
And", they added, "should you follow a man like yourselves your hopes shall be doomed to disappointment and you will he great losers
Does he promise you", they said, "that after you have died and been reduced to dust and degenerate bones, you will be resurrected and restored to life
How inconceivable and how far from the truth is that you are promised
In fact", they said, "there is only this present life. We die and as the grass upon the earth shall our posterity be, they shall also die and their posterity shall live until time does away with life and reduces this world to a useless form, and all time shall appear but short time but indeed as no time and never shall we be resurrected
He is simply a man," they continued, "who cheaply and viciously relates to Allah falsehood, and never shall we acknowledge him nor recognize his mission
And there, he prayed: "O Allah, my Creator, give me victory over them; they have accused me of falsehood
Rest assured," said Allah to His Messenger, " their defiance and their pride are short-lived and soon enough shall they be really sorry and shall weep a rain of sorrows
And there, in due time were they justly overtaken by a direful cry from heaven's realm stirring up a merciless blast reducing them to an assemblage of scum, and so away with the wrongful of actions
And We raised after them other generations
No people or nation can predate their set period of time nor can they postdate it either -includes: span of prosperity, of misery, of other conditions as well as that of life
Thereafter, We sent Messengers, one succeeding another, and as often as a Messenger presented himself to his people he was accused of falsehood. In consequence, We punished them successively following One upon another and We made them the talk of all towns; Away with people who just refuse to acknowledge Allah
Then We sent Mussa and his brother Harun (Aaron) well equipped with divine signs serving to demonstrate delegated divine power and Authority
We sent them to Pharaoh and the chief peers of his realm, but they did not answer their hopes and they prided themselves on their arrogance and non - courteous refusal, and displayed inordinate self- esteem and undue assumption of dignity
And they said to them: "Shall we submit to two men like ourselves while their people are reduced by us to a servile state
And they accused them of falsehood, and in consequence were they added to the list of those who perished
And We gave Mussa the Book of truth AL-Tawrah -the Torah- so that his people -the Israelites- may hopefully be guided into all truth
And We made the son of Maryam (Mary) – Isa (Jesus)- and his mother an emblem of Our Omnipotence and Authority and We provided them with a shelter on a high land affording them security and peace of mind, and beneath which flowed a spring
We said to each and all Our Messengers- "O you Messengers:" exhort your people to: eat of all that has been rendered lawful and all that is worthy, good and wholesome and imprint your deeds with wisdom and piety, for I am 'AlimUn (Omniscient) of all that you do
All of you are but one people and you constitute one nation. Allah's message is one. His system of faith and worship is one and I am Allah, your Creator, therefore, I exact from you obedience and that you entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Me
Yet they -the people- were divided among themselves and set at variance and the ties among them were severed. Instead of unity in feeling, action and purpose, they set their actual sectarian practice, each rejoicing with his own views
Therefore, leave them O Muhammad for the time swimming in the depth of error and ignorance which have reached up unto heaven, there is a fitting point of time for every event
Do they -the infidels- think that because We bestow on them wealth and progeny
We are pleased with their perverted adoration and by consequence hasten on to make all Our grace deservedly abound in them! To the contrary We give them enough rope to allow them free scope of action to commit themselves, but they do not have enough insight to look beneath the surface nor do they apprehend such matters with their senses
Conversely, those
Who sincerely acknowledge their Creator's revelations and His authoritative divine signs
Who do not incorporate with Allah, their Creator, other deities
Who give in benevolence, no matter what, lifting to Allah their inward sight and laying to their hearts their fate in Day of Judgement, an event they realize however unseen and approximate however remote
These are they who do strive to imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety and hasten to do more and hasten to gain more of Allah's mercy and blessings
And on no soul do We impose what is beyond its capability nor more than it can bear, and We have a volume in which all records of deeds and actions are kept and it simply speaks like a book and no one shall ever be wronged
But they -the infidels- are oblivious of all this and their hearts are sunk under the vexations of their minds, and besides that they engage themselves in work of irreverence and of evil that is wrought by want of thought
And when We lay hold upon the affluent among them who live in lust and wed them to calamities they groan out their souls and invoke Allah for relief
Do not ask for help now -here- or relief -Hereafter- for no help nor relief, shall you expect from Us ever
My revelations were recited to you throughout and My evident signs were presented to you, but you always shunned the truth and turned the other way
Ostentatiously exhibiting pride and inordinate self-esteem, making jokes and making it -the Quran- the object of your jokes rendering it as something ridiculous that should be disregarded and neglected
Do they -these infidels- not pause to think and employ the faculty of reason and reflect upon the discourse reaching their ears to realize that it is the truth personified! or have they received a message unheard of nor was it conveyed to their forefathers
Or do they not` recognize their Messenger Muhammad who is one of them and therefore do not avow him as one of their own
Or do they accuse him of being possessed, ruinously imprudent or insane! Indeed, he is a person steadfast in adherence to His Creator and His cause and he brought them -these Pagans- the very truth guiding into all truth, but how hateful to most of them is the truth
Indeed, if the truth were to accord with their desires, the heavens and the earth and all created beings, the animate and the inanimate therein would have gone to the bad and broken into corruption and fallen into disorder. But We have sent them the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and refers them directly to Allah. Yet they evade the troth. They are averse to admitting the truth and they shy off all that puts them in mind of the duties owed to Allah
Or do you ask them O Muhammad to pay you for the divine service you render! Never! and they do know that. And they had better realize that the reward granted by Allah, your Creator, far excels what is given by all others, for He is the best Purveyor Who makes provision for the needs of all
Besides, you are indeed the best guide who does lead them to righteousness, the path of Allah
But those who deny Resurrection and Judgement Hereafter never deviate into sense. On the contrary, they deviate themselves from the path of righteousness
And if We had extended to them Our mercy and blessings and delivered them from what was burdensome and exhaustive to their minds they would have sunk under the vexations of their minds, plunged into the abyss of wickedness and carried their transgression to excess
In fact, We formerly inflicted them with punishment and penalized them for disobedience and transgression that they may hopefully repent. But they never submitted nor humbled themselves to Allah, their Creator, nor did they entreat Him for mercy nor did they entreat of Him what He would have mercifully given
They persisted in wrong -doing until We closed the gate of mercy in their faces and opened the gate of torture and put them to torment (that they may be brought back to their senses) But to the contrary. they only nursed despair which led to recklessness and to heedlessness arising from despair
But Allah is He Who blessed you, people with the faculties of hearing and sight -faculties divine- and He implanted in you the seat of feeling, understanding and thought. Yet how little you render thanks or express gratitude in acknowledgement of His favours
And He is it Who established you on earth and made you increase in number by natural generation and in the end shall all of you be thronged before Him
And it is He who gives life and causes animate existence and it is He Who occasions the moment of death and deprives of animate existence. And to Him is related the natural phenomenon of the variations in duration and the constant alternation and succession symbolic of the night and the day and their contingent physical phenomena. Will you not therefore think in a sensible manner and employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions
No. they express their thoughts in words identical with those uttered by their ancestors
They say: "is it at all conceivable that when we die and be reduced to dust and bones we could be resurrected and restored to life
We had been promised that before," they add, "and so had been our fathers. We think this is nothing but fables of old
Ask them O Muhammad: "To whom belong the earth and all the animate and the inanimate created beings thereon! Tell me if you know
Ironically, they will say: "To Allah", then say to them: "Can you then not reflect
Ask them: "Who is the Ilah and Creator of the seven heavens and the Sovereign Who occupies the Supreme Throne
Again they will say: "Allah", then say to them; "Will you not then entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Ask them: "Who is He Who has the griping hands of the law of nature and the controlling power over the universe and protects the whole and all in all but needs no protection!" Tell me if you know
Again they will say: "Allah," then say to them: " then how can you be befooled so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true
But We have constantly presented to them the truth at the hands of all the Messengers but they persistently counterchange the truth with falsehood and lie in their teeth
Never did Allah take, adopt or beget a son nor did He share His sovereignty with any god; for, if He did, then each Allah would have had a kingdom of his own independent of the others and each would have established his own laws and made sure to exalt himself above the others. Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely far beyond all that they falsely attribute to Him
The Omniscient of all the unseen, the hidden and the unknown and the Omniscient of all that is perceived by sight and all that is evidently known, Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely far beyond all those whom they incorporate with Him
And pray: "O Allah, my Creator, if You have destined me to see in my life time the scene of the devastating retributive punishment which they have been promised
Then, I pray and beseech You O Allah, my Creator, not to make me a constituent part of the whole who are wrongful of actions
However, We are certainly able to let you see with your own eyes O Muhammad the scene of the promised devastating retributive punishment
Repress your offended and wounded feelings and repel evil with what is gracious in words or in action
And pray: "To You O Allah, my Creator, do I commit myself counter to the satanic instigations suggested to the mind
And to You O Allah, nay Creator, do I commit myself counter to their presence near me
And when any of them -these infidels- who have been promoting falsehood comes upon the encounter with death, he prays and beseeches Allah, his Creator to have him sent back to life
He says: "If given the chance" I may be able to do all I have neglected and left undone and imprint my deeds with wisdom and piety. Never. But this is a wish he expresses in words! Once the souls have been disembodied and crossed to the other world, it is then a one - way journey with no return. Behind them there is an impassable barrier barricading the passage back until the Day of Resurrection when people are then restored to life
And when the trumpet is sounded in Day of Judgement no ties of kinship of any kind or degree shall be of avail in accomplishing a purpose. Ties are simply dissolved and each one is tried upon no other recommendation than the quality of his own deeds nor shall they be able to discourse on any point
There and then, he whose deeds of wisdom and piety surpass in weight shall he and such persons be the fortunate who shall rejoice beyond a common joy
And he whose inequities surpass in weight on one scale of the balance shall he and such persons be losers. Their iniquities and unjust treatment of Our revelations and signs have lost them their souls
Their faces shall be scorched with the Fire and their countenances shall be expressive of pain and torture and their souls shall be bewailing their misfortune, their suffering and their ill - fate and bewailing at the day that they were born
And there, they will be told: "Were not My revelations recited to you throughout and My evident signs presented to you! and did you not always treat them as false statements made with the intent to deceive
And there, shall they say: "O Allah, our Creator, our pride and misgivings got the better of our prudence and we were certainly lost in the maze of error
O Allah, our Creator", they shall add, "deliver us out of it- of Hell. We will conform to Your system of faith and worship and if we should turn renegades then We will be wrongful of actions
Sink to the bottom of it" they will be told, "with hardship and torture and be buried into oblivion and do not talk to Me
When some of My servants prayed for mercy and forgiveness and prayed: "O Allah, our Creator, we have acknowledged Your divine nature and conformed to Your system of faith and worship, forgive us and have mercy on us. you are the Most Merciful of all who can extend mercy
You just made them the object of a joke and turned their prayer into ridicule that you forgot all about My message and you laughed them to scorn
But as you can see I have rewarded them this Day for their patience and forbearance under provocation of any kind, for bearing with others their faults and limitations and for their constancy in labour, exertion and effort. They are the winners of victory
How long", says Allah, "do you think you sojourned on earth year in and year out
A day or a part of a day", they say "but You may ask those -the angels- who keep count
You only sojourned for a short while if you had only known
Did you honesty think that We created you and brought you in the world below purposelessly or just for fun and that you would not be brought back to Us when there is much to answer for
Exalted be Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes, the Supreme Sovereign, the Truth personified; there is no Ilah but He, The Sovereign Who occupies the Most Honourable and Supreme Throne
And he who invokes, or incorporates with Allah, another llah without presenting evidence convincing the mind shall have much to answer for. This is in reply to the charges put against him by Allah, his Creator, in Day of Judgement. Never shall the infidels who deny Allah and His statutes find an instance of physical or spiritual prosperity Hereafter
And so, pray to Allah invoking Him for mercy, expressing your thoughts in words, thus: "O Allah, my Creator, You ascribed mercy and forgiveness, forbearance and indulgence unto Yourself. Forgive me and have mercy on me and on those whom You will; You are indeed the Most Merciful Whose mercy is extended to the wide circle of the all
This is a Surah We have revealed enjoining certain specific precepts in which Allah authoritatively binds people by a moral tie and a religious rite, A Surah in which divine representations of enlightenment, wisdom and spiritual light are intended to influence peoples' minds and actions that they may hopefully keep Allah in mind and lift to Him their inward sight
The woman and the man stained by adultery -in conduct- must be flogged. You flog them with repeated blows one hundred times and do not be moved with compassion on them, expressed in mercy, or else you will have failed to fulfill the duty ordained by Allah if indeed you believe in Allah and acknowledge His system of faith and worship and confess the Hereafter. And it is mandatory that their punishment be witnessed by an assemblage of those in whose hearts reigns piety
The man stained by adultery -in conduct- does not approach or cohabit but with a woman similarly stained or an idolatress. And the woman stained by adultery -in conduct- does not approach or cohabit but with a man similarly stained or an idolater, This defiled union is absolutely forbidden unto the believers in whose hearts reigns piety
And those who bring ill-fame upon virtuous women and do not support their accusation by four witnesses are offenders who must suffer for their offense. You flog them with the lash eighty strokes and deny them attestation in support of any matter whatsoever and forever, for such persons are indeed immoral and truly wicked
Exempt from this condemnation are those who in lowliest plight repentant stood and imprinted their deeds with wisdom and piety. They shall find Allah Ghafurun (Forgiving), Rahimun (Merciful) indeed
And when those who accuse their wives of adultery have no witnesses but themselves, then the evidence given by any of them alone shall be accepted if he binds himself by an oath solemnly declared four times in attestation of the truth of his statement
Then the fifth object to which he is sworn is that of an invocatory prayer inviting Allah's curse upon himself if he were lying
And the expedient which would avert her -the wife's- punishment is that she binds herself by an oath solemnly declared four times in attestation of the falsity of his - her husband's - statement
And the fifth object to which she is sworn is that of an invocatory prayer inviting the wrath of Allah upon herself if he were telling the truth
And had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you he would not have granted people respite... But Allah is Tawabun (accepts repentance and the atonement made by the people). And Hakimun (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
Indeed, those who have invented the lie -to defame the virtuous woman- are a group of people among you. Do not consider the incident a misfortune that has befallen you, on the contrary, it is to your advantage that it came out to light instead of being whispered about with bated breath. Every one of those involved in discrediting the faith shall be requited with what is commensurate with his share in the falsified incident. As to him whose spirit has moved him to lead the imprudent move* he shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned
If only the Muslims -men and women- as they heard the rumour realized, as they should have, that they are people of mind and reasoned high of Providence and of those who conformed to His will and thought of themselves as the model of chastity, and rejected the charge as falsehood personified
If only they -who laid the charge- supported their claim by four witnesses! And should they fail to accord with Allah's precepts and bind themselves by Allah's religious rite, then these are they whom Allah condemns in as much as they are worth and pronounces them wicked liars
And had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you here and Hereafter, you would have been afflicted with the torment laid upon the damned for plunging into this affair
You simply give it a speaking tongue and you give utterance to words describing your thoughts of a subject you have but empty knowledge of and you treat it as a trivial or a light matter of no consequence when in fact it is considered by Allah of a grievous consequence
If only when you Muslims heard the news you exclaimed: "Allah forbid, we must not give this subject a speaking tongue. Glory be to You O Allah and extolled are Your glorious attributes; this is indeed falsehood personified
Allah exhorts you not to reiterate such vile conduct ever if indeed you believe in Him with hearts imprinted with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Allah renders His revelations explicit that they impart to you divine knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light, and He is 'Alimun (Omniscient), and Hakimun (The Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
Indeed, those ill-tongued who just love to circulate and spread an injurious report to throw scandal on people-guilty or not guilty in the wide circle of the all as well as among those who conformed to Islam shall suffer heavily for it here and Hereafter. Allah is 'Alimun whereas you are not
And had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you and that He displays a kind disposition and mercy to those who serve Him and to those who do not, He would have punished you, but His mercy is extended to all
O you who conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship: Do not follow the footsteps of AL-Shaytan (Satan) nor walk in the footsteps of those with characteristics befitting him. And he who follows the footsteps of AL-Shaytan must realize that he incites people and commands their sympathy to commit themselves to immorality and to all that is wrongful and obscene. And had it not been for Allah's efficacious grace and mercy abounding in you, He would never have vindicated any of you, but He does vindicate whom He will and Allah is Sami'un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and 'Alimun
And those of you in whom Allah's grace abounds must not resolve against helping the needy among their kindred and those in want as well as those who emigrated to where they could best serve Allah's cause. It is to their advantage to accord them forgiveness and not to entertain them with thoughts of ill-will. Would you not like that Allah forgives your iniquities, and Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
Cursed indeed here and Hereafter are those who seek to defame the virtuous women who are unaware of what is traduced in propagation, who are attentive to all the duties owed to Allah. They -these traducers- have come within the measure of Allah's wrath here and Hereafter and they must expect the torment that shall be laid upon the damned
The Day shall come when their tongues, their hands and their feet shall have much to answer for against them and bear witness to their actions
There and then shall Allah requite them with what is commensurate with their deeds and what is owed to Him of acts and rites, wherefore they shall realize that Allah is indeed the truth personified
Wicked women accord with wicked men and similarly, wicked men accord with wicked women. They both accord in one and their principles and practice accord well together, whereas women in whose hearts reigns piety accord well with men of piety, and men who are careful of the duties owed to Allah accord well with women of piety, their principles and practice accord well together. These are innocent of all that the wicked traduce in propagation and these are the blessed with the grace of Allah and with blessed provisions
O you who have conformed to Islam: Do not enter houses not your own until you have asked permission and greeted those who dwell therein. This is best for you and mannerly, it is hoped that you shall bear this in mind
And if you find no one therein -or they may be in but not in a condition to receive you- then you must not enter until you are permitted. And if you are asked to go back then you simply go back. This imparts to you sanctity of manners. Allah is 'Alimun of all that you do
However, you are free to enter houses not inhabited but where you gain your end or attain your object or desire (Hotels, guest house, sanctuary and the like); Allah is 'Alimun of all that you reveal as well as of all that you conceal
Say O Muhammad to those of the men who have conformed to Islam to restrain their eyes which includes
And tell the believing women to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts and not expose their adornment except that which [necessarily] appears thereof and to wrap [a portion of] their headcovers over their chests and not expose their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, that which their right hands possess, or those male attendants having no physical desire, or children who are not yet aware of the private aspects of women. And let them not stamp their feet to make known what they conceal of their adornment. And turn to Allah in repentance, all of you, O believers, that you might succeed
And you may unite in matrimony with those who are single man or woman unmarried, legally divorced or widowed and those in whose hearts reigns piety among the men and the women who have been reduced to a servile state; If they are poor Allah will make His grace abound in them. Allah is Wasi'un (Omnipresent) His grace abounds in the Universe, and 'Alimun
And those who cannot marry because they lack the means may conform their life and conduct with the principles of morality until Allah makes His grace abound in them. And those on hand who wish to buy their freedom by performing certain paid-services deserve attention. You reduce a mutually binding agreement to writing if you believe that they qualify -stamped with virtues and sound minds- and give them -in benevolence and/or alms- something of the grace of Allah abounding in you. And do not force your female slaves -or any of your females- into prostitution for a worldly gain -a Pagan custom- nor make them recover their liberty by prostituting their honour if they seek chastity and purity. And he who forces them into sin shall suffer for it, whereas they -the women- shall, under the circumstances be recipients of Allah's Mercy and Forgiveness, for Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
We have sent down to you revelations featuring the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and conducting you from want of spiritual and intellectual sight into enlightenment and illumination. We quoted to you instances of punishment and We discoursed parables by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set fourth and We referred to the fate of some of those who existed before you, all serving as a deterrent and a warning for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
Allah is the Fountain-Head of physical and spiritual light illuminating the heavens and the earth. His light is beyond all comparison, (to be perceived by the human mind), it may be likened to the radiance emitting from a lustrous recess where a lamp stands enclosed in a glass tube or encased in glass featuring extraordinary brilliance as if it were an extra ordinary bright star lit by spiritual invisible combustion from a blessed tree, an olive tree (an ancient emblem of peace) standing in the open, never lost to view. It is not confined to the east nor to the west. Its oil almost emits light although not touched by a flame. Majestic light superimposed upon splendorous light attendant upon a manifestation of Allah Who attracts to His spiritual light whom He will, and Allah discourses to people parables by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth, and He is 'Alimun of all things
In these sacred houses of prayer which Allah had ordained be erected, remembrance applies to Him whose praises are celebrated and whose attributes are extolled morning and evening
By people whose feet are irresistibly drawn to these sacred places by the invisible and spiritual magnetic influence, people who are not distracted by trade or traffic from applying their remembrance to Allah. Nor are they distracted from religious observances, namely the act of worship alms giving, and holding in awe the Day of Judgement when the hearts sink -connoting extreme fear- and the eyes roll toward all and weep at what they are glad of or afraid of
By consequence shall Allah requite them for every deed at the gauge of the best of what they had accomplished and shall make all grace abound in them, Allah provides livelihood and fits out meritoriously and/ or gratuitously whom He will with what He will and with what is necessary for a certain purpose
As for those who deny Allah and do not acknowledge His Messengers' missions, their hopes shall be doomed to disappointment. Their deeds shall avail them nothing but the frustration or non-fulfillment of expectation, a situation standing similitude exact of a mirage* falsely viewed by the parched and thirsty traveler as water, and when he reaches the spot in question his hopes are doomed to disappointment. He finds what is known to be at variance with fact, an optical illusion. But he finds Allah, the Omnipresent, the truth personified, Who requites him with what is commensurate with his deeds, and Allah is swift indeed in putting the law in execution
Or a world of darkness similar to that found in the depth of an ocean where billowy waves are superimposed upon billowy waves topped by dark clouds creating a coat of darkness superimposed upon coats of darkness where he sits or moves misted with darkness that if he stretches his hand he can hardly see it*. And he whom Allah blinds his mind's eyes and darkens his eyes shall he devoid of spiritual light and his hopes shall he doomed to disappointment
Do you not see that all created beings animate and inanimate, in the heavens and on earth submit to Allah and celebrate His praises and extoll His glorious attributes (whether through the bodily structures. or through thoughts expressed in words), and so do the birds upon the wing extending their wings. Each group knows its mode of prayer and its mode of expressing admiration to Allah and extolling his glorious attributes, and Allah is 'Alimun of all that they do
And to Allah alone belong the sovereignty, the supreme dominion and supreme controlling power of the heavens and the earth; and to Him is the end and the purpose for which all are destined
Do you not see that Allah directs the course of the clouds as they form and by the air in motion make them join together in one body, then He condenses them into a dense mass wherefore you see rain drops issue from their midst. And He causes the clouds to heap upon each other like towers of mountains* -as clearly seen from an airoplane- Charged with hail or frozen raindrops, He makes them fall in showers to assail whom He will and drives them away from whom He will. The brightness of lightning emitted between the groups of clouds or between the clouds and the ground almost snatches away or blinds the sight
Allah is He Who causes the day and the night to succeed one another or occur in alternation. This is indeed an instructive example, a great incitement and a lesson to those of intellect who open their minds' eyes and lift to Allah their inward sight
And Allah created every animate being from water*. Some walk, moving or crawling with their bellies touching the ground -worms, reptiles- others are biped who walk on two feet -man and some animals- and others are quadruped which walk on four feet –mammals- Allah creates what He will, Allah is indeed Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things
We have sent down revelations featuring the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and conducts from want of spiritual and intellectual sight into enlightenment and illumination, and Allah guides whom He will to a path of righteousness
And they say: We have conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship and acknowledged His Messenger, recognized his mission and obeyed his principles and commands. Then some of them have second thoughts and their behaviour proves that their words together with their actions do not accord. They refrained from joining the faithful in serving Allah's cause They are not really faithful
When asked to submit their reason to revelation and accept Allah and His Messenger as the arbiters who would judge between them, some of them object and express disapproval when they know they are losers
But when they know they are in the right and they shall justly win the case they do willingly submit
Do they reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being or do they doubt the Messenger's integrity or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger may deviate from the path of justice and from the principle of just dealing! No, but they are indeed the wrongful of actions
Contrast by contrary motives, the response of those in whose hearts reigns piety to the invitation by the Messenger to decide between them according to Allah's statutes and to the Messenger's final judgement is a response of obedience. They always say: "we have heard and we do obey" These are they whom Heaven will prosper
And he who obeys Allah and His Messenger and keeps in awe of Allah and entertains the profound reverence dutiful to Him shall he and such persons be the winners of Allah's mercy and blessings
And they -the hypocrites- make a solemn declaration with an appeal to Allah that should you O Muhammad command them to join forces even though it be at the cost of quitting their homes and forsaking their families, they shall obey. Say to them: "You may spare your oaths, the nature of your obedience declares itself in your actions which together with your words do not accord;" "Allah is 'Alimun indeed of all that you do
Say to them O Muhammad: "Obey Allah and obey His Messenger and comply with their commands." And should you people turn your backs and close your heart's ears then you must realize that the Messenger's responsibility is simply the fulfillment of his duties and you –people- are responsible for the burden of wrongs you bear. Therefore, if you obey him, he is the spirit of truth that shall guide you into all truth, and he is only responsible for relating the divine message and the elucidation of its text
Allah has promised those who have conformed to His system of faith and worship and imprinted their deeds with wisdom and piety a reward, "I shall depute them on earth", He declares "and delegate them to keep the scale and commission them with power to maintain the right", I shall set them in the appropriate social scale just as I deputed those before them in whose hearts reigned piety". "And I will confirm for them the religion I have chosen for them as the appropriate system of faith and worship". "I will also exchange the fear and the dread which fell upon them for peace of mind and soul provided they adore Me with appropriate acts and rites and do not incorporate with Me other deities" And he who henceforth denies, the divine origin of faith -Islam- or this system of faith and worship shall he and such persons be the faithless perverse who are morally depraved
And perform the act of worship and give alms and obey the Messenger of Allah so that you may hopefully invite His mercy and blessings
Do not entertain O Muhammad the idea nor think ever that the infidels are in a position to overpower Allah or upset His plan for those domiciled on earth. They are destined to the abode in Hell and how evil indeed is the destination
O you who have conformed to Islam: Those on hand serving, you and the children who have not reached the age of discretion must ask your permission before entering your rooms when you are improperly dressed: before dawn prayer, when undressed for the afternoon rest -siesta-, and following your last night prayer (when you are reedy to go to sleep); three prescribed periods of privacy. Other than these particular periods you are absolved and so are they to move freely and to come round -in an informal way- attending to each other. Thus does Allah distinctly express to you people His revelations guiding you to the proper way of life relative to moral conduct. Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun
And when your children come of age or reach the age of discretion they must ask permission before they enter homes that are not their own and before they enter rooms where you are sitting and admitting of relaxation in discipline or sleeping, just as those who preceded them behaved. Thus does Allah distinctly express to you His revelations guiding you to the proper way of life relative to moral conduct. Allah is 'Alimun and Hakimun
And those of the women who are past reproductive life ( post menopausal) who have lost hope of matrimonial union are absolved to take oft their outer vestment provided they do not show or display any fictitious additions or adventitious ornaments which draw forth men's interest or cause them to come to them by influencing their appetites. However, if they conform their life and conduct to the principles of morality and use their outer garment, it is much better for them and may guard them against temptation and from being supposed. And Allah is Sami'un and 'Alimun
Absolved from blame are the blind and the lame, the sick and yourselves to eat at the homes of your fathers or your mothers, your brothers or your sisters, at the homes of your paternal uncles or your paternal aunts, your maternal uncles or your maternal aunts or at the homes you possess their keys or at the homes of your friends. Nor do you run into consequence should you eat together or separately. And when you enter houses greet one another with words expressive of good wishes and of Allah's blessings and expressive of courteous recognition. thus does Allah distinctly express to you His revelations guiding you to the proper way of life relative to moral conduct so that you may open your heart's ears and hopefully comprehend
Indeed, the faithful are those who have conformed to Islam and recognized Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and acknowledged His Messenger. And when they are in council with him on a matter of common interest they do not break off individually or in toto until they have been excused. Those of them who ask your permission O Muhammad under the circumstances are indeed true and sincere in their recognition of Allah and His Messenger. Therefore, should they ask your permission to leave for a valid reason, then you may excuse whom you will and invoke on their behalf Allah's forgiveness; Allah is indeed is Ghafurun and Rahimun
O you who have conformed to Islam: Do not address the Messenger in the same manner you address one another nor mention his name without annexing to it an attribute irrespective of whether he is present or absent. Allah is fully aware of those of you who slip away quietly from the assemblies screening themselves behind others. Those who transgress the Messenger's command or willfully neglect it had better know that he who disobeys the Messenger disobeys Allah and by consequence may Allah close their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes or He may wed them to a calamity here and punish them severely Hereafter
Indeed, to Allah belong all that is in the heavens and all that is on earth. He is 'Alimun of your innermost being and of your disposition and your condition, and in Day of Judgement when all are sent back to assemble before Him for Judgement shall He inform them of all that they had done as recorded in their books and attested by their limbs and their senses; Allah is 'Alimun of the whole and of all in all
Praise be to Allah and blessed be He Who has revealed to His servant -the Messenger Muhammad- the Quran which He sent down serving as the canon illuminating the intellect and imparting the soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends and in the choice of what is normally good, honest and Straightforward. it conducts the Messenger to act as a spectacle and a warning to all intellectual created beings
(blessed be He) Who has the sovereignty, the supreme dominion and the supreme controlling power of the heavens and the earth. The Creator Who never allowed anyone to share His Sovereignty or His divine nature. He created the whole and all in all, and each and all He has computed in due proportion to satisfy individual needs and to attain a certain object and a precise purpose
Yet they -the infidels- never deviated into sense and they went further and fared worse by taking false gods besides Allah, objects of worship who and/or which can create nothing -animate or inanimate-; in fact they themselves were created. Furthermore, they have no power to control their own destiny nor can they defend themselves against what is destined to do them harm nor stop what is meant to profit them nor do they have the power to give life nor to cause death -in the divine manner- nor can they effect Resurrection
And the infidels go on to stay: "This -the Quran- is a pack of lies and a pious fraud which he -Muhammad- has devised with the help of others -Ahl AL- Kitab- (people of the book) and he deceitfully uses it for the advancement of his religion. How wrongful can they get and how unjust and impudent can they be to cause what is true to be rejected as false
And they designate the divine discourse a fictitious narrative and say: "Tales of those of old which he -the Messenger- reduced to writing as they are dictated to him morning and evening
Say to them: "This Quran is a divine discourse revealed to man from the realm of heaven; it is sent down by Him Who is Omniscient of the mysteries of the heavens and the earth. He has always been Ghafurun (Forgiving), and Rahimun (Merciful)
And they foolishly say: "What kind of a Messenger is this who eats food and moves about and comes and goes from place to place on foot!" "if only an angel be sent down to accompany him and share his duty and help him accomplish his purpose of warning people against infidelity
Or a treasure were sent down to him from heaven or an orchard put in his possession to use as a source of food. This is besides the allegation of the wrongful who say to those who think alike: "You simply follow a man who has witchcraft on his lips and you foolishly hang on to them
Look how they describe you O Muhammad in -irrelevant- similies reflecting deviation of mind and thought that they are unable to strike on the path of truth guiding into all truth
Blessed be He and exalted are His glorious attributes Who is Omnipotent enough to provide you if He will with what is far better than that they describe -gardens beneath which-rivers flow- and to confer on you gratuitously ownership of palaces
But they went further and fared worse. They denied the predetermined Final Hour. However, We have prepared for those who deny the Day of Judgement the fierce blazes of Hell
No sooner do they come within the range of its sight than they hear its roaring under the influence of rage, heaving sighs of woe for the evil that shall befall them
And when they are cast in its grim confines bound to their kind, and their feet chained to their necks they shall invoke extinction and wish they could perish
But they are told: "Do not invoke extinction once but invoke it repeatedly
Say to them: "Is this troublesome and distressing situation better or the garden of Eternity –Paradise- promised to those in whose hearts reigns piety! the garden which Allah has set apart for the requital of those faithful to Him, and He has determined that it shall be their destination
The garden wherein they shall have whatever object of desire affording pleasure and satisfaction. Any wish they express in words or in thought will be instantly fulfilled, For they will have passed through nature to Eternity; a promise Allah binds Himself to, and treats as an obligation
And in Day of Judgement when He throngs them together with those objects - animate or inanimate- they worshipped, He shall question those gods: "Did you mislead these servants of Mine, or did they stray from the prescribed path of their own accord
Glory be to you. "O Allah", they shall say, and extolled are Your glorious attributes. How could we! when it is not at all befitting to take tutelary guardians besides You! The truth is that you O Allah granted these people together with their fathers comfort and enjoyment and all that advantaged them of Your blessings in life until they forgot to apply remembrance to You and became oblivious of divine revelation. And by consequence they had sealed their own fate and deserved destruction
Then the infidels shall be told: "You see, your gods have accused you of falsehood and want of conformity to fact and by consequence you shall not escape the torment nor can you be afforded help. And now a warning is issued to all, Thus, you people at large must know that he who is wrongful of actions shall taste the torment laid upon the damned
We never sent Messengers before you O Muhammad but were human who ate food and could not survive without alimentation and they moved about from place to place on foot. We also tested the people by exposing opposites -contrary in nature, character, tendency, status, wealth- to each other and those with thoughts of sedition in one toward another. Therefore, will you people -who have conformed to Islam- be persistent, constant and unwearied in the face of difficulties and hindrances and exercise patience! Your Creator is Bassirun (Omnipresent Whose constant vigilance has always been extended to all His creatures)
And those who do not entertain the thought and belief of meeting with Us in Day of Judgement insolently and defiantly say: "If only the angels would be sent down to us or we could distinctly perceive Allah, our Creator, by sight!" They are extravagant in their accounts of themselves. They display inordinate self- esteem and insolently persist in disobedience and in false pride and bury exhortation in oblivion
But the day they see the angels, no joyful tidings shall there be to the wicked who had been given to sin. "You infidels, say the angels, created an impassable barrier between yourselves and Allah's mercy, a barrier which shuts you up in this vast dungeon emitting the torment laid upon the damned
And We apply Ourselves to all that they did and accomplished in life and reduce it together with their infidelity based hope springing eternal in their breasts to a worthless waste as if it were dust dissipated in the wind or mist dispelled by dispersion
Whereas the occasion for those destined to win Paradise shall be a great occasion. A deep joy settles on their spirits for the splendid and stately abode where they repose and live in splendour
The Day shall come when the heavens break into fissures and so do the cumulative clouds -which have gathered from the immense explosions and disruption emblematic of the Final Hour- and the angels are sent down in rows and ranks
There and then shall the true Sovereign Authority and the true meaningful and supreme control be exclusively that of Allah, AL-Rahman. What a day it shall be for those who professed infidelity! a day of extreme difficulties, miseries and hardships
This is the day the wrongful of actions shall bite his hands to intimate regret for all that he had done and for what he had left undone; he will wish he had taken the same path taken by the Messenger
And he adds: "Woe betide me, I wish I did not take such a man for a friend
He misled me and caused my loss in the maze of error and made me reject and neglect the divine and noble discourse which came to my door. Indeed, AL-Shaytan (Satan) seduces man and betrays him to his fall
And there shall the Messenger express to Allah, his Creator his discontent at his people; he says now as he said earlier in life below "O Allah my Creator, I presented to my people Your divine message but my people took a dislike to Your divine discourse -the Quran- and they rejected it as a groundless fiction, and what they formed in their minds they exhibited in action
Thus We applied to every prophet some enemies from the transgressors against the divine law who are characterized by satanic attributes. But enough is Allah, your Creator to be the guide -to whom He will- and to afford help -to whom He will
Again the infidels say: "If only the Quran were revealed to him all at once!" But We reveal it in this manner -gradual growth- to lay it to your heart and establish it firmly so that it prevails upon you O Muhammad and you be confirmed in opinion, action and purpose and We peruse it slowly and We take Our time
Nor do they present you with challenging questions and unreasonable objections but We present you with the truth and the best explanation meeting their objections and their arguments
These are they who shall be thronged in Day of Judgement dragged on their faces in chains to take their abode in Hell. These are they who have assumed the worst position in society here and Hereafter and have chosen the worst path which has sealed their fate
They are not different from those to whom We sent Mussa (Moses). We gave Mussa the Book -AL-Tawrah (The Torah)- and We supported him with his brother Harun (Aaron) whom We appointed a minister to be helpful and conducive to his brother to accomplish his mission
And We said to them: Go both of you to the people who have denied Our revelations and treated Our divine authoritative signs as falsehood. We reduced them to a useless form
And the people of Nuh (Noah) who treated the Messengers as imposters, We drowned them and made of them an example and a deterrent to the people, wherefore We have prepared for the wrongful of actions -and refuse to repent- the torment laid upon the damned
Born to it, and met with a similar destiny were the people of 'Aad -the 'Adites-, the people of Thamud -the Thamudites- and the people of the Rass (possibly the people of Sh'aib of Madyan) and many generations in between who sealed their fate
And to each and all of them did We discourse parables by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth. We set examples of typical instances forming a particular case of a principle. We set examples some relative to action and conduct that induce imitation and others to serve as a warning and each and all We reduced in the end to a useless from
In fact they* in their commercial travels have come repeatedly by the town -of Lut (Lot)- which was showered with the direful rain, but they simply passed by with their minds' eyes closed. It makes you wonder did they not see it!, No, but they do not entertain the fact of Resurrection nor do they regard it with fear should it be true
And as usual their pride gets the better of their prudence. and when they see you, O Muhammad they insolently receive you with nothing but disdain and scorn riding sparkling in their eyes and they express their thoughts in words: "Is this the one", they say " whom Allah has chosen to convey His message
He almost succeeded", they add, "in influencing our thoughts against our gods and he nearly made us err and our sober wishes almost learned to stray, had it not been for our firmness and constancy". But on the day they are confronted with the torment laid upon the damned they shall then realize who had been lost in the blind mazes of entangled wood
Do you see O Muhammad the one whose ruling passion conquers reason and he refers his Ilah to the region of emotions! Do you think you will be responsible for his behaviour or for his inclination! You are only a spectacle and a warning
Or do you think that most of them open their hearts' ears or their minds' eyes! they are like cattle, in fact even worse, for the only path they see is that leading to the loss in the maze of errors
Do you not see how Allah, your Creator, prolonged and lengthened the shadow of any object intercepting the sun or other luminary! Had He willed He would have made it still, and We made the sun the indication asserting the phenomenon, its presence and its dimensions
And then We reduce it to a smaller compass and make it gradually disappear - having been made to contract and vanish by the same invisible hand that made it and creaked it
And He is it Who made the night a vestment, and black was the colour chosen to absorb all light and sleep -the medicine to weariness and the repairer of decay- a repose -which if profound suggests death- and We made the day a phase of revival and resurrection of activity
And it is He Who sends forth the winds as a forerunner of His mercy heralding a joyful event, -rain, vegetation, fertilization- and We send down from the floor of the vault of heaven pure fresh water
Fresh water- with which We revive the dead land of a given town and supply drinking-water to the living among Our creation including cattle and a great many human beings
And We dispersed it among the whole so that they apply their hearts to wisdom and their remembrance to Allah. But most people decline to choose but ungratefulness, disobedience and infidelity
And had We willed We would have sent to the people of every town a spectacle and a warning
Therefore, do not yield O Muhammad to the infidels and wage against them spiritual warfare by the divine means -the Quran- But should they wage war against you, then fight back by physical means
And He is it Who sent the waters of the two seas flowing together, one fresh and sweet and the other salty and bitter and between both He installed an invisible partition which serves as an impassable barrier (the fresh water floats above the salty and there are laws that govern the separation and the depth)
And He is it Who brought into being, out of a watery liquid*, a human and made him evolve lineal descent and join affinity with others, and Allah, your Creator, has always been Qadirun (Omnipotent)
And yet they -some people- adore besides Allah with appropriate acts and rites those who do not profit them nor harm them. But the infidel has always been a physical and spiritual help corroborating and substantiating disobedience to Allah and advocating the evil practiced by AL-Shaytan and by those with characteristics befitting him
Nonetheless, We only sent you O Muhammad to the people as a spectacle and a warning
Say to them -the infidels-: "I do not charge you a price for imparting to you Allah's disclosures of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity, my only reward is to see the one who has decided to open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes and sets himself on the path of righteousness, the path that leads directly to Allah
And rely O Muhammad on the Eternal Who does not die and praise Him and extol His glorious attributes, and enough is He to be fully acquainted with His servants' faults and wrongful actions
Praise be to Him Who created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them and brought them into existence in six days* determined by His own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar, then He set Himself on the throne of supremacy and dominion and of grace and mercy, AL-Rahman, as He is, Whose attributes you may learn when seeking information from Him, the One who knows, Who is Khabirun (Omniscient) of the whole and of all in all
And when they -the infidels- are asked to prostrate their reason to divine revelation and to Him AL-Rahman, they insolently and defiantly ask: "Who is AL- Rahman! Shall we prostrate in reverence and submission to an object of worship just because you enjoin us to do so". Their statement accords with their actions They withdraw further and their mental attitude is an incitement to their aversion
Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes Who installed in the heavens a belt of the celestial sphere divided into twelve equal Parts - signs of the Zodiac*- through one of which the sun passes each month (the belt extends 8 or 9 degrees on both sides of the ecliptic within which the apparent motions of the sun, moon and principle planets take place). He installed therein a lamp, the sun glowing for illumination and a moon earth's satellite dispersing light to dispel the darkness of the night
And He is it who caused the night and the day to follow one upon another and occur in succession**, a phenomenon inciting him who wishes to ponder the marvels of Allah and keep Him in mind lifting to Him his inward sight, wishing to actuate himself with gratitude and gratefulness
(And how richly rewarded shall be: a) The worshippers of Allah who observe religious acts of worship enjoined by AL-Rahman; they walk on earth softly, gently and in humility. When addressed by the insolent and impudent whose imprudence gets the better of them, they answer them with the expression of good will «Peace»
Who spend a good part of the night prostrating their reason to divine revelation and in adoration of Allah, their Creator, lifting to Him their inward sight. They stand in awe of Him and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Who express their thoughts in their invocatory prayer, thus: «Save us and protect us O Allah, our Creator, from the torment of Hell, for its torment is indeed painfully distressing and moves to horror»
How evil it is for an abode and-how evil it is for a habitation
The worshippers who are neither extravagant nor niggardly; when they spend they do not play the prodigal nor do they act parsimoniously, but they use a mean
The worshippers who do not invoke besides Allah another ilah nor do they deprive anyone of life Allah has made sacred, unless it be justified for a proved crime, nor do they commit adultery -in conduct-. He who commits himself to such an evil line of conduct shall pay heavily for these sinful acts
His punishment shall be doubled in Day of Judgement when he will have passed through nature to eternal suffering incensed by multiplied wrongs and humiliations
Unless he has repented -earlier - and imprinted his heart with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and his deeds with wisdom and piety. Such persons shall Allah exchange their evil deeds for pious and virtuous deeds, and Allah has always been Ghafurun and Rahimun
For, he who repents and views his past actions with dissatisfaction and regret and imprints his deeds with wisdom and piety will have in lowliest plight repentant stood and will have turned faithfully to Allah
The worshippers who do not give false evidence nor listen to it, and should they come upon someone whose mouth is full of loud futilities or upon people indulging in personal vanities or in a discourse as futile in effect as it is feeble in principle, they pass by withdrawing nicely and with self- sustained dignity
The worshippers who have hearts and minds submissive to Allah. When they are reminded of Allah`s revelations, marvels and authoritative signs they do not fall upon them with closed ears and eyes but they open their hearts` ears and their minds` eyes
The worshippers Who invoke Allah to give them wives and progeny who make their eyes speak content and to this effect they pray thus: «we pray and beseech You O Allah, our Creator, to grace us with wives and progeny whom we view with concord and content, and make of us models or exemplars of righteousness inducing imitation by those who lift to You their inward sight
These -with all the above-mentioned attributes combined - are they who are destined to receive the richest reward. They shall occupy the high and mighty region in Paradise -Garden of Eden- the epithet of dignity and great honour. This is in token of their patience, forbearance and endurance. Therein they shall be received with hearty welcome and greeted with the best expressions of good will and shall rest eternally assured of peace and security
Wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity. How excellent it is for an abode and how excellent it is for a place to settle in
Say O Muhammad -to the infidels- Allah, my Creator, would not in fact care for you nor attach importance or weight to you had it not been for the few among you who pray and beseech Him for mercy and forgiveness. You have denied the truth and your transgression shall be laid to your charge and you shall have much to answer for
(Tuh), S. (Seen), M. (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, Cannot be emulated
These are divine verses flowing with the precision and grace symbolic of the Book -the Quran- which is the spirit of truth that guides into all truth
Seemingly, O Muhammad you are betaking yourself in pursuit of their -the infidels- train of thought with distress, constant regret and discontent and torturing yourself lest they should refuse credit to this divine message
If We will, We could easily send down to them from heaven a physical sign revealing to them Our Omnipotence and Authority, a sign to which they will have to bend their necks in subjugation and submission
The truth is that no new divine discourse comes to them from their Creator, AL-Rahman but they habitually oppose it, turn away from it in mind and feeling and become actuated by repugnance for it
They labelled the truth -the Quran- as falsehood and counseled deaf to it. But soon shall they realize the truth of all that has been discoursed in this Book which they hold- up to ridicule
Do they not see how We made the earth a source of vegetation and made vegetal growth of like things emerge from it in varying colours with good qualities and of great advantages
This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, but most of them -the infidels- counsel deaf to Allah's message and close their minds' eyes to all that appeals to the intellect and engages the intelligence
Allah, your Creator, is indeed AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Rahim, (the Merciful) Who sends spectacles and warnings and puts punishment in respite
Allah called to Mussa and commanded him Thus: "Go to the people, of Pharaoh" He said, "who are wrongful of actions
Who seem to be unwilling to deviate into sense and for their own sake fear Allah and stop persecuting the Children of Israel
O Allah, my Creator," Mussa said, "I have an easy sense of the probability of being treated as someone who passes himself off as someone other than he is
And my chest becomes drawn tight and my mind and my feeling become strained and my tongue becomes restrained from free expression, therefore I pray and beseech You O Allah, my Creator, to send -The Angel Gabriel- to my brother Harun
And the guilt of blood is at my door and I have ground for alarm for they might kill me
Not at all", Allah said, "Both of you just go with Our signs evincing both Omnipotence and Authority. We will be there with you listening
And so, both of you go to Pharaoh and say to him:" "We are bearers of the divine message sent by Allah, Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come
Who commands you to release the children of Israel from bondage and to let them go with us
Did we not nurture you O Mussa, "said Pharaoh, from infancy as one of us and set you on your feet and you spent of your life among us a good number of years
And you did what you did, -the terrible crime you committed-, and you have impelled yourself to ingratitude and ungratefulness to our grace which abounds in you
I did what I did then", Mussa said, when my action was not circumspect because of the web of circumstances you shaped after your own manner
In consequence I withdrew hastily and took flight when I feared you might avenge your right. But Allah, my Creator, -knowing that the guilt did not reside in my intention- vested me with the capacity of judging rightly in matters relating to life and conduct and with the soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends, and conferred on me the prerogative of being one of the Messengers
And do you Pharaoh", Mussa added, "oblige me and make me feel indebted to you for reducing the children of Israel to slavery and subjecting them to bondage
Pharaoh asked: "and who is Allah, the Creator of the world
The Ilah and Creator of the heavens and the earth" Mussa said, "and of all that is in between if you and your people care to know the truth
Do you hear that!" pharaoh said to those around him
He is Allah", said Mussa, "your Creator and the Creator of your ancestry and of all those included in your genealogical tree
Your Messenger", Pharaoh said to his people, "who has been sent to you is indeed out of his mind and he is carried away by enthusiasm or desire
Not only that" Mussa Added, "but He is Allah, the Creator of the East and the West and of all that lies between them if you really care to deviate into sense
Let me warn you", Pharaoh said to Mussa, "should you take an Ilah besides me, I will shut you up with those shut up in the grim confines of the dungeon
Even if I present you", Mussa said, "with a divine sign convincing the mind and manifests forth the truth
Then exhibit it to view", Pharaoh said, "if indeed you are telling the truth
And there did Mussa cast his staff on the ground and instantaneously it was transformed into a serpent personified
And he drew his hand from the folds of his garment and there it was instantaneously transfigured in a radiance of white divine light
There and then Pharaoh said to the nobility around him: "Indeed, this man is a necromancer skilled in magic, and the works of the devil are clearly manifest in him
He means", Pharaoh added, "To oust you people of your land and drive you away". "Therefore, what course of action do you suggest we should take in the face of this problem
They -the people- suggested to Pharaoh that they should adapt themselves and conform to the time and circumstances and avoid dispute so as to gain time, and they said: "the time to degrade and defeat him has not come yet. Meanwhile, send O Pharaoh some of your recruits to the cities to gather to themselves the multitude of men who practice magic
And ask them to bring back those who are skilled in the art of necromancy
And the magicians were assembled on their known Festive Day
And the people were urged by one another to attend the event so that all of them would come into conformity with the wish that all be present. Expressing their thoughts in words, they added
We accept the authority of the magicians should they win and espouse their opinions and their cause
And when the sorcerers congregated to action they said to Pharaoh: "Assuredly, we will be rewarded should we be the winners
Yes indeed," Pharaoh said, "and you shall be in a position that entitles you to be among my retinue
Mussa said to the magicians, "Cast upon the ground all that you wish to cast
And as they were casting their ropes and rods, they invoked -their god- Pharaoh in supplication for aid and success. They prayed: By Pharaoh's might we will be the winners
And when Mussa cast his staff, it counter-worked their ingenious expedience and swallowed all that they cast upon the ground of fraudulent devices of a mean and deceptive kind
Overwhelmed with wonder, the sorcerers bowed to the ground in comely order, praise and admiration
And they declared submission: "We conform our will", they said, " to Allah's will and we surrender ourselves to Him, the Creator of the worlds
The Ilah of Mussa and Harun
And here said Pharaoh to them: "Have you yielded to his claims and surrendered yourselves to his Ilah without my permission!" "This is indeed," he added, a deceitful plan designed by your master who taught you magic and you shall bear the consequences and soon come to know how heavily you shall pay for this!" "I will amputate your hands and your feet on opposite sides and I will have you all crucified
We are not afraid of this," they said, "We have enough sense to know what we are doing, we welcome your decision which shall haste us unto Allah Who might confer on us the glorious privilege of martyrdom
In fact", they added, "our only hope is that Allah, our Creator extends His mercy to us and forgives us our sins and our sinful acts of fraudulent magic for being foremost in deviating into sense and acknowledging His supreme Sovereignty, Omnipotence and Authority
Meanwhile We inspired Mussa to conduct My servants -the Israelites- by night to the sea and We said to him: "Be sure you shall be followed
Pharaoh sent Messengers to all his cities to call up the people to organize themselves for the hindrance and the defeat of Mussa and his people by contrary measures
He said to them: "Mussa and his people -the Israelites- are only some few contemptible body
And they provoked Our anger and came within the measure of Our wrath which is conducive to annihilation
And We are all cautious and on our guard
Wherefore We compelled them to the natural result of tyranny, disobedience and transgression. We expelled them from the earthly paradise they once possessed and from the land of orchards and springs
the land of treasures and homes and accommodations so splendid
And so it was, and We made the land inheritable by the Children of Israel to whom We conveyed the right of the property after We drowned Pharaoh and his people
They followed Mussa and his people at sunrise
And when the two bodies of men came within each other's range of sight, the compatriots of Mussa exclaimed: " We are evidently overtaken
Not at all", Mussa said, "Allah, my Creator overshadows me with His gracious wing; He is by my side to guide me as He will
We inspired Mussa to strike the sea with his staff and there did the sea split into two enormous divisions, each partition as immense as a huge mountain
And We induced the others -Pharaoh and his people- to tail Mussa and his people who were then in the footpath
And We delivered Mussa and all those with him
And We drowned all the others -Pharaoh and all those with him
This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority but most of them denied Allah, the Creator.(to Pharaoh' people Allah was the Pharaoh himself)
And Allah, your creator, is AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim, indeed
And relate to the people O Muhammad the narrative of Ibrahim with his father
He asked his father and his people: "What do you people worship
We worship idols" they said, and adore them with appropriate acts and rites and we are attached to them and unmoved in mind
Do they hear you", Ibrahim asked, "when you praise them or supplicate
Or do they profit you or hurt
But", they said, "this is exactly the system of faith and worship our fathers adopted
Do you see", Ibrahim said, "all those you adored and revered as objects of worship
And you and your fathers and your ancestors treated with respect and devotion
They are adversaries who might obtain their end and therefore enemies to me but not Allah, the Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come
The Creator- Who brought me into existence and it is He Who guides me to the truth and to the path of righteousness
It is He Who provides me with victuals to eat and drinkables (to drink)
And when I fall sick, it is He Who restores me to health
And it is He Who determines the moment and the cause of my death and occasions my resurrection and restoration to life
The Creator- Whom I hope will relent and quit me all His debt and will forgive me my wrongful actions when I have audience of Him in Day of Judgement
And to Him I express my thoughts in my invocatory prayer, thus: "Confer on me O Allah, my Creator, wisdom to help me judge rightly in matters relating to physical and spiritual life and to impart to me soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends, and unite me, O Allah, with the society of those in whose hearts reigns piety
And furnish me O Allah, my Creator, with a civil tongue uttering the truth that guides into all truth and is believed among posterity
And if you destine me I will be one of those inheriting the Garden of the supreme bliss and blessedness
And extend O Allah my Creator, Your mercy and forgiveness lo my father who was lost in the maze of error". (A prayer invoked by Ibrahim before he realized that his father was an enemy to Allah)
And do not confound me nor occasion me to fall from grace in Day of Judgement
The Day when neither wealth nor progeny shall be of advantage
Except him who comes to the audience of Allah with his heart in its right place, heartened or filled with devotion
This is the Day when Paradise shall be brought quite near to these in whose hearts reigned piety
And Hell is projected for those who were led by the nose to the maze of error and spent their days in vanity
They shall be asked: "Where now are those you revered and adored with appropriate acts and rites
The gods you revered and venerated besides Allah!" Do they afford you help or can they even help themselves
There and then shall they -the infidels- be cast in Hell headlong one batch after another along with those who wasted their days in vanity
And added to them shall be those who served Iblis AL-Shaytan (Satan) all into one gathering and in one place
And when all have been thronged -in Hell- and have exchanged angry altercation, they -the infidels- shall express their thoughts in words
By Allah", they say, "we wandered indeed from the path of rectitude and were lost in the maze of error
We have equalized you -false gods- with Allah, Creator of the worlds
And they add:" no one led us by the nose to the maze of error but the wicked who were given to sin and steeped in crime
And now", they will exclaim, "no one can defend us nor shall we find intercessors who would interpose on our behalf
Nor do we find one who is joined to us in mutual benevolence and intimacy
If only", they say, "we could be given another chance of life below we would be among those who exercise low submissive obeisance to Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority but most of them deny Allah Who brought them into existence
Allah, your Creator, is indeed AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim
Just as averse were the people of Nuh, they declined to accept Allah's message basically the same message conveyed by all the Messengers of Allah before and after Nuh, therefore he who rejects Nuh's message has in fact rejected all Allah's messengers and they suspected the Messengers of falsehood
Their brother Nuh said to them: "Will you not keep in awe of Allah, your Creator, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
I come to you", he added, "with a message Allah has entrusted to me and here do I relate it to you in honour and sincerity
A message exacting your reverence for Allah and obedience to me
I do not", he said, charge you a price for imparting to you Allah's disclosures of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity. My reward rests in the hands of Allah, the Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come
And so revere Him and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and obey me
They said to Nuh: "Shall we submit to you or believe in you and conform to your desire when it is only the contemptible who espoused your cause
But how would I know", said Nuh, "what they were doing earlier or whether or not they had a purpose moving them and inviting their minds to the volition of conforming to Islam
Their case", he added, "shall only be judged by Allah, my Creator, in Whose hands rests the authoritative decision, if only you could apprehend matters with your senses
Nor would I dismiss those who conformed their will to Allah's will
I am only", he added, "a spectacle and a warning
They said; "We warn you Nuh", "unless you stop your course of action you shall be stoned to death
And there Nuh prayed: "My people, O Allah, my Creator, disbelieved me and refused credence to Your message
Judge O Allah", he prayed, "and defend my cause which is the heart of your purpose and decide between me and them in Your way, (for You take the matters of fact as they come and circumstance them after Your own manner) and save me and those with me who conformed to Islam
And there, We saved him along with all those in his society on board the loaded Ark
And We drowned all the others who remained behind
This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, but most of them denied Allah Who brought them into existence
And Allah, your Creator, is indeed the AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim
Just as averse were the people of 'Aad -the 'Aadites- who declined to accept Allah's message and those who conveyed the message
Their brother Hud urged them to what is good and laudable. He said to them: "Will you not keep in awe of Allah, your Creator, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
I am," he added, "A Messenger entrusted with a divine message and here do I relate it to you in honour and sincerity
A message exacting your reverence for Allah and obedience to me
I do not charge you a price", he said, "for imparting to you Allah's disclosures of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity. My reward rests at the hands of Allah, The Creator of the worlds
Do you erect buildings", he added, "on the top of every mount and every height, mansions and stately buildings standing in the landscape, conspicuous to view as though they are landmarks (yet not as a guide nor a mark of an event) serving no useful purpose and of no avail
And you take for yourselves palatial structures as though they will protect you and exempt you from paying nature's debt and help you live forever
And when you strike, justly or unjustly, you strike at the root
And so fear Allah Whose divine nature exacts your reverence and obey me
And entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him Who made all His grace, as you very well know, abound in you
He graced you with cattle and progeny
And with orchards and flowing springs
In fact", he said, "I fear for you an immense punishment on a momentous Day
But they insolently and defiantly said to him: "Whether you exhort Us O Hud or you do not, it is to us one and the same
This is nothing", they said, "other than the customary manner of thinking of those of old used often enough that it bred the same habit in you
Nor, as you think, shall We be subjected to a retributive punishment
And they disbelieved him and refused credence to Our message wherefore We reduced them to a useless form. This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, but most of them denied Allah Who brought them into existence
And Allah, your Creator, is indeed AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim
And just as averse were the people of Thamud (the Thamudites) who refused to accept Allah's message and Messengers
Their brother Saleh said to them: "Will you not listen to exhortation and keep in awe of Allah, your Creator, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
I am", he added, a Messenger entrusted with a divine message and here do I relate it to you in honour and sincerity
A message exacting your reverence for Allah and obedience to me
I do not charge you a price for imparting to you Allah's disclosures of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity. My reward rests in His hands, Creator of the worlds
Do you think", he said, "you will be left to form imaginary visions of unrealities expecting to enjoy the grace of Allah which abounds in you without being tried
You live in splendour, you hold in possession orchards and flowing springs
And vegetal growth and-date palms whose enclosed spadix carries tender delicious and easily digestible fruits
And you skillfully carve the mountains into homes wherein you make abode
A divine grace which exacting your reverence for Allah and obedience to me
And I advise you not to comply with the command of those who are extravagant in their accounts of themselves nor yield to their irreverent principles and authority
They create discord on earth and mischief is natural to them and never do they attempt reform or change for the better
Yet the response of his people was pitifully unfavourable. They said to him: "You are one of those influenced by witchcraft and therefore bewitched
You are only a mortal like us," they said, "wherefore you could not be singled out for the prerogative of prophethood, and if you are indeed declaring the truth then present us with a divine sign convincing our minds and proving the conclusion
This", he said, "is a she-camel which is entitled to a share of the drinking water just as you are entitled to a share. She is to have her share on a certain day and you have yours on an alternate day
And", he added, "you are warned not to harm her lest you suffer the torment laid upon the damned on a momentous Day
Nevertheless they defiantly disabled her by cutting her hamstring muscles. (Their outrage on consecrated objects invited their ruin) which led to pining regrets and vain repentances
They were overtaken by Allah's wrath which spoke thunder. This is indeed emblematic of His Omnipotence and Authority but most of them denied Him Who brought them into existence
Allah, your Creator, is indeed AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim
Just as averse were the people of Lut. They declined to accept Allah's message and those who conveyed the message
Their brother Lut tried hard to induce them to open their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and listen to exhortation. Entertaining expectation of something desired, he -Lut- said to them: "Will you not keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
I am", he added, "a Messenger entrusted with a divine message and here do I relate it to you in honour and sincerity
A message which exacts your reverence for Allah and obedience to me
I" he said, "do not charge you a price for imparting to you Allah's disclosures of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity, my reward rests at His hands Creator of the worlds
Do you realize what you are doing"! he added "of all intellectual created beings, you gratify your sexual appetite by copulating the males
And you forsake your natural mates who are created by Him , for the purpose based upon the innate moral feeling of mankind". In fact you are a people who have defiantly transgressed the divine as well as the moral laws
We warn you Lut", they said, "unless you change your way of thinking and stop -this course of action- you shall be among those ousted from this town and ejected from our society
I am one of those", he said, "who simply detest and abhor your behaviour and your doings which make me shrink with horror
And he prayed "I pray and beseech You O Allah, my Creator, to rescue me and my family from these people who have no horror of immorality, and save us from their social evil
We delivered him along with his family from the people who were wrongful of actions
except a woman who had been carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life, who remained with those behind. (Lut.'s wife who approved this evil practice)
And We reduced the rest to a useless form
We poured down upon them a direful rain (of fire and brimstone) and how evil and devastating was the rain on the heads of those who defiantly ignored Allah's warning
This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority but most of them denied Allah Who brought them into existence
Allah, your Creator, is indeed AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim
Just as averse were the woodlanders -Madyanites- who declined to accept Allah's message and those who conveyed the message
Their brother Shu'aib tried hard to induce them to open their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and listen to his exhortation. Entertaining expectation of something desired, he- Shu'aib - said to them: "Will you not keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
I am", he added, a Messenger entrusted with a divine message and here do I relate it to you in honour and sincerity
A message which exacts your reverence for Allah and obedience to me
I do not charge you a price," he said, "for imparting to you Allah's disclosures of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity. My reward rests in the hands of Allah, Creator of the worlds
Dispense to the full", he said, "the quantity ascertained by measuring if you happen to give or sell by a standard measure and be not of those who serve their purpose and accomplish it by means of fraud, dishonesty and deception
And if you are using the method of weighing then you are enjoined to use an accurate and precise balance conforming to a standard and an exemplar of truth and equity
And crown yourselves with equity", he said, "and do not scant peoples' goods and chattels, chattels personal and chattels real and
And keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him Who brought you and brought all those who came to this world into existence before you
But their response was pitifully unfavourable. They said to him: " You are one of those influenced by witchcraft and therefore bewitched
They added: "you are only a mortal like us wherefore you could not be singled out for Prophethood. In fact we do think you are a pathological liar
And if you are not, and you are indeed declaring the truth, then let us see if you can cause a piece of heaven to fall upon us in the form of discs of cumuli
Allah, my Creator", Shu'aib said "is Omnipresent and He is fully cognizant of all that you do
They disbelieved him and refused credence to Our message wherefore were they seized with a wave of suffocating heat followed by a cumulus which overshadowed them and gave them a rainbow of hope of relief. But it was a joy in which they could not rejoice. It spoke thunder and reduced them to a useless form. It was indeed a torment that befell them on a momentous day
This is indeed emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority but most of them denied Him Who brought them into existence
Allah, your Creator, is indeed AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim
And this Quran is indeed a disclosure of divine knowledge, wisdom and practical divinity sent down to man from Allah, the Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come
It is brought down by Allah's errand, the faithful and honourable Holy Spirit Jibril (Gabriel)
Who imparted it O Muhammad to your innermost thoughts and to the repository of your consciousness so that you serve as a spectacle and a warning
It -the Quran- is revealed in plain Arabic literary form
And it was indeed referred to and proclaimed in the Scriptures of earlier generations
Is it not an attestation to its credit and a ground for belief that the learned among the Children of Israel do know it is the truth
Had We revealed it to a people -characterized with dullness of comprehension or a people slow of perception or foreign to the Arabic tongue
And had the prophet read it to them, they would not have understood it nor welcomed it or given credence to it
Thus do We picture it in the minds and hearts of the sinful who grow daily more and more wicked
Who shall not acknowledge it as the truth personified until they have had the wind in their faces and they are face to face with the promised punishment here, at the hands of the Muslims or with the torment laid upon the damned Hereafter
A punishment that surprises them and catches them unawares and reduces them to ruin
There and then they shall change their minds with regard to past action and conduct and express their hope which springs eternal in their breasts and say: "can we be given respite so that we corrects all the wrongs
Do they mockingly and defiantly wish to hasten Our retributive punishment
Do you see O Muhammad into what would happen if We make all grace abound in them and they enjoy it for years
Then they are suddenly seized with what they were promised of retributive punishment
There and then never shall their possessions and the use af all that afforded them pleasure and advantages avail them or defend them against Allah's decreed punishment
In fact We never reduced a town with its inhabitants to ruin before they have had their spectacles and warnings -and they did not listen
We mercifully sent warnings to make them deviate into sense and wake up to the fact that there is Ilah, the Creator, of the worlds, Who exacts reverence and veneration and obedience from all created beings. And never did We fail lo observe the principles of justice and fair dealing
And such divine discourse as sacred as the Quran just cannot be the work of evil Spirits nor are they permitted to touch it, not to mention being responsible for bringing it down
Nor is it befitting that they be employed by Allah in conveying His sacred message nor can they apply themselves to this purpose
They are altogether excluded from audition. In fact it is quite beyond their limit of audition
Therefore, do not invoke another god besides Allah lest you should join those who shall suffer the torment to be laid upon the damned
And warn O Muhammad your next and near kin
And be well and kindly disposed to those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues who fell into line with you and take them under your wing
But should they disobey you then they will have disobeyed Allah and disregarded His laws. Then say to them O Muhammad: "I am innocent of your ills and of all that you do
And put your trust in the AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim
Who sees you when you stand alone in the act of praying
And sees your change of position and variation of posture among the assemblage as they prostrate their reason to divine revelation and bow to the ground in reverence, in worship and adoration
He is indeed AL-Sami' (with unlimited audition) and AL-'Alim
Shall I tell you whom do evil spirits pursue and on whom do devils descend
They descend -not on the prophets of Allah- but on every sinful liar who intentionally asserts what is false and relates it to Allah and clothes himself with the vesture of wickedness
who open their hearts' ears to misrepresentations and vanities and to what the Devils impart to them of falsities and most of them (those who relate and those who receive) are liars. The pagans labelled the Quran as poetry and the Prophet as a poet while the difference is obviously vast. A. The Quran invites to a straight course aiming at a specific Purpose and a useful end. The Prophet's words together with his deeds accord, he does not say something today and cancels it tomorrow nor does he yield to emotions and desires but insists on a divine course of action and does not change nor deviate. On the other hand poets are captives of their emotions, their imagination and of the changing atmospheres and temperaments. When pleased they say one thing and when displeased they say another thing, whereas the Quran adheres eternally to the same thing. B. Poets may be good poets (poets of literary merit), poetic antiquarian (poet with another quality), poeticule (insignificant ), poetaster (a writer of trashy verse) a rhymester. Some of them engage in feigning and devising fables and others aim to please. C. Therefore those whose ruling passion conquers reason who refer their way of life and course of action to the region of poetry or emotions are wasting their days in vanity
And the poets are followed as the exemplar or the model by those whose ruling passion conquers reason and they refer their course of action and way of life to the region of poetry or emotions and waste their days in vanity
Do you not see that they rove the trackless realms of every valley of emotion, imagination and discourse
And their words together with their deeds do not accord, they say what they do not do
Excepting those of them who acknowledge Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds of wisdom and piety. They often apply their remembrance to Allah and they are able to reclaim themselves and triumph over the enemies of Islam who have wronged them, and who shall come to know what kind of destiny awaits them
(Ta) S. (Seen) the Surah opens with these, introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated. These are the divinely discoursed verses flowing with the precision and grace symbolic of the Quran, which is the spirit of truth guiding into all truth
It is a guide leading and directing mankind in their course of action, way of life and in the manner of conducting themselves and their affairs besides being joyful tidings to those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Who engage in the act of worship and give alms -for alms are but the vehicles of prayer- and look at the Hereafter as the most undoubted event
As to those who deny the Hereafter and refuse to admit the truth of Resurrection, they have lost the intuitive recognition and perception of the truth. Acting upon their struggle in defiance of the truth, We have allured them to a brighter present and a happier destiny so that their minds be thrown into confusion and lose sight of the truth until they commit themselves to loss in the maze of error
These are they who are destined to the torment laid upon the damned. They are the biggest losers-whose crime has lost them all hope of forgiveness
And you -Muhammad, the chosen recipient- do receive the Quran, sent down to you, from its prime Source, The Originator of all knowledge, Who is Hakimun (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensation,) and 'Alimun (the Omniscient)
Mussa said to his family: I have just seen a fire, you stay here, I might be able to fetch you some information relative to the direction we pursue or fetch you a brand from the burning wood to kindle a fire to warm you up
And when he reached the destined spot, he was called to and was told: "Blessed be those who are in the fire and those around, and extolled are the glorious attributes of Allah, The Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come
O Mussa," the voice continued, "I am Allah and it is only I, AL-Aziz (the Almighty), AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
Drop your staff". He said to Mussa. And when Mussa saw it moving as though it were a serpent personified, he withdrew in the face of danger and did not return. But he was told: "O Mussa do not be afraid and cast out of your mind the emotion of fear, for My Messengers fear naught in My immediate presence
Except him who has deviated from equity, justice and goodness. but, he exchanged; thereafter the evil for what is good shall he and such persons find that I am indeed AL-Gafur (the forgiving) and AL-Rahim
And, Allah added, "put your hand into your bosom it shall come out transfigured in a radiance of white divine light unharmed and all sound, one of nine divine signs you shall present to Pharaoh and his people who have confirmed themselves in the horrid purpose and the ill intention
And when Our divine convincing signs were presented to them they blinded their minds' eyes and labeled them as magic with over-mastering influence
Unjustly and with inordinate self-esteem, they refused to accept these signs- as emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, notwithstanding that they had a sense perception of the truth in their innermost beings And you can see how fatal was the consequence which united all those characterized with playful malice
And We bestowed on Dawud (David) and Sulayman (Solomon) divine knowledge for which they were grateful and they expressed their gratitude in words, thus: "Our bosoms", they said, "surge forth answering thanks to Allah Who has privileged us with what is beyond the common advantages of others of His votaries whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues
And then did Sulayman inherit Dawud's kingdom, spiritual insight and the prophetic office -attributes do not usually go from father to son- and there did he address his people, thus: "O you people" he said, "we have been gracefully taught the language of the birds and we have been granted -by Allah- something of everything, and this is indeed His efficacious grace effecting the end for which it is given
And to Sulayman were thronged his forces embodying arrays of the Jinn, the men and the birds marshaled in proper order
And when they reached the valley of the ants -where ants formed a great number of communities or colonies- one ant said to the rest: O you ants go back to your dwellings so that Sulayman and his hosts do not crush you unawares
And there did Sulayman's countenance turn expressive of pleasure and amusement and he laughed at what he thought was indeed incredible and at once he prayed: "O Allah, my Creator", I pray and beseech You to actuate me with the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness for Your grace and blessing and Your beneficent gift you bestowed on me and my parents Help me impress my deeds with wisdom and piety to Your satisfaction, and in mercy to me, admit me O Allah, my Creator, into the realm of those of Your votaries in whose hearts reigns piety
And he inspected the birds and took a muster of them, only to find one missing, he said: "Why do I not see the hoopoe or has he been among the absentees!" (A bird of the family upupidae especially the typical upupa epops, conspicuous by its variegated plumage and large erectile crest)
I will punish him severely", he said, "or I will slaughter him unless he gives me a convincing excuse
And there and not far came forth -the hoopoe- into view and said : "I have learned something you have no knowledge of and I have brought you some objectively certain news from the kingdom of Saba
I have found, "the hoopoe continued, "that a woman reigns over them and all grace abounds in her and she has a great throne
I found," he said, "that she and her subjects pay reverence and veneration to the sun in lieu of Allah and they display that by appropriate acts and rites. And AL-Shaytan (Satan) has allured them to a brighter present and a happier destiny as a logical result or sequence to their doings and He blinded their eyes to the path of righteousness and led them by the nose to their loss in the maze of error
They do not worship Allah Who brings to light what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows all that people conceal and all that they reveal
Allah, there is no Ilah but He the Absolute Sovereign of the Supreme Throne of dominion and authority, of grace and mercy
And there Sulayman said: "We will see whether you have stated the truth or you are one of those speaking falsely or conveying a false impression
Take this message of mine", Sulayman said, "and drop it in the palace then wait to see what kind of response they shall give
She -the Queen- said to her counselors: "O you counselors, I have just received an honourable letter which has been dropped into my quarters
It is from Sulayman," she said, "and it reads, quote: "In the Name of Allah, AL-Rahman, and AL-Rahim
Do not let your pride get the better of your prudence and I expect you to come to me with low submissive reverence for Allah Who exacts reverence and obedience from every Created being
Her anxiety prompted her to consult with her counselors. She said: "O you counselors, I seek counsel from you in this matter. I never decided upon a course of action before presenting it to you for an opinion
They said: "we are people who face danger with boldness, firmness and courage and we exercise powerful and vehement opposition, but it rests in you to decide this matter
The problem is" she said, "that when kings make –hostile- entry into a country to take possession of the land they plunder it and they humble its superiors and render them inferior, and this is what they usually do
I have resolved" she said, "to send them a present and wait to see what kind of response will the envoys bring back
And when the envoys presented Sulayman with the present he said: "Do you provide me with wealth!" "What Allah has conferred on me of His grace that abounds in me far excels all that He has bestowed on you. In fact, it is you - people- who would rejoice with such a gift beyond a common joy". It is evident, said Sulayman, that they rejoice at worldly gains whereas We rejoice at inviting to the path of Allah, for which cause we are ready to fight
Go back to them. We will confront them with such forces as they can never withstand and oust them from thence and drive them away humbled and humiliated
Then he said to the leaders of his assemblage -of the men and the Jinn-: "Who among you can fetch me her throne before they come to me with low submissive reverence for Allah
I can fetch it right here" said a very strong Jinn, "before you assume the standing position and I am powerful enough to be trusted for such an undertaking
But said he who was imbued with spiritual Knowledge of the Scriptures and with some limitless spiritual power conferred on him by Allah. "I will fetch it to you before the time taken in twinkling your eye*" And when he -Sulayman- found -the throne- set right there he prayed: "This is indeed an instance of the grace of Allah conferred on me to test my inclination whether I will propound gratitude or ingratitude. And he who is actuated with the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness, he but serves his own interest and he who sets himself in defiance of Allah must realize that Allah is Ghaniyun (Independent, Absolute, Self-sufficient) and Karimun (Beneficent)
Sulayman then said to his assemblage: "Disguise her throne to see whether she will be able to recognize it or she will be one of those who lack insight and do not discern the truth
And when she arrived -and was welcomed by Sulayman- she was asked: "Does your throne look like this!" "It certainly looks," she said, "as if it were it" "And with Allah's mercy and grace", said Sulayman to his retinue, "we were given the divine knowledge which is the spirit of truth guiding us into all truth long before her and by consequence we conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship, we conformed to Islam
What dissuaded her against paying reverence and veneration for Allah and induced her to revere other objects -such as the sun- instead, was intimately connected with her birthright; she was born and reared in an atmosphere of paganism
As the honoured guest of Sulayman she was invited to enter the palace and as she did she thought the brilliant floor was a lake and she drew up the hem of her clothes, but there she was told that that was not water but a floor paved with slabs of glass. There and then she paused and declared: O Allah my Creator, she said, "I have wronged my own soul and here and as of now I exercise with Sulayman low submissive reverence in Islam for Allah the Creator, of the worlds
And We sent to Thamud -the Thamudites- their brother Saleh to exhort them to pay low submissive reverence for Allah but they were divided among themselves into two parties occasioning disputes against each other leading to hostile feeling and action
He -Saleh- said to them -to those who disbelieved him and challenged his warnings-: "O my people, Why do you defiantly wish evil be hastened on rather than good! If only you invoke Allah's forgiveness He might hopefully extend His mercy to you
But they wickedly said: "We esteem you and those with you as birds of evil omen presaging some direful events." "Indeed," he said, "events portending good or evil and all that is destined to happen rest at the hands of Allah; the fact is that you are people put to the test
Among the leaders in Saleh’s town were nine men whose wickedness exceeded all limits and reached an irreversible degree, they flourished at spreading mischief in the land and at creating discord
They mutually agreed and resolved under oath (their kind of oath) to launch an attack upon him -Saleh- and his people by night to finish them off and rid the town of them and then declare their innocence to his next of kin and insist on their statement, thus: "We", they would say, "were never present at the scene of the massacre of his people and this is the truth
And with cleverness in circumventing, they had recourse to stratagem and in Our plan We also had recourse to stratagem which they failed to perceive
And now look at the fatal consequences of their cunning. We simply reduced them together with their people to a useless form
And you can see how their dwellings stand dilapidated over hills of ruin as a sequel to their iniquities. This is emblematic indeed of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and a significant sign appreciated by people who comprehend
And We saved those of his people whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
And in a similar manner did We deal with the people of Lut who said to them: "O my people, do you commit such an immorality as is contrary to the general inherent character and moral constitution when you discern what is moral from that which is morally evil
Certainly" he continued, "you have sensuous desire for men in lieu of women; you are a people who are indeed ignorant and indeed impudent, a people who have no shame of their sins
And what was the response of his people other than to say: "Oust them -Lut and his family and those who fell in line- of your town and drive them away. They are averse to our disposition and wish to cleanse themselves of what they imagine to be moral defilement
And We saved him and his family but not his wife whom We decided was among those destined to be left behind
We poured down upon them a direful rain –of fire and brimstone- how evil and devastating was the rain on the heads of those who defiantly ignored Allah's warning
Declare O Muhammad, the praise of Allah and make a return to Him in evidence of obligation, thus: "To You O Allah do I express my gratitude and gratefulness". And pray and beseech Him for peace that it be extended to those of His worshippers whom He chose to convey His message. Ask -the infidels- "Who is better, Allah (the Unique, the Omnipotent and the Omnipresent) or those -who are helpless- whom they incorporate with Him
Ask them: "Who was He Who created the heavens and the earth and caused rain water to fall from the floor of the vault of heaven to serve as the means of causing beautiful orchards to grow, an action proper to Allah alone! If you people had tried hard to cause the trees* thereof to grow you would have utterly failed. Is this not an action distinctly and exclusively peculiar to Allah! Or is it to a god incorporated with Him! Yet they are a people who ignorantly and impudently place the objects they worship -false gods- on an equality with Allah
Who was He Who set the earth at Creation in the order of a settled habitation** where you established your abode and He permeated into it rivers and placed in it stays –mountains*- in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, and installed a natural barrier*** between the two waters -the fresh and the salt-! Was it another Ilah with the Almighty Allah! The truth is that most of them are ignorant of the facts
Who is He who responds to the invocation of the distressed when he invokes His help and sets him free from what caused him misery and exhausted his mind, and Who makes you inherit those who came to this world before you! Is it an Ilah incorporated with Allah! How little indeed you bear Allah in mind
Who is He who guides you in the darkness on land and at sea and Who sends the wind as a forerunner of His mercy heralding a joyful event! Is it an Ilah sharing the Omnipotence and Authority of Allah! Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely far beyond all those they incorporate with Him
And Who is he Who starts creation and repeats it and creates and recreates who provides you with your livelihood from heaven above you and from the earth below you! Is it another god with Allah! If so then produce your evidence if indeed you're declaring the truth
Say to them O Muhammad: "No one ever knows the hidden, the unknown and the unseen nor what the future holds in the heavens and on earth but Allah alone and never do they know when they shall be resurrected to face judgement
No, but their knowledge of the Hereafter has reached a dead-lock giving occasion to uncertainty. No, but their doubt stands as the beacon of the unwise, in fact, their notion of the Hereafter has fallen on the blind spot
And yet the infidels still say: "Do you mean that after we and our fathers have been reduced to dust, we; can be resurrected
We" they add, "have been promised that before and so have our fathers; this is indeed nothing but fables of old
Say to them O Muhammad: "Journey the land and open your minds' eyes to see for yourselves the fatal consequence which united all those who persisted in crime
And do not be grieved at heart for their denial of the divine message nor for their hearts which dare rise defiant against Allah, nor should you be sorely distressed on account of their cunning which they take for a sinister and crooked wisdom
And in their challenge to the occurrence of punishment they say: " When will that promised punishment come to pass if indeed you are declaring the truth
Say to them O Muhammad: "It is hoped that some of what you have been promised and wish it be hastened on may overtake you now
Indeed, the grace of Allah, your Creator, abounds in people but most of them show indisposition to acknowledge His bounty and display want of gratitude
Allah, your Creator is Omniscient indeed of all that is reposited in their breasts of private thoughts and feelings and of all that they conceal and He is Alimun of all that they reveal
And nothing of the unknown, the unseen or the hidden in the heavens or on earth but is recorded in the archetypal book
Indeed this Quran tells the Children of Israel plenty, and informs them of the truth of most of the subject matter which set them at variance
It is the spirit of truth guiding them into all truth and a mercy to those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Allah, your Creator, shall judge between them in Day of Judgement with justice and equity; He is AL-Aziz and AL-'Alim
And so, put O Muhammad your trust in Allah. You are in the right and you act in accordance with what is just and good, equitable and morally fitting
But you shall not be able to make your voice reach the spiritually dead nor shall you be able to make it reach the worthless who counsel deaf nor do they open their hearts' ears when they turn their backs
Nor shall you be able to guide those who lack intellectual or spiritual perception and their minds' eyes are blind nor can you extricate them or disengage out of the entangled wood of error. You can only influence those who listen to you and give credence to Our revelations and to Our authoritative divine signs with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, for such persons have indeed conformed to Islam
And when time is propitious for Allah's predetermined special occasion to come to pass and they-the infidels - come to meet with their destiny, We introduce to them a beast from the earth to discourse with them and say to them: "The infidels had always denied Allah's revelations and authoritative signs. What do you think of the signs now
The Day shall come when We throng from every nation a group of those Who rejected Our message and denied Our authoritative divine signs. They shall be driven ahead like herds one flock behind the other
Until they have all assembled before Him for judgement. Then shall He question them "Did you not deny My revelations and authoritative divine signs when you did know their significance! What was it you were doing and what was it you had in mind
And now that what was predicted and destined to happen as a reaction to their iniquities has come to pass, they are stricken dumb unable to put forward a plea neither in abatement nor in bar of an action or prosecution
Did they not see that We designated for them a period of darkness - the night- to take their natural repose and recuperate*, and a period filled with light -the day- to have clear perception of things and acquire experience of the activities of human existence! phenomena emblematic indeed of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority that are appreciated and faithfully recognized by people who bow down their ears to the truth
The Day shall come when the trumpet is sounded indicative of Resurrection and Judgement, and there shall all those in the heavens and all those on earth be shocked with startling intense horror except those whom Allah shall exempt as He will and all shall be brought before Him in low submissive reverence and humility
And you see the mountains you think they are motionless while in fact they move as fast as the clouds -when driven by the wind
He who crowns his deed with equity and good will shall advantage himself of the profit accruing therefrom and shall be exempt from the shocking occasion of the exciting intense horror, feeling safe and secure
And he who crowns his deed with inequity and or iniquity shall be cast in Hell headlong with his damnable face downward, and be told: "Are you not requited but with what is commensurate with your deeds
Say to them O Muhammad: "I have been commanded to worship and serve Allah, The Creator and the Supreme Master of this town -Macca- which He rendered sacrosanct and to Whom belong the whole and all in all, and I have been commanded to be one of those who have conformed to Islam
Also to recite the Quran to be meaningful to the people". Then he who is steered by the spirit of truth into all truth and Providence is his guide benefits his own soul and he who errs and strays from the path of righteousness, you just say to him O Muhammad: "I am only a spectacle and a warning
And say to them: "Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes, He shall exhibit to you His authoritative divine signs and His marvels which you shall inevitably recognize. Allah, your Creator, is not unmindful nor is He oblivious of all that you do
(Tah), S. (Seen), M. (Meem) the Sarah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
These are divinely discoursed verses flowing with the precision and grace symbolic of the Book -the Quran- which is the spirit of truth that guides into all truth
Here, We narrate to you O Muhammad in truth some information relative to Mussa and Pharaoh to relate it to the people whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues
Pharaoh installed himself in the land in the office of dignity and tyranny, and divided the people into parties and leaned heavily against one of them, brutally slaughtering their new born males and purposely sparing their females. He was indeed mischievous creating diversity and discord
And We decided to be kind and gracious to those who were suppressed and subdued in the land and to change their status and bring it into that of spiritual leadership intended to lead and inherit the land
We decided to confirm and establish them firmly in the land and confront Pharaoh and Haman and their troops with what they feared might happen to them at their hands, the hands of Mussa whom they reared and the Israelites who followed his law
We inspired Mussa's mother, thus: "Breast feed him until you feel that fear falls upon you for his life, then put him in a chest and cast him into the river and do not be afraid nor grieve at heart. We will restore him to you and confer on him the prerogative of Apostleship
The waves swept him ashore and there, he was picked up by the family and the household of the Pharaoh who did not realize that he would be their avowed enemy who would cause them limitless misery and endless grief. Pharaoh, Haman and their troops were indeed transgressors against the principle of good and were sinful offenders against Allah
And there, Pharaoh's wife said to Pharaoh as she saw the child: "a comfort and joy to the eye, he will make my eyes and yours speak content". She gave orders to the guards: "do not kill him. He might be of some quality that brings about good or advantage and he might be helpful in effecting a purpose or we might adopt him as a son. She was totally unaware of what the future held
Meanwhile, Mussa's mother was left with an unsatisfied feeling and with a heart experiencing an aching void the world could not fill, she almost betrayed him had We not emboldened her heart to fall in line with those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues
She -the mother- said to his sister: "Search for him and keep track" And his sister saw him at a distance and she controlled her emotions and kept a state of indifference so that Phraoh's people would not recognize the relationship
And We had already made him reject and refuse breast feeding from all the women who were available to suckle and nurse a strange child. So conditioned, his sister suggested to Pharaoh's household a solution, she said: "Shall I tell you of a family who would rear him and take good care of him for you
And there, did We restore him to his mother so that she would be delighted and her eyes speak content and she would take off the robe of grief and realize that the promise of Allah is an absolute certainty even though most people are indeed ignorant of this very fact
And when he -Mussa- reached maturity and was capable of fulfilling the obligation and the trust, We bestowed on him an exalted position. We imparted to him wisdom and divine knowledge. Thus do We requite those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
He entered the city unnoted by its people (who might have retired for the siesta or the night) only to find two men fighting, one of the same law and the other of his foes-an Egyptian: His co-religionist sought his help against their enemy and there Mussa cuffed him with the fists and the man dropped dead. There and then said Mussa: "This is indeed a Satanic incitement, for this is the work of AL-Shaytan (Satan) who is an avowed enemy instigating deviation from the path of righteousness
And he invoked Allah's mercy and forgiveness: "O Allah, my Creator, he prayed: "I have wronged my own soul. Forgive me O Allah and have mercy on me." Allah forgave him and extended to him His mercy; He is AL-Ghafur (the Forgiving), and AL-Rahim (The Merciful)
And he added: "O Allah, my Creator, since You have been gracious to me I promise I will never be a help to those who are disposed to the practice of evil
From then on he came to be apprehensive of impending danger expecting at any moment to be arrested and prosecuted and either tortured or killed. And in this state of anxiety and fear he met his same co-religionist whom he had helped the day before crying for his help today. Mussa said to Him: "You are indeed quarrelsome and alienated from Allah
Nevertheless, he felt like attacking the man who was their enemy but in making the attempt the man said to him: "Do you wish O Mussa to kill me as you killed a man yesterday?" "You seem to be eager to exercise power and to play the tyrant in the land and not to brew reform
Meantime there came a man from the far end of the city. He said to Mussa: "The chiefs are convening to deliberate upon killing you, therefore you had better leave the city. I hope you do realize that I am offering you a sincere advice
Mussa took the man's advice and left the city in a state of anxiety and fear expecting to be seized with a calamity at any moment. Feeling helpless he invoked Allah for help, thus: "Protect me O Allah, my Creator. and save me from the people who are wrongful of actions
Journeying toward Madyan he said to himself: "Perhaps Allah, my Creator will guide me out of this fearful country into the path of truth and safety
And as he arrived at the spring waters of Madyan he found a large crowd of people watering their flocks. Among them he found two women trying to keep back their flocks. He asked them: "What is your trouble?"; "we cannot water our flocks", they said, "until the shepherds have driven off their flocks and our father is quite an old man
Mussa watered for them their flocks then assumed a place in the shade and prayed: "O Allah, my Creator," "with all Your grace that abounds in me I am indigent and-lonely
Unexpectedly, there came back one of the two women walking with a womanly propriety of behaviour, chastity of thought, speech and conduct. She said to him: "My father invites you to requite you for the service you rendered to us, watering our flocks". And when he went and met with the father and told him his story, the father said to him: "Do not be afraid, you have already gotten off safely and escaped from the people who are wrongful of actions
And there, said one of the women to her father: "Would you hire him O father, for the best you can hire is the reliable man who is rather strong and worthy of trust
The father said to Mussa: "I wish to offer you one of my daughters in matrimonial union on contrition that you serve me for eight years and should you like to add two more years to make them ten, it will be of your own accord". "I do not wish," he added, "to make things difficult for you and you will find me, Allah willing, one of these in whose hearts reigns piety
This", he added, "is an agreement between me and you, whichever of the two terms be fulfilled, there shall be no injustice or ill-will to me and Allah is a Witness to our binding agreement
And when Mussa had fulfilled the term agreed upon and departed with his family he perceived a fire on the mountain side of Tur (Tor) He said to his family: "I have just perceived a fire, you stay here. Perhaps I might be able to get some information relative to the direction We pursue or fetch you a brand from the burning wood to kindle a fire to warm you up
And when he reached the destined spot he was called to from the tree on the right side of the valley at the sacred ground, thus: "O Mussa", he was prompted, "It is I, Allah, Creator of the worlds, the visible and the invisible, past, present and those to come
Drop your staff", Allah said to him. When he -Mussa- saw it moving as though it were a serpent personified he withdrew in the face of danger and did not return. "Come back O Mussa", he was prompted "and do not be afraid. You are indeed one of those who enjoy safety
Put your hand", He was told, "into your bosom and it shall come out transfigured in a radiance of white divine light unharmed and all sound, and draw your hand to your side to put off the robe of fear". "These are two divine signs evincing both My Omnipotence and Authority to present to Pharaoh and his peers, for they have been a people who confirmed themselves in the horrid purpose and the ill-intention
And there said Mussa: "O Allah, my Creator, I killed one of them and I fear they might kill me
My brother Harun (Aaron) expresses himself much better than I and he possesses the power of fluent, forcible and appropriate expression. Send him O Allah with me to be a support and to confirm my cause, for I fear they might accuse me of falsehood
Allah said: "We will strengthen you by a main stay, your brother Harun, who will be your right arm and We will impart to you divine power and authority so that they shall not be able to apply themselves ever to that degree which is level with your delegated capacities. Victory shall sit on your helm, you and your brother, and the helm of all those who fall in line with you
And when Mussa presented to them Our convincing divine signs with distinct apprehension of all that they involve, they said: "This is indeed nothing but witchcraft fabricated for deception. We never heard of such things discussed by our fathers
It is only Allah," said Mussa, "Who knows those whom He sent with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and He knows those who are destined to win the bliss Hereafter when the wrongful of actions shall not find one single instance of physical or spiritual prosperity
And here addressed Pharaoh his peers: "O you peers of the realm", he said, "I never knew an Ilah to whom you pay reverence and veneration but myself. Therefore, bake for me O Haman -his grand vizier- the moulded bricks of clay with fire and erect for me a lofty building soaring skyward, I might find the means of mounting to the Ilah of Mussa whom I deem a great liar
And there did Pharaoh and his hosts turn indignant and unjustly displayed in the land inordinate self-esteem and extravagance in their accounts of themselves and had a notion in their minds that never shall they be brought back to Us
And by consequence We surrounded him and his troops and cast them into the sea and you can see the fatal consequence of the wrongful of actions
And We justly incited them to compete for superiority in iniquities and be the leaders thereof, an attribute that led them and those who fell in line with them directly to Hell and no help whatever shall they receive in Day of Judgement
And We glued them a curse here and with disgrace Hereafter when they shall be viewed with contempt
And after We had reduced the earlier generations to a useless form We gave Mussa the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah) to serve as a divine evidence engaging the intellect and a spirit of truth guiding into all truth and a mercy extended by Allah so that they may hopefully lift to Him their inward sight and keep Him in mind
You Muhammad were not at the western side of Mount Tur at the time We imparted to Mussa the divine knowledge and entrusted him with the Book and empowered him to do the intended duty nor were you a witness of the event
Not only that, but since then We have raised up generations over the years and it is an age since then that people have forgotten the covenants they ratified. Nor did you live among the Madyanites -of Madyan- to narrate to your people their stories and events with such precision! But We sent you and We imparted to you the informative knowledge
Nor were you at the side of the Mount when We called to Mussa, but it is the mercy of Allah extended to you to serve as a spectacle and a warning to a people who never received a spectacle and a warning before you, that they may hopefully ponder
Had We not sent you O Muhammad to the people in general and to the Pagans in particular to serve as a spectacle and a warning they would have said when befallen with a misfortune as a reaction to what their wrongful and unclean hands have committed: "O Allah, our Creator, if only You had sent to us a Messenger to guide us to Your path in which Your divine signs shine like beacons inciting us to lift to You our inward sight
And now when they have received Our spirit of truth guiding into all truth they say: "If only he -the Messenger- were given divine signs similar to those given to Mussa!" Did they not reject the signs We equipped Mussa with before! and did they not label both AL-Tawrah of Mussa and the Quran as presentations of falsehood and designated them two related subjects complementing one another on the work of magic and they said: "We simply deny and reject each and all
Say to them O Muhammad: "If indeed you are declaring the truth then try to bring down from the realm of heaven a better book that you consider to be the truth that guides into all truth and I will be happy to follow it
And if such an undertaking they fail to fulfill (and fail they undoubtedly will) then you will realize O Muhammad that they simply follow their own wishes and that they act upon their own desires. And who is more perverse than him who yields to his own imagination not based upon reason nor upon divine guidance! Allah does not guide the wrongful of actions
We have already imparted to them the divine knowledge to guide then into all truth that they may hopefully lift to Allah their inward sight and keep Him in mind
And those to whom We gave the Book before this Book -the Jews and the Christians- do acknowledge the Quran and the truth of your divine mission
When it is recited to them they express their thoughts in words. They say: "We do acknowledge Allah's divine discourse represented in the Quran for it reflects the divine truth notwithstanding that long before the Quran We conformed to Islam
Such persons shall be requited in double, for their suffering and for enduring pain and hostilities, for their constancy in labour, exertion and effort and for their forbearance under provocation. They repel pride with prudence and evil with good and they spend in benevolence and benefaction of the provisions of life We provisioned them
These are they who do not pervert their senses. When they hear idle talk gossip or slander they refrain from listening and turn away and say to the profaners: "We are responsible for our deeds and you are response for yours; peace be upon you. We are not interested in the ignorant who have no shame of their sins
You Muhammad shall not be able to guide to Allah's path whom you like or to whom you have special affection* but Allah guides to His path of righteousness whom He will and He knows best those who are willing to lift to Him their inward sight
And they -the infidels- say to you: " Should we fall in line with you and follow your exhortation we will be ousted from our land and be robbed of our rights and privileges!" Did We not confirm to them on a secure basis a safe and sacred Sanctuary secured by religious sentiments and reverence against violation, infringement or encroachment. We caused the flow of all kinds of fruits and the products of everything to its environ; a livelihood provided by Us albeit most of them are ignorant of this fact
How many towns did We reduce to a useless form after Our grace was made to abound in them and they met it with dissatisfaction and ingratitude! There you can see how their dwellings were left desolate thereafter and destitute of inhabitants but of a few and We were the inheritors
And never did Allah, your Creator, reduce the towns to a useless form until He had sent a Messenger to their capital to recite to the people Our divine revelations but they closed their hearts' ears. Therefore, never did We reduce the towns to a useless form except when the fundamental truth failed to govern their thoughts and they proved themselves wrongful of actions
You people had better realize that whatever you have been granted of material advantages is simply the evanescent enjoyments of life and its temporal and mundane things, whereas all that is in heaven's realm affords eternal beatitude and surpassing pleasure. Have you people no sense
You people just think and think but this: Does he whom We promised Our efficacious grace and who found that it has effected the end for which it was given compare with him whom We graced with the material advantages of life here and then he finds himself among those indicted Hereafter
There shall come the Day when they have much to answer for. There and then shall Allah ask them "Where are My partners whom you incorporated with Me, whom you assumed they shared My divine nature
And there, those whose destiny as losers has been fulfilled shall say: "O Allah, our Creator", "it is these whom we led astray and caused to deviate in mind" "We caused them to deviate in purpose as we deviated in mind. We repudiate them and denounce them in Your August presence. In fact it was not us they really worshipped
And they -the followers- shall be told: "Call to your predominant partners, and they will, but no answer shall they receive therefrom and they shall all wish they had pursued the path of righteousness, the path of Allah
This is the Day when Allah shall call them in question and call them to render an account, thus: "What kind of response did you give to the Messengers
But all information and news shall be eclipsed to them and their lack in intellectual and spiritual perception shall reduce them to silence and repress any expression of feeling, that they admit no discourse
However, he who in lowliest plight repentant stood and acknowledged Allah's Supremacy, Omnipotence and Authority and whose deeds were impressed with wisdom and piety might be among those who succeed in inviting Allah's mercy and forgiveness
And Allah, your Creator, creates what He will and chooses what He will and whom He will whereas they -the infidels- and people at large cannot impose on Allah their choice in any matter irrespective of its nature and consequently they have no choice. Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely beyond all they incorporate with Him
And Allah, your Creator, is Omniscient indeed of all that is reposited in their bosoms of private thoughts and feelings and of all that they conceal and He is ALimun of all that they reveal
And He is Allah, there is no Ilah but Him. Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes here and Hereafter. To Him belong the rule, the government, the reign, the influence, the supreme authority, the decision and the indictment. Supremacy is His attribute and to Him shall all of you be brought back
Say to them O Muhammad: "What if Allah cancels -to your detriment- daylight and extends the night to the Day of Judgement!" "Who is the Ilah besides Him who will be able to restore for you daylight?" Will you people not deviate into sense and open your hearts' ears
Say to them: "What if Allah cancels the night and extends daylight to the Day of Judgement, who is the Allah besides Him who will be able to restore for you the night in which you repose! Will you not open your minds' eyes
But in mercy to you people He caused the night and the day to vary in duration and undergo constant alternation and successions* that you take your natural repose and recuperate** and be able to accomplish your objects sought after of His bounty to the end that your bosoms may hopefully surge forth and answer thanks
The Day shall come when He questions the infidels. He shall ask them: "Where are My partners whom you presumed they shared My divine nature and authority
And We will call to witness one from each nation (the Messenger) to give evidence in relation to the worldly matters and We will question the infidels- as to their proof of the validity of their gods whom they had incorporated with Allah! But they shall fail to advance any proof and they shall realize that Allah alone is and has always been the Truth personified. Here and now they are renounced and forsaken by those whom they presumed to share with Him His divine nature and supremacy; they have failed their expectations
Qarun was a Hebrew of the people of Mussa (possibly a cousin), one who exercised iniquity and injustice toward his people. We made all grace abound in him. We bestowed on him such immense treasures that the keys (of the chambers where the treasures were hidden) would have been an immense burden for a host of strong men to carry (were a burden for three hundred mules). His people said to him: "Do not rejoice boastingly, for Allah does not like those who boast` vaingloriously of what they are made to possess
And betake yourself", they added, "to Providence for the grace He made to abound in you seeking His satisfaction -to ensure spiritual relish- Hereafter, and do not neglect your share of worldly enjoyment of what is lawful, And be kindly disposed and benevolent to others as Allah has been to you and do not pursue mischief nor create discord on earth. Allah detests those who have ill- will and mischief is natural to them
But -Qarun- said: "I have acquired what came into my possession by reason of the knowledge inherent in me and for my intellectual acquaintance with fact". Did he not know that Allah had reduced to a useless form before him people who were stronger and greater in affluence! However, there is no need to question those who had been steeped in crime
And so he came out before his people in a splendid procession conducting himself pompously, and there exclaimed those who were absorbed m the vanities of this wicked world: "we wish", they said, "we were given the like of the riches Qarun was made to possess. He is indeed fortunate
Whereas those gifted with divine and spiritual knowledge exclaimed: "Woe betide you -people of vanities-","the reward conferred by Allah Hereafter is infinitely better for those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety, a status attained only by the patient who exercise forbearance under provocation, bear with others their faults and limitations and sit like patience on a monument smiling at grief
And to set him -Qarun- as a deterrent, We eclipsed him and his splendour, his wealth and his house in one swallow by the yawning earthly gulf We created by quaking the earth beneath him and his house and He had no supporters to defend him from Allah nor was he able to protect himself
And those who had desiderated his status the day before exclaimed then: "Goodness, it is evident that Allah gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously to whom He will of His servants and He gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will. Has He not been gracious and merciful to us". they added, "He would have made the earth take us into itself. Goodness, if is evident that those who challenge Allah do not really prosper
That home, in the world to come where one's true affections and hopes centre and where one finds peace, rest, refuge, beatitude and bliss, we simply reserve for those who do not seek to attain a high status in the land in order to impose themselves on people and to play the tyrant nor do they play the mischief or create discord. A happy ending is an attribute to those in whose hearts reigns piety
He who crowns the deed with equity shall be rewarded with what is infinitely better than what is commensurate with his deed and those who commit themselves to an evil line of conduct, shall be requited only with what is commensurate with their deeds
He Who imposed on you the Quran O Muhammad -which brought on you persecution and led you to go hence- shall cause you to return. Say to them: "Indeed Allah, my Creator, knows best who proclaims the spirit of truth that guides into all truth and who deviates from sense and be lest in the maze of error
You O Muhammad never expected the Book -the Quran- to be sent down and to be revealed to you but it was only Allah's mercy extended to you. Therefore, do not back up the infidels, who deny Allah, in a statement nor an opinion nor assist them physically or uphold them in any course of action
Nor let them succeed in obstructing your course of action nor cause you to deviate from Allah's system of faith and worship nor from His divine revelations after having been revealed to you. And exhort people by kind words to laudable conduct and invite their confidence and proceed to the path of righteousness, the path of Allah, and do not be attached to the infidels who incorporate with Allah other deities nor be Joined to them in sympathy or affection
Nor should you invoke with Allah other deities, there is no Ilah but Him. All created beings, the animate and the inanimate shall perish but not Him, the Creator of the whole and of all in all, Allah of countenance and Authority to whom belong the supremacy of the universe and to whom shall all of you be brought back
(Alef), L. (Lam), M. (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
Do people think that just because they express their thoughts in words and say: "In all things O Allah, our Creator, We do conform our will to Your blessed will" that they will be left untested
Indeed We tested those who came to this world before them and Allah shall most certainly know those who will prove true to their promises and their intentions as well as those who prove themselves liars
Or do those who consume their life in wrong-doing think they shall escape Our notice and consequently Our retributive punishment! How irrationally do they think and erroneously do they judge
He in whose breast hope springs eternal for meeting with Allah in Day of Judgement and who expects His mercy and blessings and dreads His retributive punishment must realize that that Day is indeed inevitable and He -Allah- is AL- Sami' (Omnipresent with unlimited audition), AL-Alim (Omniscient)
And he who strives in Allah's cause and makes His purpose the heart of his purpose-simply strives to save his own soul; Allah is indeed Ghaniyun (Absolute and Independent) of all His created beings
And those who imprinted their hearts with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety may expect Allah's mercy and blessings; We will cancel their evil deeds and blot out their sins from the books of life and We will requite them for every deed at the gauge of the best of what they accomplished
And We commended to man his parents to commit them to his kind care and to display to them a gentle and a kind disposition. Should they try to force you to adopt or accept polytheism and incorporate with Me other deities, then refuse to accept and disobey them (in this respect). To Me shall all of you return and I will inform you all of all that you did
And those who conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship and imprinted their hearts with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety shall be the recipients of Our mercy. We will admit them to the society of the virtuous who were characterized in life by justice and uprightness
Among people there is he who declares his belief in Allah. Yet when he is harmed in His cause he at once nurses despair and equalizes suffering here in magnitude and degree with the retributive punishment inflicted by Allah Hereafter. And should you Muslims be fortunate to be crowned with victory from Allah he proclaims he was in your array and a part of your troops. Does Allah not know what peoples' bosoms store of thoughts and feeling
And Allah does indeed know those who acknowledge His divine nature and His Omnipotence and Authority and conformed their will to His will and also He knows the hypocrites who falsely profess to be religiously inclined
And the infidels say to those who are true to Allah's system of faith and worship: "Follow our system of faith and worship and We will hold ourselves responsible for your sins and morally accountable for your actions, when in fact never shall they bear the wrongs of others, they are indeed pathological liars
Not only that, but they shall carry the burden of their wrongs and sinful actions added to the other burdens of those they tried to mislead and there is much indeed to answer for in Day of Judgement relative to their intentional assertion of what is false
We sent Nuh to his people among whom he sojourned for one thousand years less fifty and they were inundated and swept away by the flood, for they were steeped in wrongful actions
And We saved him and those on board ship who fell in line with him and we made it -the Ark- a sign of special meaning and import to all people, those of the past and the present and those to come
And Ibrahim when he said to his people: "worship Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, this shall be much better for you if only you knew
Those you worship besides Allah," he added, "are simply idols and this way you are indeed creating falsehood and discord. Those you worship besides Allah do not have the power to provide for you livelihood, therefore betake yourselves to Providence seeking His bounty for your livelihood and worship Him and impel to yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness to Him and do realize that to Him shall all of you return
And should you consider the message a picture of falsehood, many generations before you accused their Messengers of falsehood and you must realize that the duty of the Messenger is only to relate to the people all that has been sent down to him of divine revelations and the elucidation of their text
Did they -the infidels- not see how Allah creates and recreates. He starts creation and reproduces it, a process quite easy for him to perpetuate
Say to them -the pagans -"Journey the land and open your minds' eyes to see how he generated creation and it is Allah who shall originate the last creation -Resurrection. He is indeed Qadirun (Omnipotent) enough to accomplish all things
He punishes whom he will and extends mercy to whom He will and to Him shall all of you be sent back
Nor are you people in a position to over power Allah or frustrate Him on earth or in heaven nor escape his retributive punishment and besides Him you have no tutelary protectors to defend you against Him
And those who denied Allah's divine signs and rejected His divine revelations and the idea of the assemblage before Him in Day of Judgement shall have much to answer for. Such persons lack spiritual connection between their hearts and minds and Allah; they live without expectation of a spiritual desire and Allah alludes to them, thus": "These are they who have despaired of My mercy and shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned
And what was the answer of Ibrahim's people to his admonition and exhortation but to decide to get rid of him, they said: "Kill him or burn him" but Allah saved him and delivered him from the fire whole and all sound. This is indeed emblematic of Almightiness; food for thought that is taken by those who prostrate their reason to divine revelation
There and then said Ibrahim: "You people have dedicated your affectionate devotion in this world to idols besides Allah and in Day of Judgement shall all of you deny and reject each other and curse one another and be destined to make your eternal abode in Hell and there, no one can afford you help or protection
And it was only Lut who acknowledged him and accepted his message and said: "My heart, my mind and my soul as of now do quit the world of disbelief and emigrate to the world of truth and belief and as of now do I dedicate my affectionate devotion to Allah, my Creator, to Whom I betake myself, for He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
And We bestowed on Ibrahim Ishaq (Isaac) and Yaqub (Jacob) and conferred on his progeny the prerogative of Prophethood and We entrusted them with the Book and We graced him with his due here and among the virtuous he shall be Hereafter
And Lut whom We blessed, said to his people: "You people do commit such an immorality as is contrary to the general inherent character and moral constitution and a vice that has never been practiced by any creature before
You certainly have sensuous desire for men," he added, with whom you practice Sodomy and you commit highway robberies and you force people to immorality and in your society you commit abomination. And what was the response of his people. but to say: " we defy you to precipitate Allah's retributive punishment if indeed you are declaring the truth
And there, did Lut pray: " O Allah, my Creator afford me help and give me victory over these people who are steeped in mischief and in crime
And when Our Messengers -The angels- visited Ibrahim and intimated to him the joyful tidings (of the birth of a son in that advanced age) they said to him; "we will be reducing this town and its inhabitants to a useless form, they have been wrongful of actions
He -Ibrahim- said: "But among its inhabitants dwells Lut." They said: "we know exactly who lives there and we will deliver him and his family to safety excepting his wife who has been destined to remain behind -to meet with the same fate of the wicked
And when Our Messengers went to Lut he came to grief on their account, and their safety was beyond his power. But they assured him: "Do not be afraid," they said, "nor must you grieve, we will deliver you to safety along with your family but not your wife who shall join company with those destined to be left behind
We are bringing down from heaven, "they said, "upon the inhabitants of this town a torturing punishment with a forcible impact in requital of their wickedness and the evil way they conduct themselves in life
And We made of its relics an evident sign emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority appreciated by people who comprehend events with their senses especially with their minds' eyes
And to the Madyanites -of Madyan- We sent their brother Shuaib who said to them: "Worship Allah and follow His system of faith and worship and keep Him in mind and work for the Day of Judgement and entertain expectation of Allah's mercy and blessings and do not spread mischief on earth nor create discord
But they accused him of falsehood and in consequence they were seized by the destructive convulsion of the earth's surface which reduced them into a useless form and laid them prostrate and dead under the ruins of their demolished homes
Similarly ill-fated were the "'Aadites -of 'Aad- and the Thamudites –of Thamud-, and the remains of their decayed and fallen building and towns stand for you people as the living evidence of their fatal consequence. AL-Shaytan (Satan) allured them to brighter worlds and a happier destiny as a logical result or sequence to their doing and he led the way. He succeeded in blinding their eyes to the path of righteousness and led them by the nose to their loss in the maze of error, notwithstanding their intellect, for they were people who possessed enough intelligence
Similarly reacted Qarun, Pharaoh and his grand vizier Haman when Mussa was sent to them and presented them with clear and plain revelations and signs guiding out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment. But they displayed inordinate self-esteem and extravagance in their accounts of themselves. nevertheless, they did not escape Our notice and consequently Our retributive punishment
Each one of them did We penalize with what was commensurate with his evil deed. Among them were those against whom We sent a whirlwind and sand dunes and those who were overtaken by a merciless blast and those whom We eclipsed in one swallow by the yawning chasm We created beneath them and among them were those whom We drowned. And never was it Allah's attribute to do them injustice but it was they who wronged themselves
The like of those who take tutelary guardians or protectors besides Allah stands similitude exact of the spider which seeks protection in a house made of slender filaments or threads spun all round. It may be strong enough to suit its purpose, but it collapses by a wave of the hand, and so the spider's house is indeed the flimsiest of all houses if only they -the infidels- know
Indeed, Allah knows all things and He is Omniscient of everything animate or inanimate -the infidels- invoke besides Him. He is AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim (characterized by good sense and Prudence) (the Wise)
Such parables do We discourse to people -that they might hopefully ponder-. Such examples and illustrations are only grasped with the minds of those who know the facts and apprehend them with their senses
Allah created the heavens and the earth in conformity with fact and in agreement with reality and this is a meaningful sign impressive indeed to those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
Do recite O Muhammad all that has been revealed to you of the Book -the Quran- and establish worship and adore Allah, your Creator, with appropriate acts and rites, for sincere prayer checks abomination and immorality. To apply remembrance to Allah is more eminent in point of attainments and achievement, and Allah knows all that you do
And do not argue -O Muslims- with Ahl AL-Kitab (the people of the Book) but in a better fashion employing the faculty of reason in forming conclusions and adducing facts in a logical, peaceable and gracious manner, but not with those of them who are wrongful of actions lacking eloquence and fashion in their argumentation. Declare your thoughts in words, thus: "We do acknowledge all that has been revealed to us and to you. Our Ilah and your Ilah is One and to Him We bow to the ground in Islam and adoration
And just as We had revealed the Book to Messengers before you O Muhammad, We have revealed to you the Book -the Quran- which has been acknowledged by those among Ahl AL-Kitab who applied their minds to the acquisition of learning and thought intently and reflected. And this due recognition is shared by some of your people. And no one denies Our divine discourse and rejects Our revelations but the infidels who deny Allah
Had you been -O Muhammad- a learned man who read books before the Quran and were able to give expression to your feelings and your thoughts in writing and transcribe it with your right hand, this would have raised suspicion among those who take pleasure in the vanity of wickedness
But the Quran, is indeed a divine discourse expressing explicitly revelations easily intelligible in the hearts and minds of those who are well founded in knowledge and do-know the facts. And no one denies or rejects Our revelations but the wrongful of actions
And they -the infidels- say: "If only some convincing sign would be sent down to him from Allah, his Creator!". Say to them: "Allah has all sorts of divine signs evincing both His Omnipotence and Authority but I am only sent as a spectacle and a warning
Do they -the infidels- not consider it enough that We have sent down to you -O Muhammad- the Book -the Quran- to recite to them the truth that guides into all truth! This by itself evokes reminiscence of Allah's mercy and blessings and a reminder to a people who acknowledge His system of faith and worship
Say to them: "Enough is Allah to be a witness of our actions and your actions and to be the Judge. He is Omniscient of all that is in the heavens and of all that is on earth. And those who acknowledged falsehood and denied Him and His system of faith and worship shall be the losers
And they -the infidels- challenge you -O Muhammad- to hasten on the promised retributive punishment! Had it not been for a predetermined point of time set for their reckoning -to give a chance to repent- their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. But it shall overtake them unawares when least expected
They challenge you to hasten on the retributive punishment and they do not realize that Hell besets the infidels who deny Allah on all sides
The Day shall come when the torment laid upon the damned hangs over their heads and is carpeted under their feet. There and then, they are told: "Taste the fatal consequence of your deeds
O you My worshippers who conformed your will to My will: "My earth is, vast indeed -therefore you have no excuse-, worship Me and Me alone
Every soul shall pay its debt to nature and by consequence experience death and shall all of you be brought back to Us
Then those who imprinted their hearts with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety shall be the recipients of Our mercy and blessings. We will accommodate them in Paradise at mansions beneath which rivers flow wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity and this is the reward of those who worked for it
These are they who exercised patience and endured hardships and sat like patience on a monument smiling at grief and in Allah they put their trust
How many among Allah's created beings do not provide themselves with livelihood! Allah provides them with what is necessary for their sustenance as He does provision you -people- with victuals, eatables and drinkables, and He is AL-Sami' , and AL-Alim
And if you should ask them -O Muhammad- as to who has created the heavens and the earth and reduced the sun* and the moon to a state of subservience! They will say "Allah", and so how could they counsel deaf to the truth
Allah gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously on whom He will of His servants and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He Will. He is indeed Alimun of all things
And if you should ask them as to who sends water from the floor of the vault of heaven and revives the earth after it has suffered death,* they will say "Allah". Then say to them: "Thank Allah" -for admitting the truth-. They do not realize that they contradict themselves because most of them do not comprehend the facts
Life here is but an illusive and rapid change of feeling, fancy and thought and an amusement bringing happiness to those who cannot think. Whereas the Hereafter -which you should keep in mind and work for- is the life that is meaningful and significant, purposeful and blissful and above all eternal if only they knew
And when at sea on board ship and the wind is rising and the sea roughening they invoke Allah and Him exclusively. And when He extends mercy to them and delivers them to safety they simply incorporate with Him other deities
They do that in order to sink under the vexations of their Minds and deny all that Allah has given them. Let them enjoy themselves, it shall not be for long then they shall come to know the sad truth
Do they not see that We established a Sanctuary in their midst -in Macca-, where people feel safe and secure whereas all around them people are assaulted, abducted and kidnapped! Do they entertain vanity and falsehood and reject and dismiss the grace of Allah
And who is more wrongful of actions than he who viscously and cheaply relates to-Allah falsehood or dismisses the truth when it comes right to his door step! But is there not in Hell enough room to accommodate all those who deny Allah and reject His statutes
But those who strove in Our cause and served Our purpose shall be the recipients of Our mercy and blessings. We will guide them to Our paths and ways of righteousness and action and of thought and conduct. And, Allah upholds those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence
(Alef), L. (lam), M. (Meem) the Surah open with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
The Romans -Christians- have been defeated (by the Persians) - Atheists-, in the land near by - (the near end of the Roman Empire, Syria). but the tide of battle shall turn and following their defeat shall victory and fortune sit on their helm, in some few years from hence. to Allah alone. The Ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution in the beginning and the end, past, present and time to come; there and then shall the Muslims rejoice beyond a common joy for the victory of the Romans. Allah gives mastery and triumph to whom. He will and He is AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim (the Almighty and the Merciful). Tide of battle

The Ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution in the beginning and the end, past, present and time to come; there and then shall the Muslims rejoice beyond a common joy for the victory of the Romans.

Allah gives mastery and triumph to whom. He will and He is AL-Aziz and AL-Rahim (the Almighty and the Merciful)
Such is the promise of Allah Who never breaks His promise but most people fail to realize this fact
They -people- only look at things in life with respect to the aspect presenting itself to a slight or casual mental view and they are deceived by the smiling surface of the deep. They fail to take into account what the deep end affecting them profoundly is like. They are allured by the mundane, and oblivious of the Hereafter
Do they -people- not weigh matters mentally and think deeply that Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but in truth and for just ends for a predetermined point of time, notwithstanding that many among the people deny the assemblage before Allah, not to mention the Day of Judgement
Have they -the Meccans- not journeyed through the land and looked with their minds' eyes to see what was the end of those who preceded them, who wore far mightier and their diligence never wearied! They broke up the earth and turned over the soil and populated and peopled the land far more than these people have done! Their Messengers presented them with convincing divine signs and revelations -but they closed their, minds' eyes and counselled deaf-. Therefore it was not Allah Who would wrong them but it was they who wronged themselves
Then there came the evil end of those who perpetuated mischief and discord, moral depravity and the antithesis of good. They denied Allah's evident signs and His divine revelations and they mocked them and laughed them to scorn
Allah starts creation and reproduces it. He creates and recreates* and to Him shall all of you be sent back
And on the Day the Final Hour has come, the wicked shall despair of making an earnest supplication begging and imploring Allah's forgiveness
And none of their predominant partners can present himself or itself to intercede on their behalf nor interpose a veto upon Allah's decision. On the contrary, they -the guilty- shall themselves deny, curse and condemn those partners
So that the Day the Final Hour comes to pass shall all of them be segregated
Then those who conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship and imprinted their deeds with wisdom and piety shall be rejoicing beyond a common joy in the bliss and the beatitude of heaven's realm
But as for those who denied Allah and/or His system of faith and worship and dismissed the idea of assembling before Him Hereafter, they shall have much to answer for. They shall be overtaken by the torment laid upon the damned
Therefore, praise Allah and extoll His glorious attributes at the close of the day and when you rise in the morning
And to Him is addressed the grateful acknowledgement of benefits and favours in the heavens and on earth and when darkness prevails and when the day has climbed its peak of highest noon
He causes the living to issue Jorth from the dead and He causes the dead to fall from the living and He revives the earth after it has suffered death; similarly shall you be resurrected
And among His visible signs and His marvels displaying Omnipotence and Authority is that He brought you to being from dust by special creation and you evolved as human beings spreading throughout the earth in various directions
And among His marvels is that by a special creation did He evolve from you and of your own kind mates to form the complement to you as your counterparts in whom you seek consolation and find comfort, and between you both He implanted affection and mercy. These are tokens emblematic indeed of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority that are observed by people who ponder
And among his marvels is the creation* of the heavens and the earth* and the variation in your tongues when you express your thoughts in words and in your colour -the skin, the eyes and the hair-, marvels symbolizing Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, apprehended by those who know the facts
And among His marvels is the phenomenon of sleep* or the unconscious state, the condition regularly and naturally assumed by man and other created beings during the night and during the day to recuperate power and ability to accomplish objects which are sought after of His bounty; signs so significant as to impress those who open their hearts' ears
And among His marvels is that He exhibits to view lightening or the electrical discharges between groups of clouds and between the clouds and the ground -mountains- which actuate you with the feeling of fear -might bring you suffering, strike you dead or engender a cyclonic storm and with the feeling of hope- of rainfalls to revive the land which has been pined with drought- And from the floor of the vault of heaven He sends water reviving the earth after it had suffered death. All precepts concerning Allah's Omnipotence and Authority are in effect comprehended in these signs by those who exercise sound judgment and have the ability to perceive and adopt the best means for accomplishing an end and who are characterized by good sense and prudence
And among His marvels is the stability of the heavens and the earth and the precision* with which they perform at Allah's command (moons regions, spheres, celestial bodies galaxies and realms of space describing their orbits, each in its own path suspended in the immense expanse by the invisible force which you cannot see) This is besides the fact that when He summons you -people- to appear before Him for Judgement you emerge from the graves in response to His command
And to Allah belong all created beings* in the heavens and on earth, each and all being obedient and submissive to His will
And it is He Who begins creation and reproduce it and creates and recreates, a process that is indeed quite easy for Him to do -all it takes is "Be" and it is- Idealism, subjective and objective is exclusively an attribute of His, for nothing is like unto Him in the heavens and on earth, and He is the AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
Do you -people- have part- owners among those you have on hand, be they captives or reduced to a servile state who go shares with you in what We bestowed on you of affluence and stand with you on equal terms and you fear them as you fear yourselves - for injustice and temptation for ill-gotten gain! Then how could you relate to Allah partners of His created beings?. Thus do We expound Our revelations distinctly expressing all that they meant leaving nothing merely implied to those who exercise sound judgment and have the ability to perceive and adopt the best means for accomplishing an end
In effect the wrongful of actions have carried to excess their evil line of conduct by following their own wishes and by acting upon their own desires, a disposition reflecting ignorance and want of knowledge. Therefore, who can guide those whom Allah has justly destined to deviate from sense and miss the path of righteousness and who can afford them help
And so set your heart and thoughts O Muhammad upon the Faith and rest your eyes upon Allah with sincere feeling and actions and with firmness in fidelity and allegiance and in the fulfillment of all duties owed to Him. This is the natural instinct and the innate propensity Allah has implanted in mankind and no change ever shall there be nor should there be. This right and commendable religion is the only system of faith and worship that leads directly to Allah, but most people fail to realize this fact
Turn to Allah and have recourse to Him for guidance and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and engage in the act of worship and never be among those who incorporate with Him other deities
who divided their same religion -Polytheism- into various denominations, each forming a bigoted adherence of a sect and each holding certain views and rejoicing at its distinctive name and its own place of worship (some worship the Jinn, others the angels, others the priests, the rabbins, stones and trees, stars, planets, fire, day, night and kings)
And when people are touched or befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity they invoke Allah, their Creator, turning to Him exclusively and when He extends to them His mercy and delivers them from what was burdensome and exhaustive to the mind, some of them incorporate with Him other deities
They sink under the vexations of their minds and deny all that We have given them. You may enjoy yourselves, you people, it shall not be for long, then shall you come to know the sad truth
Or did We send down to them an authorization or someone with delegated authority to enforce polytheism and defend their course of action for incorporating with Allah other deities
And should We extend to people Our mercy and make them taste benediction they rejoice beyond a common joy and if they happen to meet with a misfortune as a result of what their wrongful and unclean hands have committed they nurse despair
Do they -the infidels- not see that Allah gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously on whom He will and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will. These divine actions are the best interpreters of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority that are apprehended by the senses of those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
Therefore, give your kindred what is benevolently due and be glad to do your benevolence to the needy and to the wayfarer specially the one who journeys on foot -due to lack or want of means-. This is better and advantageous indeed for those who wish to fulfill their obligation to Allah and to satisfy their conscience and their hearts
And whatever you invest of money expecting interest or profit by way of usury to appropriate people's property wrongfully to yourselves is an ill- gotten gain which shall never yield an increment with Allah nor shall it ever grow with Him, like benevolence does and excessively. Whereas what you invest in charity or benevolence as an obligation to Allah and to satisfy your conscience shall Allah increase immeasurably and such persons are those to whom what is saved with Allah shall be redoubled to their credit
Allah is He Who brought you to being and caused you to exist and provisioned you with livelihood. He then deprives you of animate existence and at a predetermined point of time He shall resurrect you. Is there any among your predominant partners who is able to do that! Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes, He is infinitely beyond those you incorporate with Him
Evil is wrought by want of thought; there has come about the age of mischief and discord on land and at sea as a result of what the peoples' wrongful and unclean hands have committed. Allah shall make them taste and suffer the consequence that they might hopefully turn to Him in repentance
Say to them: "Journey through the land and use your minds' eyes to see what was the end of those who came to this world before you; most of them were polytheists who incorporated with Allah other deities
And set your face and your thoughts O Muhammad upon Allah and set your eyes and your heart sincerely upon His system of faith and worship, the right, the correct and the true religious system that is in accordance with what is authoritatively established. Be a firm adherent thereto, before the inevitable Day which no one can avert nor will it be revoked by Allah. This shall be the Day when they -these people and all people- shall be separated from each other and divided into aggregates of like persons
And he who denies Allah's system of faith and worship or incorporates with Him other deities shall find that the consequence of his infidelity rebounds back on him. And those who imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety, simply pave the way for a blissful abode in the beatitude of heaven, Allah willing
For He rewards those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety, in contrast to the infidels whom He simply detests
And among His marvels is that He sends forth the winds as a forerunner heralding a joyful event -rain and the propulsion by its action upon the sails- And the ships move on the surface of the water by His invisible acting force which produces their buoyancy and their motion, to accomplish your objects sought after of His bounty to the end that your bosoms may hopefully surge forth and answer thanks
And before you. O Muhammad We sent Messengers conveying Our divine message to their people. They presented them with clear and plain revelations guiding out of darkness and superstitions of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment -but they counselled deaf and closed their hearts' ears-. And by consequence We avenged our right by inflicting retributive punishment upon those who were steeped in crime. At the same time it was incumbent on Us to save and deliver to safety those whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues
It is Allah Who sends the winds -carrying water vapour extracted* chiefly from the water mass on the surface of the earth- to raise clouds He spreads in the floor of the vault of heaven as He wills. Then He makes a cumulus or rounded masses heaped upon each other like towers or mountains where you see the rain drops issuing from within; And when He makes it light upon whom He wills of His servants they rejoice beyond a common joy
Albeit before it rained they had lost hope and nursed despair
Therefore, look with your minds' eyes into the effect of Allah's mercy when extended to the people how He revives the land after it had suffered death! And it is He who shall bring the dead back to life, for He is indeed Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things
And should We send a wind drying up moisture and depriving plants and fruits of their natural colour making it turn yellow, they would be actuated with the feeling of ingratitude and ungratefulness and turn renegades
And so, you just shall not be able O Muhammad to make your voice reach the spiritually dead nor shall you be able to make it reach the worthless who counsel deaf and do not open their hearts' ears when they turn their backs
Nor shall you be able to guide those who lack intellectual or spiritual perception and their minds' eyes are blind nor can you extricate them or disengage out of the entangled wood of error. You will be audible only to those who acknowledge Our signs and Our divine revelations betokening Omnipotence and Authority and they have conformed to Islam
Allah is He Who created you and delivered you over to this world in a stage of utter weakness then from weakness to strength He evolved you, then He reversed the stage of strength to a stage of weakness and gray hair. He creates and evolves what He will and He is AL-Alim (the Omniscient), AL-Qadir (the Omnipotent)
And the Day when the Final Hour has come to pass, the wicked steeped in crime shall swear they only reposed for an hour. And just as they shall make the wrong estimate of time, similarly they will have done in life, they wrongly estimate the truth and they favour declination from religion
But those to whose minds was imparted divine and spiritual knowledge and in whose bosoms was implanted faith as a conviction operative on their character and will, shall express the true estimate of time, thus: "But," they say to the infidels, "you were reposed in the grave as is registered in the archetypal Book of Allah till the Day of Resurrection and this is it, the promised Day which you did not realize was the truth personified
There and then no excuse shall be accepted from the wrongful of actions nor shall they be reproved nor be graced now by repentance
We have quoted in this Quran examples of typical instances that form particular cases of principle, rule and state of things, examples illustrating qualities and signal instances of punishment, action or conduct inducing imitation, examples discoursed in parables of persons whose fate serves as a deterrent., Yet if you should present them with divine signs emblematic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, the infidels label them fictitious, worthless and vain
Thus does Allah imprint an objectionable disposition on the hearts of those who do not realize the object of thought nor do they bring it vividly and clearly before their minds
Therefore, be patient O Muhammad and be unwearied in the face of difficulties and hindrances, and quietly await the course of events; the promise of Allah is the truth personified. Let not their disdainful attitude and their unsettled allegiance and belief influence your firm mind and your firm thoughts nor should you let them disturb or discompose your peace of mind
(Alef), L. (Lam), M. (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
These are divine revelations presented in the Book -the Quran-, the fountain- head of wisdom
The Book symbolizing the spirit of truth guiding into ail truth and to the best way of moral rightness which has had everlasting residence in the character of the Godhead and to the uprightness of decision. And it is a guide to the heart and the conduct and to the best way of life besides being a mercy to those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety
Who observe their act of worship, give Zakat (alms) -for alms are but the vehicles of prayer- and they are inspired with the certainty of the Hereafter which imbues their inmost being
Such persons are on the path of righteousness and Providence there guide and these are they who shall reap the fruits of victory here and hereafter
And among people is he who indulges in vain talk; his malice, being motivated in some satisfying way centers on misleading people from the path of Allah and on inciting them to deviate from sense in ignorance and want of divine knowledge; he makes the issue the object of ridicule. Such persons shall suffer the humiliating torment laid upon the damned
And when Our revelations are recited to him he simply withdraws and turns away in inordinate self-esteem as if he heard nothing divine as though he lacks intellect or he is defective in the sense of hearing. Tell him, O Muhammad and the like of him to expect a severe punishment
But those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds, wisdom and piety shall be rewarded with the blissful abode in the beautitude of the realm of heaven
wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity as promised by Allah Whose promise is the truth personified. He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL- Hakim (the Source of Wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
He is it Who created the heavens and raised them with their spheres lying above or outside of each other inlaid with heavenly bodies superstructures kept aloft without pillars or visible means of support that you -people- can see.* He furnished the earth with firm stays, -mountains- placed in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, to stabilize** it lest it should sway you from side to side or in all directions. And He scattered over it animate beings of all sorts. And We send down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water instrumental in vegetal growth in pairs of like things emerging in varying colours with good qualities and of great advantages
This is what Allah has brought into being and caused to exist. And now show me -you infidels- what have those you revered besides Him created, and brought into being! The fact is that the wrongful of actions are lost in the maze of error
We imparted to Loqman* wisdom and the capacity of judging rightly in matters relating to life and conduct and to the soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends. And We exhorted him to impel himself to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness, for he whose bosom surge forth and answers thanks, serves his own soul. He who denies Allah's favours must realize that Allah is Ghaniyun (Absolute and Independent) and Hamidun (worthy of all praise)
In exhorting his son Loqman said: "O my son, never Incorporate with Allah other deities, for polytheism is a grave offense and an unforgivable sin indeed
We commended to man his parents to commit them to his kind care -and to display to them a gentle and a kind disposition- With travail does his mother bear him in her womb and she spends two years (in suckling him) before he is weaned. And We exhorted him, thus: "Impel yourself O man to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness to Me and to your parents, for in the end to Me shall be the destination
And should they try to force you to adopt or accept polytheism and to incorporate with Me other deities of whom or (of which) you have empty knowledge, then refuse to accept and disobey them in this respect". "But keep friends with them in life and maintain the friendly feeling and disposition and let it be felt in equity". "And tread the path of those who turn to Allah and in Him they trust, and in the end, to Me shall all of you return when I will inform you of all that you did
My son", he said, "you must realize that everything material or immaterial as light or as little as a mustard seed be it inside a rock or in the heavens or on earth shall Allah bring it to light, Allah is Latifun (Gracious). He gives His servants an understanding, heart and He is Khabirun (Omniscient)
My son", he added, " observe the act of worship and enjoin equity, forbid what is wrong, odious and abominable and exercise patience with composure when exposed to a misfortune or wedded to a calamity, for this reflects an attitude of mind that mirrors high spirit and strong will
And do not", he continued, "give cheek to people nor inflate it with pride and vanity nor should you walk on earth displaying inordinate self-esteem or with an overweening opinion of your qualities, attainments or estate". "And do realize that Allah detests every boastful who exalts himself and displays inordinate self-esteem
And walk forth" he said, " with moderate steps and with regular pace comformable to a standard recognized as formally correct". "And .lower your voice when you give utterance or expression to an emotion, opinion, feeling, thought, or discussion and in your natural action, for the most repulsive, objectionable and displeasing sound produced by the vocal organs is the braying or the loud harsh sound of asses
Do you people not see that Allah has subjected to you the heavens and the earth and reduced them to a state of subservience to your advantage and He made all grace abound in you, the seen or unseen! Yet among people are those who argue about Allah in ignorance and for want of thought, want of guidance and by want of a Book imparting divine knowledge wisdom and spiritual light
And when exhorted to tread the path of Allah and to recognize what He has revealed and accept it with consenting mind, they defiantly say: "We only lean on the particular system of faith and worship our fathers were bent on". A great pity, even if AL-Shaytan is leading them by the nose to the gates of Hell wherein they suffer the torment laid upon the damned
And he who sets a good face upon Allah and sets his heart to serve His purpose with deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety will have grasped firmly at the eternal, the unchangeable and the most secure handhold which never separates nor does it suffer a break. And to Allah, the Ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and Hereafter
And he who denies Allah O Muhammad and disobeys His statutes shall have much to answer for; let not his infidelity affect you with grief and deep sorrow. To Us shall they return when We inform them of all that they had done and/or left undone. Allah is indeed 'Alimun (Omniscient) of all private thoughts and feelings that are reposited in the bosoms
We will satisfy their needs and their desires and make them hold and enjoy the same for a little while and up to a predetermined point of time then We will compel them to pay the heavy price manifested in the unmerciful and unrelenting torment laid upon the damned
And if you should ask them O Muhammad as to who has created the heavens and the earth? They will say: "Allah". Then say to them: "Praise be to Him to Whom praises precede and thanks succeed". Never doubt but most of them have empty knowledge
To Allah belong all that is in heaven and all that is on earth the animate and the inanimate and He is AL-Ghaniy (the Independent), The Absolute. His grace abounds in the universe and AL-Hamid (the Worthy of all praise)
If the wood of all the trees growing on earth were to be manufactured into pens added to every other material having the function of a writing pen, and the vast body of water on the surface of the earth and seven times as much were ink serving the purpose of committing Allah's words to writing, never would Allah's words be exhausted; Allah is indeed Azizun and Hakimun (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
You –people- must realize that your creation or the process of bringing you into being and the process of recreating you or bringing you back to life at Resurrection en mass entails no more than the creation of one single soul involves! Allah is Sami'un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition), and Bassirun (He keeps a vigilant eye upon the whole and upon all in all)
Do you not see that Allah causes the night to lose its character and identity by absorption into the day and causes the day to lose its character and identity by absorption into the night and that He reduced the sun and the moon to a state of subservience,* each describing its orbit for a determined period of time and that He is 'Alimun
This is to implement the absolute fact that Allah is the absolute truth and all that they invoke besides Him is falsehood personified and that Allah is AL- 'Aliye (the Supreme) and AL-Kabir (the Paramount)
Do you not see that the ships move on the surface of the waters -seas and rivers- by His bounteous invisible acting force producing their buoyancy and their motions; a process indicative indeed of His grace and the marvels He exhibits to you! In these divine signs there is enough food for thought to those who exercise patience and impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
And when they-people at large-are overwhelmed at sea with waves rising in billows they invoke Allah for mercy and they invoke Him exclusively. And when He saves them and delivers them to safety, then only some of them do keep their promise and begin to adopt an honest and godly course of life and eventually lift to Him their inward sight. And no one denies Our divine signs and favours ignoring Our revelations but the one who professes friendship in order to betray, mislead, deceive or seduce others and disappoint their hopes and expectations and impels himself to the feeling of ingratitude and ungratefulness
O you people: "Keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and regard with fear a Day when no father can avail his son nor be of advantage to him or be able to afford him help nor can a son avail his father or be of profit to him, and do realize that Allah's promise is Truth personified. Therefore, do not let life below deceive you and entangle you with the fleshy passions and mundane vanity nor should anything power, business, wealth, knowledge, long life, status, lust, or AL-Shytan or those with characteristics befitting him ever alienate you from Allah
Allah keeps to Himself and in His hand rests the knowledge of the predetermined moment of the Final Hour. He causes the condensed water vapour in the atmosphere to fall down in rain drops from the floor of the vault of heaven as He will. He knows what is in the wombs of humans and animals, of the earth, of the depth of the night, of fortune and of any hidden cavity. No soul knows what it will earn; material or immaterial on the morrow and no soul knows where it is destined to come upon the encounter with death. Allah is indeed 'Alimun and Khabirun (intimately acquainted with all things.) see Introduction
(Alef), L. (lam), M. (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
This Book -the Quran- has without doubt proceeded from Allah and has been intimated by Him, the Creator of the Worlds, the visible and the invisible, pasts, present and those to come
Or do they -the infidels- say: "He -Muhammad- has forged it and related it to Allah! " But it is indeed the truth revealed by Allah to you O Muhammad to exhort a people who never received a Messenger before you serving as a spectacle and a warning that they might hopefully be deviated into sense and be guided into all truth
Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and all that lies in the space between in six days* determined by His own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar. He then set Himself on the Throne of dominion, grace and mercy. Besides Him you have no tutelary guardian nor an intercessor; can you people not reflect
He conducts all affairs and all matters of His created beings from the heavens above down to the earth below and the process bounds back to Him over a period of a day, determined by His own unit of time, amounting to one thousand years of those you -people- count according to your earthly calendar
And so this is Allah, your Creator, the Omniscient of the invisible, the hidden and the unseen and the Omniscient of what the bosoms store of thoughts and feelings and of what they forge. This is Allah Who has cognizance and holds prescience of what you converse secretly and utter below your breath and of what you suggest secretly to the mind. And He is well acquainted with the visible and the seen, AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Rahim (the Merciful)
Who just perfected everything He created and brought into being and He started the material part of man from clay
And He made his posterity emerge from a lineage of a contemptible watery fluid
Then He fashioned him and imparted to him the shape of man and inspirited him by special divine actuation emanating from His own spirit. And He provided you - People- with faculties divine: The faculty of hearing and that of sight and insight and with the seats of feeling, understanding and thought, yet how little do you show gratitude
And they -the infidels- say: "Do you mean that after we are lost in the dust and absorbed by the earth we will be resurrected anew and brought back to life! The fact is that not only do they deny their assemblage before Allah for Judgement but also all it entails
Say to them O Muhammad: "When time is due to pay nature's debt, then the angel of death who has been assigned to you disembodies your souls and there, you will be sent back to Allah, your Creator
And if only you Muhammad could envisage the wicked when they are up standing before Allah in Day of Judgement drooping their heads, incensed with multiple wrongs and humiliations, imploring His mercy and expressing their thoughts in words: "Now O Allah, our Creator, we can see what our minds' eyes failed to see and we hear what our hearts' ears failed to hear" "Would You send us back to make up for what we neglected and to imprint our deeds with wisdom and piety. We are now convinced that what the Messengers presented to us was indeed the truth
Had we willed We would have inspired every soul with piety and actuated each and all with the feeling sense of gratitude for Our favours but (knowing beforehand that most of the people -Jinn and mankind- shall counsel deaf to the truth) the decree has been already set forth by Me to fill Hell with both the Jinn and mankind all together
There and then shall they be told: "Now you taste the fatal consequence of neglecting the encounter with this Day, and in return We have also neglected you; now you taste the eternal torment that is laid upon the damned for committing yourselves to actions contrary to what was dictated to you by Allah's revelations
Those who faithfully hug Our revelation to their hearts are only those who fall prostrate to Allah forthwith they are exhorted thereby and/or reminded thereof and they celebrate the praises of Allah, their Creator, and extol His glorious attributes and their prudence gets the better of their pride
Their sides desert the beds for nocturnal devotion in exchange for Allah's mercy and blessings: They prostrate their reason to divine revelation and they make invocation unto Him by comely prostration of their bodies, which act reflects dread that is mingled with veneration and reflects hope that springs eternal in their bosoms for His pitiful forbearance toward them, and they spend in benevolence of Our grace that was made to abound in them
No soul knows what Allah has in store for it and for the like of it of rewards that shall be viewed with pleasure and with eyes speaking content in requital of what they achieved and attained, fulfilled and completed, perfected and accomplished
Would he whose heart reflects the image of religious and spiritual virtues be equaled to the one in whose heart reign vice and impiety
But those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety must expect the Gardens of bliss in which they shall be homed with home-felt delight wherein each one shall come into close relation with oneself and with others in requital of all the good they had accomplished in life
Those in whose hearts reigns vice shall be homed in Hell. As often as they try to escape it they are reinstated therein and shall be told: "Now you taste the torment experienced in Hell which you had always denied
And in mercy to them We will make them suffer here the lesser of the two evils by justly submitting them to pain and punishment that they might hopefully repent and turn to Allah and save themselves the bigger and really vehement, punishment Hereafter
And who is more wrongful of actions than he who is reminded of Allah's evident signs and revelations and he shuns and persistently avoids them and abstains from listening to them! Let them just wait, We will take just vengeance on them and afflict them with the torment laid upon the damned
We entrusted M?ssa (Moses) with the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah), therefore do not let the Israelites course of action toward you O Muhammad give you an occasion to uncertainty. M?ssa received AL-Tawrah, the Spirit of truth, which was meant to guide Bani-Israel (the Children of Israel) Into all truth
And based on this divine discourse which M?ssa imparted to them We ordained some of them religious leaders and authorities on matters of the law and the doctrine as well as other solemn observances. And We authorized this course after they had exercised patience and forbearance under provocation and bore with others their limitations and after they had hugged Our revelations to their hearts
Therefore, wait O Muhammad; Allah, your Creator, shall in Day of Judgement, decide the question pertaining to every Messenger and his own people and to the matters in difference
Do they not perceive mentally and by sight the significance of Allah's penalties! and have they failed to realize how many generations before them did We reduce into a useless form! They tread their dwellings they once occupied and they see with their own eyes the consequence of disobeying Allah. Indeed, such an outcome is emblematic of Allah's signs recognized by people of insight. Are they deaf or have their hearts' ears been closed
Do they not see that We drive the rain water and water from other sources to the barren land and thereby We stir* it to activity, causing the growth of all sorts of vegetation serving as alimentation for their cattle and for themselves! Can they not apprehend with their sight or with their minds' eyes
And they -the infidels- insolently challenge you O Muhammad to overcome them, asking: "On what day do you expect victory to sit on your helm if you are declaring the truth
Say to them O Muhammad: " on the day of victory of those who conformed to Islam the infidels shall not profit by pleading submission to Allah in the now nor shall their punishment be put in respite
Therefore, disregard them O Muhammad and wait for the timely, justice that is being prepared above in heaven's realm and they shall also be waiting -either mockingly or in order to be prepared for your next move
O you the Prophet: "Entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and do not obey the infidels nor the hypocrites nor be influenced by their views or notions, Allah is indeed 'Alimun (Omniscient), and Hakimun (He is the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
And act upon and in accordance with what is being inspired to you from Allah, your Creator. He is indeed 'Alimun of all that you people do
And put your trust in Allah, and enough is He to be your tutelary Guardian Who exercises protecting vigilance over you
Never did Allah provide a man with two hearts within his body nor did He make your wives whom you divorce by the diction "mother's back" your mothers, nor did He ordain that your adopted sons be designated as your sons. This is your story and the allegation to which you give tongue whereas Allah declares the truth as guides you thereto
Relate them to their fathers. This is a recourse sanctioned by Allah and if you do not know their fathers nor can you trace them, then they are members of your brotherhood and your co-religionists. You are absolved of what you erroneously did in the past but not of what you resolved where the guilt resided in the intention, but Allah has always been Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
The Prophet is more closely attached to those who conformed to Islam than they are to themselves and his wives are their mothers. Those of you who are related by blood or by descent from a common ancestor take precedence of those who conformed to Islam and of those who emigrated in inheriting each other as is decreed in Allah's Book unless it be a favour you are doing to those who are unrelated or an edict that has been set forth by Allah in writing and be this so in the Quran
We entered into a covenant with each of the prophets of the past to fulfill the duty entrusted to them by Allah just as We entered into a covenant with you and with Nuh (Noah), with Ibrahim (Abraham) and with Mussa (Moses) and with 'Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), and We bound them to a solemn and serious covenant
So that He questions in Day of Judgement the men of truth the Prophets, who were entrusted with His message and their peoples' response! Meantime He has put in readiness for the infidels a punishment which shall vex them with great physical and mental suffering
O you people who have conformed to Islam. Recall your memory with the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness for the grace of Allah which was made to abound in you. You were confronted with and surrounded by the thickest troops of your enemies* and We sent against them a fierce wind. while camping around the trench, as well as invisible forces you did not see. Allah has Always been Bassirun and He keeps a vigilant eye upon everything and He sees all things
They -the enemy forces- came to you from the north and from the south and from high ground and low ground wherefore your eyes grew dim and beclouded and the hearts sank in the shoes and throbbed and leaped high into the mouths and you began to be suspicious of Allah and to have an evil presage in your minds and bloody thoughts of Him
There and in that extreme situation were those who conformed to Islam tested. Their actions, their thoughts and their disposition mirrored their spirit-high or low and their will -poor or strong- in the face of the extreme danger which really shook them and quaked them with fear
And there, said the hypocrites and those whose hearts reflected the morbidity inherent in their innermost being: "What do you say to this! Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but deception and delusion
And some of them advised people of the city Yathrib to defect. They said to them: "O you people of Yathrib this is not the place for you, you just go back to your homes". Another party asked the Prophet's permission if they could be excused! They said to him: "Our homes are exposed and defenseless when in fact they were not and were guarded by other Muslims but in truth they wanted to fly away and take to their heels
And had the situation been reversed and the forces laid siege on the city and moved into it upon possession and they -the hypocrites- were incited to turn renegades and fight to their -the enemy's side- against the Muslims they would have done it before long. (these were the men* who were forgiven and had promised never to behave this way again)
Yet they had already given their solemn promise to Allah never to defect, desert or flee the enemy. They failed to realize that an engagement entered into with Allah is indeed an immense responsibility
Say to them O Muhammad: "Neither defection nor desertion shall avail you if you should flee the enemy to escape death or massacre if your hereafter is meant to be planted in the now. Life is too short and its enjoyment is short-lived
Say to them: "Who can defend you against Allah or protect you from Him should He decide to befall you with a misfortune or wed you to a calamity or obstruct His mercy if He decides to extend it to you". Such people will not find a tutelary guardian nor someone to afford them help
Indeed Allah knows the dissuaders among you and He knows those who exhort their associates and fellows-in-arms against fighting and say to them: "Come to us" "and desert these fighting men". And they themselves hardly join the Muslim forces in combat
They are liberal in promises, stingy in performance, in offering help and in financial aid. When fear and dread overwhelm you see them look at you with a countenance speaking a different language; their eyes roll and turn round in their sockets like someone about to faint or on whom death is casting its shadow. Yet no sooner dread be dispelled than they call you everything they can lay their tongues to and give you a lick with the rough sides of their tongues, being stingy in benefaction and benediction. Such persons did not really conform to Allah's system of faith and worship and by consequence did He destine them to be losers whose hopes are doomed to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness, and nothing is easier for Allah to do
They -these hypocrites- think that the confederates have not yet lifted the seige nor have they withdrawn. And should the confederates lay seige again (to Madina). they will wish they were wandering among the Bedouins in the desert and then they will learn of your news and events while at a safe distance. Had these people been among you in combat they would not have engaged in fighting but a little
You people have always had an exemplar of the Messenger of Allah who displays a good quality as well as a magnificent attribute of a great master whose conduct induces imitation by the one in whose bosom hope springs eternal of Allah's mercy and of the bliss of the hereafter and applies remembrance to Allah often enough
(In contrast to the attitude of the hypocrites) the manner of acting of the faithful was representative of their feeling. When they saw the forces of the confederates they immediately exclaimed: "This is the promise made to us by Allah and His Messenger" -labour, effort and endurance shall accomplish victory- and the promise of Allah and His Messenger is truth personified, an inspiration actuating them with the feeling of confidence and obedience and made them present a bold front
Among the faithful whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues are those who were true to their covenant with Allah. Some of them have fulfilled their promise and acquired the glorious privilege of a martyr, others can hardly wait to receive this honour and never did they change their minds' direction nor their will toward the end and they ascertained their disposition
Allah justly rewards the faithful with what is commensurate with their conduct which is in accordance with divine standard and He justly punishes the hypocrites if He will or forgives and absolves them from His debt if He will for Allah has always been Ghafurun and Rahimun
And Allah drove back the infidels, in the rage of their distemper, who failed to accomplish their intended end and Allah spared the votaries the fighting and averted the imminent disaster. Allah has always been Qwiyun (Omnipotent) and Azizun (Almighty)
And He disengaged those of Ahl AL-Kitab (the People of the Book), who sided with the confederates, from their strongholds and inspired terror to their hearts to the end that you -Muslims- were able to kill some and hold others in confinement
And He made you inherit their lands, their homes and their wealth as well as a land where you never set foot. And Allah has always been Qadirun (Omnipotent) enough to accomplish all things as He will and whenever He will
O you the prophet, say to your wives: "If you are interested in life here and in its mundane splendour then come I will fit you out with what is necessary for your enjoyment and your indemnity and set you free gracefully
But if you are seeking to draw near to Allah and to His Messenger and the Hereafter be your aim, then you must know that Allah has prepared for the virtuous among you an imposing reward
O you the wives of the Prophet: Should any of you commit herself to an evil line of conduct and/or be guilty of proven violation of the marriage bed then in two ways shall her punishment be doubled here and Hereafter and nothing is easier for Allah to do
And any of you who conforms her will to Allah's will and to that of His Messenger and devotes herself to serving Allah's purpose and imprints her deeds with wisdom and piety shall be the recipient of His mercy and blessings. We will reward her with twice as much of what is commensurate with her deeds and a gracefully blessed provision will have been prepared for her
O you the wives of the Prophet: You must realize that you are not like any of the other women in privileges, dignity, state and all other aspects. If indeed you do entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah then you must not be disposed in your discourse, to accommodate yourselves to the rest nor care to please so that you guard yourselves from being supposed by the one whose heart reflects the morbidity inherent in his innermost being. Show discernment in the guidance of your discourse* and let it reflect equity and justice
And stay at home and if you have to go out for a necessity do not expose the physical parts affording keen pleasure to the senses nor be clothed with what beautifies, nor display your charm, a picture that was habitually seen in former times of ignorance and paganism. And observe the act of worship and give Zaket (alms). for alms are but the vehicles of prayer and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah intends to protect you from enormity and its consequences and keep it away from you the Prophetic household and to rid you of and to cleanse you from moral and spiritual defilement
And recall to memory what is recited to you of Allah's divine revelations and of wisdom and wise dispensations of Providence. Allah has always been Latifun (gracious), He gives His servants an understanding heart and Khabirun (Omniscient)
Those of the men and the women who conformed to Islam and the men and the women whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and the men and the women who exercise unqualified obedience to Allah, and the men and the women who are true to Allah and have brought themselves up in the obedience of His statutes, and the men and the women who exercise patience and forbearance under provocation and bear with others their limitation, and the men and the women who are humble and their prudence gets the better of their pride, and the men and the women who have a charitable feeling toward mankind and a disposition to benevolence, and the men and the women who fast or abstain from food (at the specified time) as a religious observance and fast from sin and from abomination, and the men and the women who guard their sexual morality and refrain from unlawful sexual congress, sex perversion and sex abuse, and the men and the women who constantly apply remembrance to Allah are those who shall indeed win Allah's mercy. He has intended to grant them forgiveness and has prepared for them a great reward
(And let it be clearly understood) that: No man or a woman whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues be in a position to exercise choice when once Allah and his Messenger have decided on a course of action, pronounced a Judgement or brought a cause to a decision. And he who disobeys Allah and His Messenger will have deviated from sense and will have cast himself head-long in the maze of error
And you say to the man to whom Allah has been gracious and whom He guided to His System of faith and worship and you were kind to him and you adopted him as your son:" "Hold your hand and hold on to your wife and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah." And you hide in your heart what Allah would inevitably bring to light and make known and you fear the people when it is only Allah Whom you should really fear. (However) when Zaid gained his end of dissolving his marriage and the prescribed period of waiting was fulfilled. We arranged your matrimonial union with her. so that those who conformed to Islam would not feel they shall stand at the mark of criticism should they be willing to marry the women who were once married to their adopted sons who have attained their object of divorce and the formalities have been fulfilled. Allah's command must be fulfilled
The Prophet incurs no blame nor does he stand at the mark of criticism when he carries into effect an edict issued by Allah; a mode of action Allah had pursued with the prophets of old. And Allah's edict has always been determinable, authoritatively decided and definitely ascertained
Those were the Prophets entrusted with Allah's divine message which they related to the people and they regarded Allah with reverence and awe and they feared no one but Him, and enough is Allah to call people to account here and Hereafter
Muhammad is not the father of anyone of your men so that He be prohibited to carry into effect Allah's edict but he is Allah's Messenger and the ultimate and a seal of the Prophets, and Allah has always been 'Alimun of all in all
O you who have conformed to Islam, apply remembrance to Allah as often as you can
And praise Him and extol His glorious attributes at the beginning and the close of the day
It is He Who extends to you His mercy as do His angels so that He guides you out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment. He has always been Rahimun to those in whose hearts reigns piety
The Day they -these people of piety- assemble before Him in Day of Judgement shall they be greeted with the expression of good will "Peace", and Allah will have prepared for them gracefully blessed provisions
O you the Prophet: We have sent you, to the people to be a witness lo their response to the divine message and a spectacle and a warning and a herald of joyful tidings
And to present to them inducements helping them shake off falsehood and be attracted to Allah and by His permission conform to His system of faith and worship, and that you stand among them as a source of spiritual light from whom emanates illumination and enlightenment
And be sure to announce joyful tidings to those who faithfully conform to Allah's system of faith and worship to expect the great bounty of Providence. It includes the divine influence operating in men to regenerate and sanctify and imparts strength to endure trial and resist temptation
And do not obey the infidels nor the hypocrites nor be influenced by their views or notions and pay no attention to their insults and annoyances and put your trust in Allah and enough is He to be your tutelary Guardian Who exercises protecting vigilance over you
O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: if you have been married to women of the same law and you divorce them before you have consummated marriage then you have no claim upon them to fulfill the prescribed set period of waiting and set them free gracefully
O you the Prophet: We have ratified and confirmed by sanction and solemn enactment your wives whom you have dowered as well as those on hand -the prisoners of war- whom Allah has made assignable to you. Also lawful to you are the daughters of your paternal uncles and aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and aunts who emigrated with you in addition to any woman of the same law who dedicates herself to the Prophet and the Prophet wishes to be bound to her in wedlock. This is a privilege that is granted to you exclusively and not to the Muslims at large. We know what We have promulgated and legislated for them concerning their wives and those on hand so that you do not feel that you stand at the mark of criticism and Allah has always been Ghafurun and Rahimun
You incur no blame should you defer the turn of whom you will and bring over to your side whom you will and whom you choose of those whose turn you have deferred. This will make them happy and their eyes will speak content and they will not grieve at heart, they will all be satisfied with what you have accorded them and Allah knows what is in your hearts and in your minds. Allah has always been 'Alimun and Halimun (Forbearing toward His creatures)
(And as of now) You are not permitted O Muhammad to unite in wedlock with more women nor are you permitted to change those you have for other wives even if their beauty attracts your eyes and captivates your heart except those you have on hand. And Allah, has always been Raqibun keeping a vigilant eye upon all things
O you who have conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship: Do not enter the Prophet's houses unless you are permitted to do so for a meal, in which case you do not sit waiting for the food until it be ready. But if you are invited then you enter not too early but at the time expected and when you have dined then be excused and do realize that dispersion then is a necessary circumstance to be fulfilled. And do not linger to engage in a sociable discourse, for such behaviour has always caused inconvenience to the Prophet who is ashamed to ask you to leave, but Allah is not ashamed of declaring the truth. And if you wish to ask them for anything you want you must ask them from behind a screen. This has more influence on your hearts and their hearts to possess virtue in life and conduct. By no means should you cause annoyance or inconvenience to the Messenger of Allah nor is it appropriate ever to marry his widows following his death. This is an enormity in Allah's sight and a deviation from moral righteousness
Whether you reveal your deeds and express your thoughts or hide the deeds and suggest the thoughts secretly to the mind, you must realize that Allah is indeed 'Alimun of all things
Your wives O Muhammad incur no blame nor do they stand at the mark of criticism for discoursing and appearing before their fathers or before their sons, before their brothers or their brothers' sons, before their sisters' sons or before their women or before those who serve them of those they have on hand. As for you O wives of the Prophet: you actuate yourselves with the mixed feeling of dread and reverence toward Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and bear in mind that He is ever a witness to all things
Allah and His angels extend mercy and blessings to the Prophet. O you whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand: invoke Allah's mercy and blessings on him and pray: "Peace be upon him and blessed be he with all divine favours
Indeed, those who defy Allah and His Messenger or challenge them, have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and have incurred Allah's curse here and Hereafter and there awaits them the torment laid upon the damned
And those who unjustly hurt the men or the women in whose hearts reigns piety or offend them for no valid reason will have born malice against themselves and shall stand manifest of a major sin
O you the Prophet: Tell your wives and your daughters and all Muslim women to dress in flowing outer garments which cover them over. This makes it less likely to be identified and be assaulted. And Allah has always been Ghafurun and Rahimun
Unless the hypocrites and those whose hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their inmost being as well as those who incite to rebellion against the Muslims in the city and molest the women cease from such actions, We will instigate you to war upon them and give you mastery over them and they shall then find it difficult to neighbour with you therein but for a short while
Cursed wherever they may be and seized they shall be wherever found and be slain without mercy
A mode of action Allah has long pursued in dealing with those who came to this world before you and you shall not find a change in His mode of action
People call upon you O Muhammad for information relative to the point of time at which the predetermined Eventful Hour of Judgement takes place! Say to them: it is only Allah and Him alone Who knows when! "You never know the Final Hour may well be quite soon
Allah has cursed the infidels and upon them He has poured maledictions and put for them in readiness the tormenting blaze of Hell
wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering and never shall they find therein anyone to protect them nor afford them help
This is a Day when their faces shall be rolled in the Fire and they shall wish they had obeyed Allah and obeyed His Messenger
And they shall say: "O Allah, our Creator, We have obeyed those who were invested with authority among us and those who were exalted in rank and in station and they led us by the nose to the wrong path
O Allah, our Creator "they add" We implore You and We beg You to afflict them with double the torment and to consign them to evil and to pour upon them unbearable loads of maledictions
O you who have conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship: Do not act like those who wronged Mussa but Allah proclaimed his innocence and he has always been held precious in Allah's esteem
O you who have conformed to Islam: Fear Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him. When you express your thoughts in words and when you make a statement or a declaration, do see that your words are a disclosure of facts, apposite, appropriate, relevant and to the point
So that Allah steers you by His guidance to the right doings and actions and blesses your deeds and makes them agree with your words and forgives you your sins. And he who obeys Allah and His Messenger will have gained great victory and obtained supremacy
We offered the "trust" to the heavens, the earth and the mountains -with what it entails of expectation of knowing and reasoning, of feeling and thinking and of obligations and responsibilities- but they declined to bear it for what it involves of burdensome consequences. But man (Adam -his genes-) accepted it and was willing to bear the responsibility and to give an undertaking of fidelity; He was indeed unfair to himself, having no knowledge of the logical Sequence
By consequence shall Allah punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the idolaters and idolatresses who incorporate with Him other deities and He shall give up resentment against the men and the women who faithfully acknowledged His system of faith and worship and pardon their offence. And Allah has always been Ghafurun and Rahimun
Praise be to Allah to Whom our bosoms surge forth and answer thanks for His exclusive individuality in possessing all the animate and the inanimate existing in the heavens and on earth past, present and those to come and extolled are His glorious attributes Hereafter as He is AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations) and AL-Khabir (the Omniscient)
He has omniscience of all that makes entry and penetrates into the earth, be it animate or inanimate, and of all that arises from it and of what erupts from within and of the water streaming out of it. And He has Omniscience of all that comes down from the realm of heaven and from the vault of its floor and of all that ascends of deeds and of the souls of those who have done the deeds. He is also 'Alimun (Omniscient) of the spiritual and the animate and of all that is inanimate and He is AL-Rahim (the Merciful) and AL-Ghafur (the forgiving)
Never, say the infidels: "shall the Final Hour (of Resurrection and Judgement) fulfill itself and come our way." Say to them O Muhammad: "But indeed it shall come about; rest assured by Allah, my Creator, that it shall come upon you with the revolution of time. He is Omniscient of the invisible and the unknown and AL-'Alim whom nothing escapes His vigilance neither in the heavens nor on earth be it in the weight or in the size of an atom or lesser or larger in degree; all being recorded in a documentary book that furnishes evidence of facts and of events
So that He justly requites those who conformed to His system of faith and worship and imprinted their deeds with wisdom and piety. He shall extend to them forgiveness and a gracefully blessed provision
And He justly penalizes those who purposed to deny His revelations and challenge His divine and authoritative signs. They must expect the torment laid upon the damned
Whereas those gifted with divine and spiritual knowledge do know and assert that the discourse inspired to you from Allah is indeed the truth guiding into all truth and it guides to the path that leads directly to Him, AL-Aziz (the Almighty), and AL-Hamid (to Whom are extolled the glorious attributes)
And insolently and mockingly, the infidels say: "Shall we tell you of a man who proclaims that after your bodies have been reduced to fragments and have disintegrated, you will be brought back to life and be created anew
Is he relating to Allah falsehood and pathological lies or is he a demoniac!" The fact is that those who deny Resurrection and Judgement are torturing themselves with their thoughts, being lost in the maze of error
Do they not see what is before them and what is behind them of the heavens and the earth and contemplate their existence, maintenance and conservation. If We willed We could eclipse them in one swallow by a yawning earthly chasm We create beneath them or cause a piece of heaven to fall upon them in the form of discs of cumuli; either incident is by itself a great inducement for lifting to Allah the inward sight by the votary devoted to religious observances and to repentance with a breast filled with reverential awe
We bestowed on Dawud of Our bounty all grace which was made to abound in him. "O you mountains", We said, "play the echo to his praises, and so will you O birds" and We softened for him the iron for making defensive armour
We directed him, thus: "Make coats of arms", We said, "and use your skill and talent in the construction of the chain- work and in the overlapping of the plates to be fastened upon the ground-work". And We said to him and his family: "Do good and imprint your deeds and thoughts with wisdom and piety, I am Bassirun of all that you do
And to Solayman We made subservient the wind covering the distance, normally taking one month, in one morning stride forward and turning in one evening stride backward. We made a source of copper flow freely for him and of the Jinn those serving him by Allah's will, and he -of the Jinn- who defected or did not fulfill Allah's command came within the measure of Allah's wrath and We subjected him to the blazes
They -the Jinn- were assigned to work for him and do as they were told and produce, build and construct for him what he willed of sanctuaries and places of worship in the form of curved structures of firm material; some bearing weight and others merely ornamental. Also to make for him images and statue and all kinds of pots and vessels of rounded form, broad and deep serving various purposes, some being large enough to be reservoirs and others as fixed huge copper vessels. And We said: "Work righteousness O you the sons of Dawud and let your deeds reflect gratitude and gratefulness to Me". But it is only a few of My servants who do this and impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
And when We decreed Solayman's death, nothing drew the Jinn's attention to his death but a little earthly creature gnawing the base of his staff on which he leaned that he fell. There and then did the Jinn realize that had they known the hidden and the unknown and realized the unseen they would not have remained in the slavish disposition scourged with humility and torture
There was a great sign indicative of Allah's mercy and bounty which were extended to the people of Saba in their home-land and Allah's grace was made to abound in them. They enjoyed fertile and productive land covered with carpets of greenery and orchards right and left; they were told: "Eat of what Allah has provisioned you of sustenance and enjoy it, it is all replete with choice of all delight and be thankful to Him. Productive of incalculable good was the land and Gracious and Ghafurun, the Ilah, the Creator
But they declined to show appreciation of the condition of things and be sensible of Allah's grace, and furthermore they failed to impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness. By consequence, We sent against them torrential rain causing destruction of their dam, built to confine the water and to regulate its flow, and We replaced their fertile land and their orchards with gardens of bitter fruit, shrubs of small tamarisk trees and a few of the Lotus trees and other trees carrying berry- like drupe
Such was the thrashing We gave those who welcomed wrongs, but then do We punish but the ungrateful who deviates from sense and declines the divine standard
Yet We did not tear them apart but We kept the villages which stood conspicuous between their towns and the towns We blessed.* And We made these villages - serve as stations or stopping-places on their journeys and their commercial travels, And We determined the distances and the units of time to a scale inducing the feeling of comfort and safety and We said to them: You may travel by night or by day, you will be safe and secure
But lacking patience and endurance, they, to their detriment, prayed: "O Allah, our Creator, would You make our stations distant and far apart and not close together and our commercial travels remote in time" and they wronged themselves. In response to this request We made them the talk of the town existing then and of those towns existing thereafter. We tore them apart, while those who remained lived dispersed among the Bedouins in the desert and among other people else-where. This was an act making the patient who is thankful lift to Allah his inward sight
And sure enough was AL-Shaytan (Satan) in the right when he thought he would be able to lead them by the nose to their loss in the maze of error. They followed his footsteps except those few who revered Allah and were faithful to Him
In fact AL-Shaytan had no authority over them but We occasioned his attempt to tempt them to identify justly those who affirm with certainty and satisfaction the fundamental truth of the Hereafter and those who are in doubt thereof. And Allah your Creator is indeed Hafizun. (He Keeps a vigilant eye upon the whole and upon all in all)
Say to them O Muhammad: "you may invoke those whom or which you presume gods besides Allah and you shall realize that they do not possess even as little as an atom in the realm of the heavens and the earth nor do they have an atom of power either, not to mention a share therein. And Allah is Absolute and Independent, He needs none of them to afford Him help
Nor shall intercession take effect with Him in Day of Judgement except from those permitted. And when the overwhelming effect of terror is eased off and the hearts calm down, the infidels shall ask: What was it that Allah said! They shall be told: "The Truth." And He is AL-'Aliyo (the Unique whose attributes belong to the highest regions of thought and reality, the Unique Who is eminently entitled to the designation "the Supreme") and AL-Kabir (the Omniscient)
Ask them O Muhammad: Who provides you with livelihood from the heavens - rain, heat, light- and from the earth (plants, animals, springs, oil, minerals and treasures)! And say to them: "It is Allah" and say to them: "Obviously some of us are treading the path of truth and righteousness and the others treading the path leading to the loss in the maze of error
And say to them: "You shall never have to answer for our wrongs and our misgivings nor shall we have to answer for your deeds
And say to them: "Allah shall bring us all to assemble before Him together in Day of Judgement and then He decides our case with equity and justice; He is AL-Fattah (the One Who resolves matters and brings them to a decision) and He is AL-'Alim (the Omniscient)
And say to them: Would you show me those deities whom or which you incorporate with Him and share, as you presume, His divine nature! How repulsive to the imagination and how unpleasant to contemplate! But He is Allah, AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim
We have not sent you, -O Muhammad- to the people at large but to serve as a spectacle and a warning but most people do fail to realize this fact
For this reason they doubt Judgement and they ask: "when will that promise of Judgement be fulfilled if indeed you declare the truth
Say to them "You have a predetermined point in the abysm of time which you cannot alter nor bring into effect one hour earlier nor one hour later
Pitifully, the infidels declare: "We will not acknowledge this Quran nor the preceding Scriptures". If you Muhammad could envisage the wrongful of actions when they stand before Allah for Judgement expressing reproaches against each other, You will hear those who were viewed with contempt saying to those whose pride consistently got the better of their prudence: "Had it not been for you we would have conformed to Allah's system of daily and worship
Then the extravagant in their accounts of themselves say to those viewed with contempt: "Did we stand in your way and hinder you from accepting the spirit of truth which reached you to guide you into all truth?" "The fact is" they will add, "that you were people who grew daily more and more wicked
And there shall the passively-minded say to those who exercised inordinate self-esteem: "but you took cunning for a sinister and crooked wisdom and you made its breastplate work day and night and you kept pressing hard upon us for adopting polytheism and you urged us to deny Allah as the only Ilah and to incorporate with Him other deities". Deep in their hearts they will feel their guilt with pining regrets and vain repentances when they see the inescapable punishment. We will fetter and confine the infidels with chains around their necks. Would they be requited but with what is commensurate with their deeds
We never sent a Messenger, a spectacle and a warning, to a nation but stood those with the riches similitude exact of your people O Muhammad and said to him "We do deny your mission and we do not acknowledge the message you proclaim
And they added: "we are more affluent in wealth and in progeny than those who accepted your message with consenting mind; our affluence confers immunity and therefore we will not be subjected to punishment
Say to them "It is Allah, my Creator Who gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously to whom He will and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will but most people fail to realize this fact
(You people had better realize that) neither your wealth nor your progeny are the conditions vouchsafing for your nearness to Allah nor do they sanction your misdeeds or your infidelity. To the contrary, what bring closer to Allah are conforming one's will to His will and imprinting one's deeds with wisdom and piety. Such persons shall be requited with double the reward commensurate with their deeds and shall live safe and secure in stately abodes
And those who strive to oppose Our authoritative signs and invalidate Our divine revelations shall be consigned to the torment laid upon the damned
Say to them O Muhammad: "Indeed, it is Allah, my Creator, Who gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously to whom He will of His servants and restrains it if He will. And whatever you spend in His cause and in benevolence, He replenishes it, for He is the most capable of meeting peoples' needs and the best Purveyor of all requisites of His creatures
And on the Day He throngs them all for Judgement He shall question the angels, thus: "Are these they who revered you and adored you with appropriate acts and rites
Glory be to You O Allah", they shall say, "and extolled are Your glorious attributes. You are our tutelary Guardian, but it was the Jinn they worshipped and regarded as truthful and had faith in their rights and their powers
There and then shall all he told: "This is the day on which none of you has power over the others nor can any of you avail or do harm to the others". We will say to the wrongful of actions: "Now taste the torment of the Fire which you had consistently denied
Yet when Our clear and lucid revelations are recited to them they proclaim: "This man -Muhammad- is no more than someone who intends to stand in your way to make you deviate from the path your fathers had followed and to deny those deities they adored with appropriate acts and rites and they add" This Quran is nothing but a pack of lies and a devised pious fraud" And the infidels said when the truth when was presented to them: "This is nothing but the work of magic and sorcery made manifest in him
But We never sent or revealed to these people* divine Books to apply their minds to acquire learning and by consequence be able to evaluate the Quran. Nor did We send to them before you O Muhammad as Messenger a spectacle and a warning
Similarly acted those who preceded them, they denied Our divine message and they rejected the truth, notwithstanding Allah's grace abounding in them. Affluence inflated them with pride whereas these people have not attained one tenth of what those of old attained: affluence in knowledge, wealth, power and the art of construction. Puffed up, they accused Our Messengers of falsehoods and how evil was the end for which they were destined
Say to them: "I advise you to think and think but this one single fact, you stand before Allah in pairs to reason with one another and singly to reason with your own conscience that your companion -the Messenger Muhammad- is not a demoniac but a spectacle and a warning who cautions you against the severe punishment you shall face if you do not deviate into sense
And say to them: "I never asked of you a price, my advice to you is entirely in your own interest while my reward rests in the hands of Allah Who is Shahidun (Who witnesses all things)
Say to them: "Indeed Allah, my Creator, projects the truth upon calumnies wherefore it overthrows falsehood. He is Allam (Omniscient) of all the unseen and unknown
Say to them: "The truth has finally arrived and now what can falsehood do hut vanish and what can it bring back but its own self-destruction
Say to them: "If I should deviate from sense as to tread the wrong path leading into error, then I will have hurt my own soul. And if I should follow the path of righteousness leading into the truth, it is only because Providence is my guide. He inspires me with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth; He is Sami'un (His audition is unlimited) and Qaribun. His Omnipresence puts Him in the proximity of all His created beings
And if you Muhammad could envisage the scene which shall excite their terror Hereafter, no escape can they make and they shall be seized in the proximity of Hell
And now they say: "We believe", but how can they attain faith Hereafter which is so far away from Here below where they had the opportunity to attain it but they did not
They denied it before and they assailed what is unknown or unseen and what is essentially spiritual with slander while they were far distant in the world of life below
And now between right and wrong resides justice intervening between them and their wish of attaining faith now in order to escape the torment of the fire facing them but they cannot. This is exactly what had befallen their likes who were suspicious of the truth which they considered void for uncertainty
Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes Who has generated the heavens and the earth and designated the angels as envoys furnished with pairs of wings in sets of two, three and four. He adds, joins or unites one thing to another at creation so as to increase the number, the size or the importance of a given created being or beings as He will Allah is indeed Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things
Should Allah open His gates of mercy to the people -in the form of the material or the immaterial- no one can close these gates or obstruct the flow of what He has permitted nor be able to withhold it either. And if He should withhold it -in one form or another- no one can accord it besides Him; He is AL- Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
O you people: Let your remembrance apply to Allah and bear in mind His grace abounding in you by impelling yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness. And think and think but this: is there a creator other than Allah who provisions you with livelihood from the heavens above and from the earth below! There is no Ilah but Him, therefore how could you counsel deaf to the truth
And should they -the infidels- deny your mission O Muhammad and accuse you of falsehood so, were Messengers before you. They were met with the same negative response and were accused of want of conformity to the truth. And to Allah, the Ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and Hereafter
O you people: rest assured that Allah's promise is the truth personified and so, do not let life below deceive you and entangle you with the birdlime of fleshy passion and mundane vanity nor should anything -power, business, wealth, knowledge, long life, status, lust, nor anyone- -AL-Shaytan (Satan) or those with characteristics befitting him- alienate you ever from Allah
And you had better realize that AL-Shaytan is your avowed enemy and therefore consider him malignant and deal with him accordingly. He incites his followers and presents to them inducements designating them as his adherents and destine them to the blazing Fire
Those who deny Allah and reject His system of faith and worship must expect the torment laid upon the damned, whereas those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety must expect forgiveness and an imposing reward
Does he who is enticed by his deeds of evil and iniquities alluring his mind's eyes and inducing him to hug his irreverent conviction to his heart compare with him whose deeds reflect wisdom and piety! Allah misguides indeed whom He will and guides to His path of righteousness whom He will. Therefore, do not let yourself O Muhammad be affected with grief and deep sorrow for their irreverent response to the divine message nor should you lament their deviation from sense with sighing Allah is 'Alimun (Omniscient indeed of all that they do)
Allah is He Who sends the wind carrying water vapour extracted chiefly from the water mass on the surface of the earth to raise clouds spreading in the floor of the vault of heaven, We drive them to, a dead or droughty land where they pour their rain water with which We revive the land after it had Suffered death; similarly do We effect Resurrection
He who seeks the mundane glory and power must realize that such | attributes arc entirely those of Allah to Whom ascend the good words and He accepts the pious act which He welcomes in His realm of heaven and adorns with honour and exaltation. And those who take their cunning for a sinister and crooked wisdom fraught with evil shall suffer the torment laid upon the damned; their cunning bordering upon knavery is rendered vain
And Allah raised you –people- by special creations from dust then He made you evolve from a constituent part of emitted fluid* and He made of you two sex divisions of organic beings, a male and a female.* And no female human or animal conceives a seed in her womb or gives birth to a child or an animal respectively but comes to His knowledge, nor does he who is carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life proceed or recede in age but in accordance with what is brought to book and this presents no difficulty to Allah
Nor do the two kinds of flowing waters compare: one fresh and sweet pleasant to drink and the other salty and bitter, and from each do you eat tender meat and you obtain various kinds of gems you use as articles of ornaments carried on your bodies. And you see the ships -the large sea-going vessels and the river- boats- ploughing through the waves and cleaving the surface thereof to help you accomplish your objects sought after of His bounty to the end that your bosoms may hopefully surge and answer thanks
He causes the night to lose its character and identity* by absorption into the day and He causes the day to lose its character and identity by absorption into the night and He reduced the sun and the moon to a state of subservience, each describing its orbit for a determined period of time. This is Allah, your Creator, Who has the sovereignty of the universe and its supreme controlling power, whereas those you invoke besides Him do not own even as little as the integument of the smallest seed nor do they exercise over it the least control
And if you invoke them for no matter what they do not hear your invocation and even if they heard it they would not be able to respond favourably or unfavourably; and in Day of Judgement they shall deny your irreverence to Allah and what you attribute to Him of plurality. And no one can inform you of the truth like Him. Who is Khabirun
O you people, your existence is conditioned by the will of Allah, you are so destitute as to be dependent on Him for livelihood and sustenance and you are in need of Him for guidance and He is AL-Gheniyo (the Independent and the Absolute.) and AL-Hamid (His grace abounds in the universe and He is Worthy of all praise)
If He wills He could do away with you -people- and replace you with a new creation
And this raises no difficulty ever for Him to effect
Nor would a soul heavily laden with wrongs find a single one to disburden her of some of her wrongs, nor the least of her burden be carried by any one else even if related by consanguinity. Your admonition and warning O Muhammad take effect with those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah albeit they do not apprehend Him by sight and they attend to religious Observances. And he who presents himself with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety will have successfully saved his own soul, and to Allah is the final and inevitable destination
They are not esteemed alike: those who lack intellectual, moral and spiritual perception and those who perceive mentally and apprehend the truth by thought
Nor do they compare: the abysm of darkness and/or want of spiritual and intellectual sight and the illumination and enlightenment and the emanation of light
Nor are they of a like nature: "the shade" affording coolness and the sun radiating heat
Nor do the living -a life deserving the name- and the dead physically or spiritually compare. Allah's voice reaches whom He will but your voice O Muhammad shall never reach those deposited in the graves
You arc only a spectacle and a warning
We have sent you with the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and never was there a nation but had a Messenger, a spectacle and a warning
And if they -the infidels- do reject the divine message and accuse you of falsehood and regard you as someone who passes himself off as someone other than he is, then you must realize that similarly acted those who preceded them They received Messengers with the divine message carrying evidence sufficient enough to establish their authority to implement Our statutes and Our Scriptures as well as the Book of enlightenment and illumination
In consequence, did I cast them from a position of prosperity and power and brought them to ruin and how unbearable and befitting was the retribution
Do you not sec that Allah sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven rain water causing the fruits to spring up from the soil in various colours. He made in the mountains paths, natural roads, passages and tracks of varied hues: white and red of various shades and others of raven black (each reflecting the colour of the dominant mineral its rocks contain)
And of people, reptilian and cattle variegation also holds true. Thus, such of Allah's servants as stand in awe of Him are the savants. Allah is Azizun (Almighty) and Ghafurun (Forgiving)
Indeed, those who recite Allah's Book -to themselves or to an audience- - from memory or by reading and in an appropriate manner- and observe their act of worship and do spend of what We bestowed on them of Our bounty in Allah's cause and in benevolence secretly and openly must expect a satisfying return for the commerce they have between Allah and themselves and in their intercourse in the affairs of life
This is to satisfy their needs, to reward them with what is commensurate with their deeds and to make His grace abound in them, He is indeed Ghafurun and Shakurun (Thankful)
And rest assured O Muhammad that all that We inspire to you of the Book -the Quran- is indeed the truth personified. It corroborates and confirms what had preceded of divine Books and Scriptures. He is indeed Khabirun (Omniscient) and Bassirun (the Omnipresent) Whose constant vigilance is extended to all His creatures
And We made the Book an heritage We bequeathed to such of Our servants as We have chosen and taken by preference. Some of them, the wrongful of actions, are being unfair to themselves. Others choose a middle way between right and wrong and some do vie by the grace of Allah in doing all that is good and all that reflects wisdom and piety. This is indeed the sufficient grace abounding in whom He will as well as the efficacious grace which effects the end for which it is given
Such persons who vie in doing good are those who shall be heartily welcomed in the Gardens of Eden wherein they shall be destined to make abode and wherein they shall be adorned with golden and pearled-bracelets and vested all in silken attire
Actuated with the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness they shall express their thoughts in words, thus: "We are indeed grateful to Allah Who has redeemed us out of all dread and sorrow and of the insecure feeling and the harassing anxiety of this Event". "Allah, our Creator, is indeed Ghafurun and Shakurun
So gracious He is as to settle us in the Eternal abode wherein no touch of struggle mentally or physically shall there be and free from all touch of weariness we will be
But those -infidels- who deny Him shall have to suffer for it. Hell shall assert them as her own and therein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering. Never shall they perish in the wreck of time or suffer death nor shall their torment be mitigated, for thus do We requite the ungrateful who display no gratitude
While in the abysm of Hell, they shall implore Allah in a loud and excited voice, thus: O Allah, our Creator, deliver us out of it. We will imprint our deeds with wisdom and piety contrary to the wrong and the evil We did before. But they shall be told. "Did We not give you life long enough to give a chance to him who was willing to open his heart's ears and to lift to Allah his inward sight!. You received Allah's Messengers who warned you of this unbearable Eventful Event! Therefore, you taste the fatal consequences and do not expect any one to afford you help
Allah is 'Alimun indeed of all the invisible and the unknown in the heavens and on earth. He holds prescience of all private thoughts and feelings that are reposited in the breasts
He is it Who has inducted you vicegerents on earth and made one generation inherit the other. Therefore, he who rejects the truth and denies the divine origin of the message will have hurt himself with his infidelity and nothing infidelity adds to the infidels' debit in heaven's realm but hatred and aversions And nothing infidelity adds to their fate but loss and ruin and moral and spiritual damnation
Say to them O Muhammad: Do you -infidels- see those whom you regard as your predominant partners and invoke besides Allah! Show me what section of the earth they have created, or do they go shares with Allah in the sovereignty of the heavens and they are the possessors thereof! Or did We give them a Book illuminating their eyes and imparting spiritual and intellectual enlightenment! The fact is that the wrongful of actions make promises to each other and nothing they promise but what is vain, deceptive and deluding
Allah is He Who sustains and supports the heavens (their contents) and keeps them from going out of order losing balance or scattering and vanishing. Should they be thrown about in disorder, who else other than Him can restore them to order! He has always been Halimun (forbearing) and Ghafurun
The infidels make a solemn declaration with an appeal to Allah that if there comes to them a spectacle and warning they would regard him with more reverence than any other people and they would be more prepared than all others to acknowledge the message of truth guiding into all truth. Yet when there came to them the spectacle and the warning their mental attitude -pitifully- made them more averse
Their rejection of the truth reflected their inordinate self-esteem and their extravagance in their accounts of themselves; they took their cunning for a sinister and crooked wisdom, a cunning fraught with evil. But the cunning that is fraught with evil besets only those who take it for a sinister and crooked wisdom. Do they not see into the mode of action adopted by Allah with those of old and has long been pursued by Him. -His just retributive punishment!- And you shall not find a change in Allah's mode of action nor shall you find deviation in His method of dealing with people -warning then punishing
Have they not journeyed through the land and looked with their minds' eyes to see what was the end of those who preceded them who were far mightier than they are and their diligence never wearied! Nonetheless, their might conferred on them no immunity against Allah's retributive punishment. Nothing irrespective of its nature can stand in Allah's way or impede His course of action or frustrate the laws and statutes of His realm in the heavens or on earth; He has always been 'Alimun and Qadirun
If Allah were to plant the People's Hereafter in the now and impose on them what is commensurate with their deeds, not one single earthling animate being would be left on its surface. But He mercifully respites them to a predetermined point of time that they might hopefully deviate into sense and turn to Him. When it is time to pay to nature their due debt they shall come to know that Allah has always been Bassirun keeping a vigilant eye upon all this created beings
(Ya), S. (Seen), the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people’s tongue, cannot be emulated
And by the Quran, the prime source of wisdom
You Muhammad are indeed one of the Messengers chosen to relate Allah’s divine message
And you are pursuing the path of righteousness
A disclosure of divine knowledge sent down from the realm of heaven by the command of the AL-Aziz (the Almighty), AL-Rahim
And you shall use it O Muhammad as the divine law expressing the will of Allah to warn a people whose fathers received no Messenger as a spectacle and a warning before; and they are oblivious of what they owe to Allah, to themselves and to the people at large
The prophecy of their aversion to the divine message by the majority has been fulfilled, for they decline to accept it
We have surrounded their necks with chains drawn up to their chins restraining the movement of their heads and riveting their eyes and their minds away from the truth
And We erected a barrier before them and a barrier behind them to eclipse their minds' eyes to deny them forethought and foresight; and Allah's marvels around them and in themselves they fail to see
Such persons O Muhammad whether you warn them of impending danger and misfortunes or you do not, it is one and the same; they counsel deaf and will not open their hearts' ears nor their minds’ eyes
Your voice can be heard only by those who hear the voice of Allah expressing His will in the Quran and keep in awe of Him albeit not apprehending Him by sight. Announce to them joyful tidings of Allah’s forgiveness and an imposing reward
It is We Who raise the dead and record all they have advanced to their credit or debit-of deeds, acts, thoughts and actions and the aftermath of their doings. And all in all have We registered in a prototype, the archetypal Book
And cite to them the inhabitants of the town to whom We sent Our Messengers, an example by way of a parable, by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth
We sent to them two of Our envoys whom they declined to accept and accused them of falsehood. We sustained them by a third who together with the other two assured them thus: "We have been commissioned by Allah". they said, "and entrusted with His divine message which we relate to you
But the inhabitants said: "But you are simply mortals like us and never did Allah, AL-Rahman, disclose divine knowledge or anything else to a mortal: "You are indeed liars
And there, the messengers said: " Indeed, does Allah, our Creator, know that we have been entrusted with His divine message to relate it to you
And we are responsible only for proclaiming His divine message distinctly expressing all that is meant, leaving nothing merely implied
But again the people said to the Messengers: "We augur from you and we esteem you as omens presaging some direful calamity, therefore unless you stop holding discourse of this faked message, we will pelt you with stones and you shall suffer grievously at our hands
The Messengers said: "You augur well or ill according to your disposition and your intentions, and the mould of your fortune is in yourselves and the event is only sanctioned by Allah". And do you people, they added, "consider the spirit of truth that guides into all truth a presage of evil! You are but a people characterized by disobedience and transgression
And there came a man from the far end of the city, moved with compassion for his fellow men who rejected what he knew to be the truth, to say to them: "O my people, obey them, they are Messengers entrusted with the spirit of truth- that guides into all truth
Obey them", he added, "they do not ask you for a price or anything in return, they themselves are guided into all truth and wish to relate it to you
And why should I not regard Allah with extreme devotion", he said, "and adore Him with appropriate acts and rites when it is He Who brought me into being and caused me to exist and He is the end and the purpose for which We are destined and to Him shall all of us return
Therefore, would I take besides Him gods whose intercession, if ever permitted, is valueless nor can they protect me or save me from harm should He, AL-Rahman, mean to befall me with a misfortune or wed me to a calamity
For then the work of the devil will have been manifest in me and I would have been led by the nose to the loss in the maze of error
Hear me", he said, "as I declare that I have acknowledged Allah, your Creator, and accepted His system of faith and worship with a consenting mind and you shall bear witness to this declaration here and Hereafter
(The man might have suffered martyrdom at their hands) Received with gracious and hearty welcome and great honour in heaven’s Realm, he was ushered to Paradise and there he exclaimed: "I wish my people knew
How has Allah, my Creator, received me, forgiven me and united me with those who are highly esteemed and greatly honoured
We did not follow this incident by sending down a host from heaven against his people nor was it necessary to mobilize Our angels
All it took was a single direful cry from heaven’s realm that stirred up a merciless blast extinguishing them and blotting them out of existence
A great pity upon intellectual animate beings and servants! No Messenger do they receive as an envoy of Allah but they bombard him with foul epithets, mock him and laugh him to scorn
Do they not perceive by sight, apprehend by thought and learn by reading how many generations who existed before them We have destroyed and they had gone whence they shall not return
And that they together with their predecessors and their predominant partners and those they incorporated with Allah shall be brought back to Us and be gathered for Judgement
A blessing is being extended to them to contemplate, an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace: "the dead land which We revive and from its soil We cause grain to spring out for them to eat
And We furnished the land out with orchards of date-palms and vines and gave vent to affluence of flowing springs
So that they eat of their flowers when they come to be fruits and grow ripe. It Is all replete with choice of all delights. And none of these natural products was nor will it be of their own making or their handiwork All natural objects, animal, vegetable and mineral are Allah’s handiwork. And so, will they not impel themselves with the feeling of gratitude
Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes Who created all the sexual pairs of such things as the earth produces and of themselves – mankind – and of what they do not know – and yet to know and of what is beyond their mental perception and recognition
Another outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace. is the night which We strip of daylight and there, they are driven into darkness
And the sun runs its course and describes its orbit, sited in a settled position, belonging, as determined by AL-Aziz, AL-'Alim
And for the moon We have determined mansions or divisions of the ecliptic which it occupies on 28 successive days and there it falls in a swoon and be like a shriveled and withered date-stalk
The sun ought not gain impetus more than the limit designated so that it does not catch up the moon or overtake it in motion nor does the night outrun the day and each describes its own orbit
Another outward and visible sign reflecting for them an inward and spiritual grace is that We carried their descendants in the loaded ark
And We created for them the like thereof for their transport
And if We willed We could drown them and no one would be there to hear their yelling nor would there be an expected rescue
Unless We extend to them Our mercy and let them enjoy life up to a predetermined point of time
And when they are told: "Fear for your irreverence to Allah and regard with fear the retributive punishment which you might encounter here. Fear also what awaits you Hereafter which is indeed grievous and really severe so that you might hopefully be recipients of Allah’s mercy
And no divine sign of Allah's marvels be presented to them but they meet with aversion and oppose it with repugnance
And when told to spend in benevolence of what Allah has bestowed them and given them of His bounty, the infidels express their thoughts in words and pitifully say: "Shall we feed him whom Allah can feed if He will! You must be deviated in mind and have wandered from the path of righteousness
And incidentally" they add: " When does that alleged promise – Hereafter – fall due, if indeed you are declaring the truth
Do they mean to wait until a merciless blast seizes them while they are more ready to argue than to obey
And then it is too late to act nor do they have the chance to settle or dispose of their affairs verbally or in writing nor to their people will they return
Then the trumpet is sounded and there they egress from the graves and toward Allah, their Creator, they move with impetuousity
Wherefore they exclaim: "woe betide us! Who has awakened us from our resting site?" This is, they are told, "what Allah had promised and the verity which the truthful Messengers had related
Then, there is only one single loud call which raises alarm and incites to action and there they are assembled before Us for Judgement
This Day shall no soul suffer injustice or be wronged in the least and you – people– shall only be requited with what is commensurate with your deeds
And this Day shall those destined to the abode in Paradise be preoccupied with the world of supreme blessedness in which they do rejoice beyond a common joy
And together with their mates they shall be reclining on luxurious couches in the shades afforded by trees and overshadowing foliage
Wherein they shall enjoy fruits as well as all that they think of and whatever they ask for
They shall be greeted with the expression of good will "Peace" from Allah, the Creator, Who is indeed Rahimun
And the infidels are addressed, thus: "Excluded and confined you are, O you transgressors of the divine law and offenders against Allah
In reproach they are told; "Did I not," says Allah "enjoin you children of Adam to reject AL-Shaytan (Satan) and those with characteristics befitting him and to refuse credence to them, for he was indeed your avowed enemy and deadly foe
And I prescribed for you authoritatively and with emphasis that you worship Me, for this was indeed the path of righteousness, the path that leads directly to Me
Indeed AL-Shaytan had succeeded in misleading you in great numbers. Did you have no sense to realize and confess yourselves mistaken
This, as you can see, is Hell which you had been promised
As of this Day you will suffer its scorching effect and the torment that it lays upon the damned in requital of your disobedience, your denial of the truth and of your intentional assertion of falsehood
In this Day –of Judgement*– We will seal their lips and endow their hands with voice and together with their feet shall evidence all they had done or left undone
And had it been Our will We would have eclipsed their eye sight and their minds' eyes, then they would have competed with each other for finding their way, but how could they have been able to see it
And had We willed We would have transmuted them and frozen them physically and spiritually in their unprivileged site, then they would have been unable to move forward to repent and do good nor backward to do evil
Do they not ponder that he whom We carry through the stealing steps of age to advanced life, We cause to relapse into a degenerate and degraded state of mind, activity, knowledge, strength and status and make him lose the qualities and attributes he once possessed. Do they not deviate into sense and contemplate this fact
And We did not teach him poetry nor did We instruct him to play the poet or compose poetry nor does it befit him as a Messenger of Allah. What he discourses is indeed a divine message and nothing but a Quran that is intelligible, imparting illumination and enlightenment
To use it as the means for a profitable end and to exhort those who are living and spiritually receptive to Allah's commands and to warn those who are spiritually dead to alter their irreverent course of action when warned of its danger, wherefore infidelity shall be justly laid to their charge
Do the infidels not see that besides Our handiwork We have created for them cattle and made them the owners and the masters thereof
And We made them –the cattle– subservient to them in one way or other; some of them do they ride and of others they eat
And they order them in subservience to their profitable end and design – skin for leather, fur for warmth – and of their milk they drink. Do they not feel obligated and in consequence impel themselves to gratitude and gratefulness
Yet they take besides Allah other deities whom or which they regard, with extreme devotion and adore with appropriate acts and rites that they might hopefully afford them help
When in fact the false gods have no power to be of avail to them ever, not to mention their total inability to afford them help. On the contrary it is the infidels who afford them protection and round about them they are garrisoned like a camp of faithful soldiery
Therefore, let not their vain and unreasonable discourse O Muhammed grieve you at heart. We do know what they converse secretly or whisper under their breath and what they suggest secretly to the mind and all that their breasts store of thoughts and feelings. And We are well acquainted with all that they utter loudly and with all that is being said
Does man not perceive mentally and by visual tokens that We brought him into being from a seed -the constituent part of emitted fluid!- Yet he sets himself against Allah and displays his thought in his actions
And he draws meaningless parallels and sets forth to Us comparisons and he expresses his thoughts in words, thus: "Who shall restore life", he asks, "to these bones when they have undergone morbid changes and degeneracy
Say to him: "He Who brought them into being in the beginning when He started creation from nothingness shall restore them to life, and He is AL-'Alim of the whole and of all in all
Who rendered for you from the green trees fuel for fire-wood, coal, oil, gas – and you cause it to burn
Is He Who has created the heavens and the earth not able to create their likes anew! Indeed He is. And He is the Creator Supreme, AL-'Alim of all
Whenever it is His will to bring, anything (animate or inanimate) into being, all it takes is to say "Be" and "it is
Wherefore. blessed be He and praise to Him Who has the glorious attributes, in whose hands reside the Sovereign Authority and the supreme controlling power of the whole and of all in all and back to Him shall all of you return
By those angels. who draw up in ranks arranged in even rows
And by those who take a firm stand against evil and bring it into reproach to be a reproach to the wrongdoer
And by those who recite the Quran to hear the voice of Allah expressing his will
Allah your creator is but One and only
Creator and Sovereign of the heavens and the earth and of all that lies between and He is their Supreme controlling power. He is the Sovereign of all eastern cardinal points near which the sun rises in its apparent passage through the signs of the zodiac
We have embellished the vault of the lowermost heaven with the brilliancy and splendour of the inlaid stars
That are posted to serve also as sentinels against every bold satanic and a lawless and wicked spirit
Who peers inquisitively into the realm making an effort to hear what is discussed in the August Assembly, but they are debarred, being assailed with flames on every side
Fiery discharges forcing them back, that is besides what awaits them of an eternal suffering induced by the lasting torment laid upon the damned
And he who ventures upon catching whatever comes to his hearing of the secrets or future events is pursued by a piercing flame which does not miss
Therefore, ask them O Muhammad: Are they the more difficult to bring into being or the others of Our inanimate created beings We created them -mankind- from coherent clay
And there, you Muhammad are filled with Admiration and wonder at Allah's infinite power to create what He will and you marvel at His Omnipotence to restore the dead to life Hereafter while they mock the issue and laugh it to scorn
And when exhorted to acknowledge Allah's Oneness, Uniqueness, Omnipotence and Omniscience, they pay no heed
And when they see a sign attesting to these attributes they look at it as an occasion of derision
And they express their thoughts in words, thus: "This is nothing but sorcery made evident to the eye and the mind
Maintaining the false dictum, they add: "How can we be raised after death and be restored to life after we have been reduced to dust and disintegrated bones
And does this", they say, also apply to our forefathers who have long been disintegrated and strewed upon the surface of the earth
Say to them O Muhammad: "Yes indeed, and you shall be incensed with multiplied wrongs and humiliation
All it takes is only one single loud call inciting to action and there they get up and rise from bed and be able to look around
And there, they -the infidels- will exclaim thus: "Woe betide us, this is the promised Day of Judgement
There and then they will be told: "This is the Day of Judgement and final decision, the Day on which the faithful are segregated from the infidels, this is the Day you have always denied
Throng all the wrongful of actions together with their wives who habited in falsehood and with those they revered and adored with appropriate acts and rites
Who regarded their false gods with extreme devotion besides Allah. Guide them all O angels toward the path leading directly into the abysm of Hell
But stop them here for now they have much to answer for
They are asked: "How is it that you do not help one another Hereafter as you did her below
But they are at a disadvantage in this Day of Judgement, they give themselves up into Allah's power and they resign themselves to His command
They will convey their thoughts reciprocally in talk, holding discourse of the why and the wherefore and of the how and when of life and past events relative to their actions, their responses, their reactions and their fate
Those who yielded to external influence will recriminate those who led them by the nose into error, they will say: "You had always approached us from the right-hand side which we presumed to be the way of moral rightness and spiritual salvation
But", the accused will say: "You yourselves were a people whose hearts never reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues nor were you receptive of the truth
Nor did we have authority over you or impose on you an edict or edicts; the fact is that you played the tyrant and were people given to transgression
And the word of Allah", they Will add, "which was predicted beforehand is being fulfilled, and now will all of us experience the taste of the punishment falling to us as our lot and making us bewail at the day we were born
And they will say in addition: "We made you depart from the path of righteousness for we ourselves were holders of mistaken and false beliefs
Wherefore shall all those who denied Allah and incorporated with Him other deities go shares in what falls to their lot in Day of Judgement of the torment laid upon the damned from hence forever
For thus do We requite the sinful who grow daily more and more wicked
When they were told in life: "There is no supreme being but Allah", they responded with extravagance in their accounts of themselves and displayed inordinate self-esteem
And they expressed their thoughts in words, thus: "shall we" they said, "forsake our gods on account of what has been said by whom we hold certainly a demoniac
When to the contrary, he presented to them the spirit of truth that guides into all truth, confirming the divine message related to the people by the Messengers who were sent before him
Then they, will be told: You -infidels- shall certainly experience the taste of the torment laid upon the damned
And you shall be requited with what is commensurate with your deeds
But excluded from punishment in the abysm of Hell shall be those who were faithful to Allah and sincerely conformed to His system of faith and worship
Such persons shall be provisioned with what Allah has mercifully reserved for them of expected grace and of what is replete with choice of all delights
They are presented with fruits, and they will be bearing their honours thick upon them and treated with honour
In the beatitude of heaven in the gardens of supreme blessedness and happiness
Seated on thrones of dignity facing each other
Attended upon and served with a drink in the cup of Joy procured from a spring flowing like a fountain
Clear white procuring alacrity to those who drink it
Free from intoxicants and not exhaustive to the faculties of the brain
Companioned with beautiful women of modest gaze and gleaming eyes radiating splendour
Beauties who look as though they were clear pure white eggs affording keen pleasure to the eye, guarded under the shadow of a gracious wing
And there shall the faithful convey their thoughts reciprocally in talk holding discourse of the why and the wherefore of past events in life below
One of them (a representative) will say: "I had a companion in life below
Who used to say to me: Do you honestly believe in resurrection and its aftermath
Do you mean, that after we die and be reduced to dust and disintegrated bones, we will be restored to life and have much to answer for
Then he will say to those around: "Do you see those who made their abode in Hell
And he looks, only to see him -his companion in life- in the abyss of Hell
And there, he will exclaim against his companion: "Good gracious, you almost succeeded in making of me a child of perdition and an inheritor of Hell
Had it not been", he will say, "for Allah's mercy and grace l would have been among those dragged and hauled over the flames in the pit of Hell
And he will ask himself wondering thus: "is it then that having paid nature its debt we suffer no death
Other than that first death we suffered in the world below and we live from hence to forever exempt from heavens high jurisdiction and punishment
This is indeed great", he will say, "and triumph supreme
For the accomplishment of a like exalted end Hereafter shall endeavour those who aspire to attain it
Now is this honoured end affording happiness and delightful provision better or the entertainment which provides the evil fruit plucked from the obnoxious tree of zaqqum
The tree We caused to grow especially for the trial in sharp tribulation and misery of the wrongful of actions
It is a tree springing up from the pit in the abysm of Hell
A tree whose branches are full of spadicies looking as though they were the abhorrent heads of the devils
It is the source of aliment the infidels shall eat and fill their bellies
And their thirst shall be quenched with a mixture of repulsive ingredients dissolved in boiling water
Having drunk the cup of misery they are cast back into the abysm of Hell
They found their fathers treading the wrong path leading to the loss in the maze of error
And with their hearts' ears closed and with their minds' eyes blind they insisted on walking in their fathers' footsteps
Similarly behaved long before them most of those of old; they insisted on treading the path of error
Notwithstanding that We did send to them Messengers as spectacles and warnings
And there you can see the fatal consequence of those whom We exhorted -but they counselled deaf
But excluded from that ill-fate were those votaries faithful to Allah and sincere in mind and spirit
Nuh invoked Us appealing for aid and how excellent was the divine response
And We delivered him together with his family excluding his son and the few of his people who followed him from the distressful event exhaustive to the mind
And We destined his posterity to be the survivors who inhabit the earth
And We praised his name to fame that he be honoured by those to come of future and later generations
Peace be unto Nuh and hailed shall he be with reverential salutations among succeeding generations
For thus do We requite those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety
He was one of Our votaries whose purpose was the heart of Our purpose
And We drowned the others who were at variance with Our system of faith and worship
And among those who followed his doctrine which mirrored Allah's will and His religious principles was Ibrahim
Who presented himself to Allah, his Creator, with a pure, undefiled and sound heart
He questioned the truth of his peoples' system of faith and worship. He said to his father and to his people: "What is it that you worship
Do you choose", he said, "to revere false gods besides Allah, the Creator, and adore them with appropriate acts and rites". Is this what you boldly deem the right path to tread and you insist on brewing falsehood and thinking falsehood
He asked, "What do you think then of Allah Creator of the worlds, past, present and those to come
He took a look and directed his attention to the stars
And there, he exclaimed: "I feel really sick at heart of such irreverent society
They -his people- turned their backs upon him and they went away
Then he turned to their false gods (food was set before them) and asked them, thus: "Do you not eat
Are you mute" he asked "what ails you that you do not talk nor do you say something to the purpose
Secluded from observation he kept striking them right and left with the right hand
But when the damage was noticed, his people came back rushing
And there said Ibrahim to them: "Do you worship the stones and the material you carve with your own hands
When it is Allah Who brought you Into being together with all the elements you use in your handiwork
Offended as they seemed, they decided to get rid of him and so they said: "Build for him a chamber full of combustibles and cast him into the blazing fire
And they thought of contriving against him but We made them the losers who lost the most
And there decided Ibrahim to emigrate? soul and body, spiritually and physically. He said: "I am quitting my home land and will settle where I can best serve Allah, my Creator, Who will guide me to His path of righteousness
And he prayed, thus: "I pray and beseech You O Allah, my Creator, to grace me with a son invested with wisdom and piety
And there, We intimated to him the birth of a son vested with the virtue of patience and with the attribute of nobleness which would teach him forbearance from so foul a wrong
And when the son attained maturity and was able to participate in his father's divine service the father intimated to him his mystical vision. He said: "my son I saw in my dream that I offer you up to Allah as a sacrifice and so, see what you think and what you have to say". But the son said: " O father do what you have been commanded, you shall find me with patience, Allah willing, bearing your act
And when they both had given themselves up to the course of action imposed by Allah and Ibrahim positioned his son's forehead downwards
We forthwith called upon him: "O Ibrahim", We said
Allah's command and your inspired vision have been thus accorded". For thus do We requite those who faithfully and sincerely give up themselves to Allah's command -the redemption by an offerings
This was indeed a severe but a sure test of action and reaction echoing the true belief and the prevalent inclination
And We redeemed him -the son- with a great sacrifice. the slaughter of an animal -the ram- as an offering to Allah
And We praised his name to fame that he be honoured by those to come of future and later generations
Peace be unto Ibrahim from Allah and His angels and from succeeding generations
Thus do We requite those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety
He was one of Our votaries whose purpose was the heart of Our purpose
And We intimated to him the birth of Ishaq (Isaac) who would be chosen as a Prophet invested with wisdom and piety
And We blessed him together with Ishaq. And of their progeny were those whose deeds were imprinted with wisdom and piety as well as those who were wrongful of actions
And We made Our sufficient grace (which renders the soul capable of performing a supernatural act, Allah willing) and Our efficacious grace (which effects the end for which it is given) abound in Mussa and Harun
And We saved them and delivered them together with their people from the distressful event which was really exhaustive to the mind
And We made victory sit on their helm and by consequence were they the victors
And We entrusted them with the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah) of enlightenment and illumination, The Book distinctly expressing all that was meant leaving nothing merely implied
And We guided them to the path of righteousness
And We praised their names to fame that they be honoured by those to come of future and later generations
Peace be unto Mussa and Harun from Allah and His angels and from succeeding generations
For thus do We requite those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety
They were among Our votaries whose purpose was the heart of Our purpose
And Elias (Elijah) whom We chose to be a spectacle and a warning and We entrusted with Our divine message
He urged his people by words to laudable conduct and said to them: "Will you not keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Do you invoke the idol Ba'l (Baal), he asked, "and neglect the Supreme Creator
Who is Allah, your Creator and the Creator of your forefathers
But they counselled deaf and accused him of falsehood and by consequence they shall have much to answer for in Day of Judgement
But excluded from that ill-fate shall be Allah's votaries who were faithful to Him and sincere in mind and spirit
And We praised his name to fame that he be honoured by those to come of future and later generations
Peace be unto Eliaseen -from Allah and His angels- and hailed shall he be with reverential salutations among succeeding generations
For, thus do We requite those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety
He was one of Our votaries whose purpose was the heart of Our purpose
And We chose Lut and We sent him to his people as a spectacle and a warning and entrusted him with Our divine message
We saved him and delivered him together with his family and those of his people who fell into line with him and from the irretrievable disaster
Except an old woman -his wife- who was left behind to perish in the general ruin
And We reduced all the others to a useless form
And you -people- go by their ruined dwellings and you evidence the fatal consequence by day
And you do evidence them also by night and so can you not reflect
And so was Yunus; he was one of Our Messengers whom We entrusted with Our divine message
He withdrew from his people, -with whom he grew impatient- and without Allah's instructions, he hurriedly fled them and went aboard a fully laden ship
He participated in casting lots and the lot fell on him and he was the one rejected and thrown overboard
And there he was swallowed by the fish and it was him who had incurred the blame
Had he not been one of those who in lowliest plight repentant stood and constantly praised Allah and extolled His glorious attributes
He would have remained burried in that grave -the belly of the fish- till Resurrection
And We made the fish regurgitate him in the open on the desert shore feeble and sickly
We caused a tree to grow over him for protection, a tree which grew decumbently and straggingly to a considerable length so as to rest upon the ground (possibly some kind of pumpkin)
And when recovered We sent him as a spectacle and a warning to a people who numbered one hundred thousand or more
And his mission was accepted with the consenting minds of the whole who conformed their will to Allah's will and by consequence We made them enjoy life up to a predetermined point of time
And now ask them -the infidels- O Muhammad and question the truth of their dictum: "Has Allah chosen as they irreverently alleged the females and left for them the males
Or did We create the angels females and they bore witness to their creation and therefore they have ground for their belief
Indeed their perversion of facts and their intentional assertion of falsehood induced them to falsify the words, wittingly, endeavouring to attain their blasphemous and irreverent object, namely
Allah has begotten a son" and make it seem divine which is not. They are indeed pathological liars who lie in their teeth and commit errors at the grossness of which common sense revolts
Did He exercise choice and He preferred daughters to sons
What ails you - people - that you deviate from sense! How could your minds assent to such proposition and induce you to judge and defend this belief
Can you not deviate into sense and turn your thoughts upon the truth
Or do you have a divine authorization to sanction this belief that you speak like a book
(If so) then produce your Sacred Writ that has been issued by Providence if indeed you are declaring the truth
And they -the infidels- go further and fare worse; they ascribe to Him affinity to the Jinn when the Jinn themselves do know that they shall be thronged before Him for Judgement
Glory be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely far above what they ascribe to Him
Excluded are those (of the Jinn and mankind) who are sincere in mind and spirit and free of that intended mischief that is wrought by want of thought
And you -infidels- together with those you revere and adore besides Allah
Shall not be able to influence any to deviate from sense
Except him who has already been justly predestined to suffer the blazes and Hell asserts him as her own
And none of us say the angels but has a place in a certain rank
And the angels add "we draw up ourselves in ranks arranged in even rows to engage in the act of worship and in divine service
And it is We who constantly celebrate the praises of Allah and adore His Eternal Name, express our feelings of warm adoration and extol His glorious attributes
Notwithstanding that before the Prophet's mission there were those* who habited in falsehood and expressed their thoughts in words, thus
Had we received a Book", they said, "like the Scriptures of those of old
We would have been of Allah's votaries who are sincere in mind and spirit
And when the Quran was revealed to them they denied its divine nature and rejected it, but they shall come to know that
However, Our word was already proclaimed beforehand to Our Messengers whom We sent as spectacles and warnings
That they shall certainly be afforded help
And that Our forces shall in the end and at the right time be the winners and victory shall sit on their helm
Therefore keep away from them O Muhammad for a while
But keep a vigilant eye upon them for they will be firm and vigilant, anxious to see what falls to your lot and what can happen to them in this life
Do they wish Our punishment be hastened on as a challenge to the truth of the measure and its wisdom
But when it hits their court-yard, what an evil morning shall it be for those who were warned and counselled deaf
Stay away from them O Muhammad or a while
And keep a vigilant eye upon them for they will be firm and vigilant, anxious to see what falls to your lot and what can happen to them in this life
Glory be to Allah, your Creators the Fountain -Head of glory and honour whose divine and eternal nature exclude Him and absolutely exempt Him from the attributes they ascribe to Him
And peace be extended from Allah and His angels to all Messengers whom He entrusted with His divine message to relate to their people
And by consequence impel -you people- yourselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness and express your praying in words, thus: "Our bosoms surge up and answer thanks to Allah, Creator of the worlds, past, present and those to come
S (Sadd) an Alphabetic letter emblematic of inability to emulation- and by the Quran which
But dissenting from the truth are those infidels who take pride in denying Allah, and their false pride puts them in a state of divided spiritual allegiance and makes them unable to find the concord for their discord
How many generations who came to this world before them did We justly reduce to a useless form! In their distress they cried for mercy and help but that was not the time for either, it was too late
Yet they -the infidels- marvel at the recognition of a man who came to them from their midst to serve as a spectacle and a warning and they refused to accept him in his capacity. Venting their hatred, they say; "He is not only a sorcerer but also a pathological liar
Does He proclaim the gods to be but one god This is indeed strange
And the leaders of falsehood among them walked off the meeting in confusion and exhorted their adherents to remain faithful, constant and firm in fidelity to their gods. "This movement", they said, "has been designed against us and a chism formed to our detriment
We never heard", they said of a like system of faith and worship being practiced by our fathers in this generation." "This is indeed", they continued, "nothing but a made up story and a willful and fraudulent deception
Who would credit" they added, "that of all of us he Muhammad was taken by preference to be entrusted with the divine message!" "The fact is" says Allah. "that they -the infidels- are in doubt of My divine message and they have not yet experienced the taste of My retributive punishment
Or" says Allah, "do they have possession O Muhammad of the vast treasuries of your Creator's mercy, Allah, AL-Aziz (the Almithy) and AL-Wahhab (Who bestows gratuitously)
Or do they have the sovereign authority of the heavens and the earth and of all that lies between them! If so then they are given free vent to their enthusiasm to ascend by the means of their choice or to mount up by ropes (or ladders) to reach the realm of heaven to accomplish their end
They are but some contemptible host already in evil array, a confederacy of Pagan tribes incapable of managing their own affairs, not to mention the affairs of the heavens and the earth; defeat is the synonym of their force, their religion and their immorality
Long before them did people deny the divine message and reject Allah's religious principles, like the people Nuh, of 'Aad (the 'Adites ) and of Pharaoh, king of the immense fixed constructions
And the people of Thamud (the Thamudites), the people of Lut and the Woodlanders (the Midianites), each and all of whom confederated against the truth
Each and all of them confederated their hands and their minds to oppose the Messengers and accused them of falsehood; retribution, was therefore justified
And what do these people -The Qurashites- expect but a single call as loud as the trumpet's blast
And in their insolent challenge, they pray "O Allah, our Creator, let our share of punishment be hastened on before the Day of Judgement
Be patient O Muhammad and put up with what they insolently and defiantly say and apply remembrance to Our worshipper Dawud, the man of physical strength whose vigour and piety joined; he always in lowliest plight repentant stood
We subdued for him the mountains to play the echo to his praises and join him in hymning and ascribing the praises to Allah at night fall and at the break of the day
And the birds were inspired to throng unto him, each and all at his command and each and all to play the echo to his praises of Allah and join him in repenting their temerities; if any
And We strengthened his kingdom and made it strong against attack and stronger in influence, authority and security of position and We imparted to him wisdom and the rules of equity and justice in discourse and passing judgement
In this connection- did you hear O Muhammad of the narrative of the litigants -the disguised angels- the claimant and the defendant who climbed the wall leading to Dawud's private chamber which he had used for religious observances
They came suddenly into the chamber, as though they were an apparition, invading his privacy which occasioned his alarm. But they reassured him and said: "Do not be scared, it is only that We are two litigants one of us has wronged the other. Therefore, We expect you to decide our case with equity and justice and it is hoped that you do not deviate from the path of righteousness and that you will guide us into the path of equity and justice
This is my brother", the claimant said, "who owns ninety nine ewes and I own only one single ewe. He asked me to entrust it to him and commit her to his care and he was rather persuasive
And there said Dawud in his judicial decision. "He, your brother has wronged you indeed by asking you to add your ewe to his ewes and sure enough some of the business partners, and they are many, do wrong their associates except those in whose hearts reigns habitual reverence and obedience to Allah and their deeds reflect wisdom and piety and how few they are". There and then it occurred to Dawud that We had tried him and He invoked Allah, his Creators for forgiveness and fell down with comely prostration of his body expressing repentance. He had listened to the claimant and neglected the defendant
We forgave him this "fall" and He enjoyed endearment and a high station of dignity and distinction in the company of those in Our realm of heaven and excellent shall be his final place of destination
And We advised him, thus: "O Dawud, We inducted you a vicegerent on earth, therefore, judge between people with equity and justice and do not follow a vain desire, nor yield to an overpowering emotion to let passion conquer reason. Such an attitude takes you away from the path of righteousness, the path of Allah. Those who deviate from His path shall suffer the torment laid upon those who have been neglectful of the Day of Judgement
We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in vain as the infidels have thought, they brew falsehood and think falsehood; Woe to them, they shall be the fuel for the fire
Or shall We requite those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety on the same ground as We requite those who play the mischief on earth! or do We requite those in whose hearts reigns piety as We requite those who grow daily more and more wicked
This Quran is a Book We have revealed to you O Muhammad invested with blessings and declaring Allah's benediction and divine favours so that people might ponder its precepts, its signs and revelations and that people of understanding hearts and minds may reflect
We pestowed Dawud with the privilege of begetting Sulayman, an excellent worshipper who in lowliest plight repentant stood
Mustered before him -Sulayman- at eventide for display were coursers of the finest breed which spring and bound in high mettle (they stand on three feet implanted and the fourth lightly touching the ground)
In admiration Sulayman said: "My fondness for the chargers has been an attribute inherent in me due to the vital part they play in Allah's cause and they keep my remembrance applied to Him". He kept admiring them until they disappeared from view behind the curtain and the sun took cover in the veil of night
There did Sulayman give orders, thus: "Bring them back to me, "he said". and he kept patting them on the necks passing his hand over the forenegs expressing fondness and endearment
We decided to try Sulayman like We tried the other Messengers and test his true inclination worldly and spiritually, We seated a phantom on his throne. No sooner did it come to his mind that he was tried than he in lowliest plight repentant stood
He prayed, thus: "I pray and beseech you O Allah, my Creator, to forgive me and to bestow on me a kingdom none else after me will be fit to have; You are in command of the gratuitous blessings of heaven
And there We subdued the wind and We made its activity subservient to his command, it flowed gently to wherever He willed and yielded to his demand
And those among the Jinn characterized with satanic attributes did We also subdue to him comprising every builder and every diver
And others of those satanic bound together with fetters to impose upon them restraint
This, We said, is Our bestowal O Sulayman, you have a free hand, you may give what you will to whom you will and deny whom you will what you will
And he enjoyed endearment and high station of dignity and distinction in the company of those in Our realm of heaven and excellent shall be his final place of destination
And apply remembrance O Muhammad to Our worshipper Ayub. He invoked Allah, his Creator, for mercy, He prayed " O Allah, my Creator, the Devil has caused me much inconvience and pain by suggesting evil thoughts to the minds of the few who adhere to me including my wife
And there We turned to him in mercy for his sincerity and endurance and We said to him: Stamp the ground with the sole of your foot and there you will have a flowing stream of cold water to wash therewith and to drink therefrom
We restored to him his health and vigour causing his family and his people to gather around him again after they had forsaken him and We doubled their original number in mercy from Us and a reminder of Allah's Omnipotence and Mercy to those who endure Allah's test and be able to reflect
And in fulfillment of his oath that he would beat his wife hundred strokes We said to him: Hold in your hand a bunch of a hundred blades of grass and strike her therewith once and gently to avoid breaking your oath. We found him really long suffering to affliction and unwearied in the face of difficulties and hardship. How excellent a worshipper He was and how in lowliest plight did He always repentant stand
And apply remembrance O Muhammad to Our worshippers Ibrahim(Abraham), Ishaq (Isac) and Yaqub (Jacob) who employed their hands in all that was in conformity with Our principles and commands and were people of vision
We endowed them with the prerogative of the attribute that was exclusively claimed by them of applying constant remembrance of the Hereafter and reminding people thereof
And they are among the elect and the select who are held precious in Our esteem and chosen for exalted eternal life
And apply remembrance O Muhammad to Ismail, Elisha and Zul-kifl, each and all are among the chosen for an exalted eternal life
This is an exhortation serving as a reminder of Allah and of His favours. And those who keep in awe of Him and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him must expect a distinguished place in the realm of heaven
Widely open for them shall be the gates of the Gardens of Eden wherein they shall be heartily welcomed
Reclining on dignified thrones they will ask for fruits which are available in plenty: what they see and what they portray in their minds and for the drink of their choice
Accompanied by beautiful women of modest gleaming eyes and radiating splendour, women of a similar stage of life
This is a picture of what you people are promised in Day of Judgement
This is Our provision of victuals, eatables and drinkables, the stores of which will never be exhausted
Contrasted by contrary destination are the transgressors who grow daily more and more wicked. How evil shall be their abode
It is in the abysm of Hell that they shall burn and how evil is the bed they had made for themselves
As for tasting, they shall experience it in the form of a decoction of the offensive suppurating burns boiling hot and/or ice cold
In addition to other decoctions of similar sort
When it is the turn of the leaders of falsehood to be cast into Hell those who preceded them of their people shall be told: "Here is another crowd to join you in the crowd of your sins. They are not welcomed in the beautitude of heaven but Hell claims them as her own
You are not welcomed here either", say those in Hell to the fresh crowd, "You brought this evil destiny upon our heads, therefore evil is the place of your destined end
And in Hell they will add: "O Allah, our Creator would you requite those who brought upon us this misery with double the torment in the abysm of Hell
And in their wonderment they will say: "Why we do not see those men whom We considered men of evil
Did We esteem them men of evil wrongly, and unjustly we laughed them to scorn or have our eyes deviated into the wrong direction
How true is the altercation among the inmates of Hell
Say to them -the infidels- O Muhammad: "You people must realize that I am only a spectacle and a warning and there is no Ilah but Allah; the Creator, the One and only, AL-Wahid (the Unique) and AL-Qahhar (the Supreme and the Irresistible)
Sovereign Supreme and Creator of the heavens and the earth and of all that lies between them, AL-Aziz and AL-Ghaffar (the Forgiving)
Say to them "it is indeed great news symbolized in the divine message sent down to man
A great divine message from which you turn away when it has changed the style of life on earth and the history of all created beings
A Divine message reflecting what has been discussed by The Hierarchy in the realm of heaven and it is quite obvious that "I have no knowledge of it
What is inspired to me indicates precisely that I am only a spectacle and a warning held responsible for the proclamation of Allah's divine message to. each and all
For once did Allah make a proclamation to the angels of a great event. He said: "I am in the process of creating a human from clay
And when I have fashioned* it and furnished it with a definite shape and imparted to it My spirit then do prostrate yourselves to him in reverence and admiration
There and then did all the angels cast themselves down prostrate
Except Iblis AL-Shaytan (Satan-to-be-) who demurred in pride and did not observe Allah's command and was a disobedient rebel
What prompted you Iblis", said Allah, "not to join those who cast themselves down in reverence and admiration to the being I have created with My own hands!" "were you trying to show self esteem and take pride in disobedience, or are you one of those marked as different and recognized as distinct and distinguished
l am a better sort", said Iblis, "You created me from fire whereas You created him from moist earth
Then get out from hence, you are accursed", said Allah
and you are stamped with My curse and consigned to evil until the Day of Judgement
And there, Iblis said: "Then give me respite O Allah, my Creator till the Day they are resurrected
You are granted", said Allah, "like those with characteristics befitting you a delay of punishment
until the predetermined point of time ascertained for judgement
And there swore Iblis, making a solemn declaration with an appeal to Allah saying: "By Your glory and unattainable honour, I will seduce each to and all of them into lust and allure them insiduously
except those of Your worshippers who are sincere and do not consent to temptation
In truth", said Allah, "and I declare the truth
Your disobedience has landed you a great loser and you shall land in Hell; which I will fill with you and with each and all those who fall into line with you
Say to the infidels O Muhammad: "I do not ask you for anything in return nor do I charge you a price nor do I pass myself off as someone other than I am
This is indeed a Quran imparting divine knowledge and guidance to all in and an exhortation neither appendant nor appurtenant to anyone in particular but to people at large here and abroad
And you -people- who refuse to acknowledge it shall come to know in due course the truth of its precepts, its premises and promises and of its revelations the cosmic and the spiritual alike
It -the Quran- is a Book emphatically revealed by Allah in complete glory featuring Him as the guide, and who could be a better guide than Him, AL-Aziz (the Almighty) AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
We have revealed to you; O Muhammad the Book -the Quran- in truth and in agreement with reality, therefore worship Allah devoting to Him alone all religious rites
Is it not in conformity with what is natural, right and just that dedication of the heart of one's purpose should be solemnly and exclusively to serve Allah's purpose! And those who take tutelary guardians besides Him and brew falsehood and think falsehood adduce mediation as a reason: "we only worship them", they say, "so that they intercede on our behalf and bring us close to Him. He shall judge between them in Day of Judgement on matters with which they were at variance. Indeed, Allah does not guide the one who gives himself up to lying and whose heart is barren of truth and gratitude
Had Allah willed to beget, adopt or take a son He would have taken by preference as He willed the best out of those whom He Created. Glory be to Him, He is Allah, AL-Wahid (the Absolute), and AL-Qahhar (the Irresistible)
He created the heavens and the earth and brought them into existence in conformity with truth and in agreement with reality. He causes the earth to describe its orbit round the sun and by consequence He causes the night to move round the day and the day to move round the night performing periodical revolution. And He rendered the sun and the moon subservient, each describing its own orbit for a predetermined point of time, He is indeed AL-Aziz and AL- Ghafur (the Forgiving)
He is it Who brought you all into being from one single soul -Adam-and from him did He, by special creation, evolve his mate Eve* And He supplied you with eight heads of cattle -males and females- (sheep, goats, oxen and camels). He forms you in the wombs within your mothers bellies varying your constitution in stages of development one stage after another (from rudimentary to complete state) in the depth of darkness environed by three superimposed dark compartments This is Allah your Creator, Who has the rightful claim to the sovereign authority, there is no Ilah but Him and so how could you reject Him in favour of other objects of worship
If you -people- deny Allah and/or display ingratitude and ungratefulness to Him instead of being thankful to Him for His favours then you must realize that He is Absolute and totally Independent of you. It does not please Him to see those whom He created in order to worship Him actually deny Him, disobey Him and display ingratitude. Conversely, it pleases Him if you are thankful and your deeds reflect your gratitude. And no sou1 bearing wrongs or not bears in any way the wrong of another and in the end shall all of you return to Him; there and then shall He inform you of all that you had done or left undone He is Alim?n (Omniscient) indeed of all private thoughts and feelings reposited in the bosoms
And when man is touched or befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity he invokes Allah, his Creator, turning to Him exclusively. And when He extends to Him His mercy and grace and delivers him from what is burdensome and exhaustive to the mind he forgets and passes heedless of Allah as though he never invoked Him for relief not long ago; he sets up to Him rivals and incorporates with Him other deities to mislead people from His path of righteousness. Say to them O Muhammad: "Enjoy your infidelity for a while, the pleasure you derive from falsehood is short lived and rest assured that you shall be among those destined to the abode in Hell
Does he who spends a part of the night prostrating his reason to divine revelation and his body comely in worship and submission and his heart and mind in applying remembrance to Allah in standing, bewaring the Hereafter and hopeful of Allah's mercy and blessings compare with him who is heedless of it all! Ask them O Muhammad: "Do they compare, those who apply their minds' eyes and their hearts' ears to the acquisition of learning and by consequence they are well- informed and those who are ignorant of the facts! it is only those who exercise their intellect and lift to Allah their inward sight
Say to them -to the Muslims- "O you people who have conformed to Allah's system of faith and worship: keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and do realize that those whose deeds in this world reflcct wisdom and piety shall be requited, the patient among them, unexpectedly and without measure
Say to them -the infidels- "I have been commanded to worship Allah and to devote to Him alone all religious rites
And I have been commanded to be the first of those who conform to Islam
And say to them: "I am fearful of offending Allah, my Creator, for if I were to disobey Him, heaven shall lay my transgression to my charge and requite me in Day of Judgement with the torment laid upon the damned
Therefore, I say to you; "It is only Allah that I worship and to Him do I lift my inward sight and to Him alone do I dedicate all religious rites
Whereas you are free to worship whom you please or whom you choose besides Him" And say to them: "The big losers in Day of Judgement shall he those who had lost their own souls as well as their own people and evidently shall this be the irretrievable loss
Above them shall there be layers of flames of fire hanging over them like a canopy of perpetual clouds of fire and no less shall there be underneath them. This is a picture Allah uses to caution those who worship Him, as well as those who do not, against the inevitable and He exhorts them, thus: "O you people who should seek unto Me, keep in awe of Me and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Me
And those who avoid submission to an entity animate or inanimate other than Allah and do not take it as an object of worship and do not brew falsehood and in lowliest plight repentant stand must expect Allah's intimation of joyful tidings and therefore announce to My worshippers O Muhammad the good news
My worshippers who listen to the discourse and choose with deliberation the best course to follow as of forgiveness in lieu of retaliation. These are they who have the world all before them and Providence their guide and it is these who apprehend virtue as well as the voice from heaven
Can he whom Allah has justly destined to the abode in Hell escape his destiny! would you be able, O Muhammad to rescue anyone imprisoned in the fire
But those who keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him are destined to take their abode in paradise in beautifully designed chambers superimposed by chambers in luxuriously built mansions beneath which rivers flow, a declaration made to them by Allah Who never breaks a promise
Are you -people- not able to see that Allah is He Who sends down the rain water from the floor of the vault of heaven and directs its course through the earth to form springs and water channels and by its means He produces plants variegated or varied in colour. Later on they lose their bloom and their natural colour. then you see them turning yellow and drying up and they shrivel and decay, a process servimg as a reminder of Allah's infinite influence and Omnipotence to those who reflect
Will he not be secure, he whom Allah has delighted his heart with Islam and accorded the seat of his thoughts and feelings with its principles, and Providence his guide and his source of illumination and enlightenment! Woe betide the hard-hearted who counsel deaf to exhortation and will not apply remembrance to Allah. These are they who are lost in the maze of error
In complete glory did Allah reveal the best discourse -the Quran, a Book conformable in its various parts, a Book that both illustrates and ennobles the subject and imparts cognition and belief which in act evoke a quiver of the skins of those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah their Creator, then it accords peace of the soul and the mind conducing their hearts to their settled calmness and their skins to softness at the thought of Allah. This is the spirit of truth whereby Allah guides whom He will into all truth. And he whom Allah gives enough rope and leaves to deviate from sense and from the path of righteousness never will he find any one to guide him thereto
Does he who has no other means but his face to fight hopelessly the torture of the blazes in Day of Judgement compare with him in whose heart had reigned piety!. There and then shall the wrongful of actions be told: Taste -you infidels- the torment in requital of setting yourselves against Allah and of your evil which was wrought by want of thought
Similarly behaved those who preceded them and they were seized with a ruinous punishment they neither knew how it happened nor whence it came
And there did Allah make them suffer shame, dishonour and disgrace in life below and worse shall be the suffering Hereafter if only they knew
And We have given in this Quran examples of typical instances that form particular cases of principle, rule and state of things, examples illustrating qualities and signal instances of punishment action and conduct inducing imitation, as well as examples of persons whose fate serves as a deterrent. and We have discoursed in parables and in similitude that people may hopefully reflect
A Quran revealed in the Arabic literary form, well founded, constant and resolute, a Quran that does not allow in its structure declension, obliquity or crookedness so that they -people- may hopefully keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Allah cites an instance of a man -a slave- who serves many masters who are quarrelsome and unable to find the concord for their perpetual discord, consequently, he is perplexed and at a loss. And another slave who serves only one master and by consequence he has peace of mind and he knows what pleases and what displeases his master and proceeds accordingly. Do they compare! yet most people do not realize this fact
You Muhammad are destined to die and so are they
And in Day of Judgement shall all of you contend before Allah with opposing arguments and among yourselves shall you altercate
And who is more wrongful of actions than he who viciously and cheaply relates to Allah falsehood and dismisses the truth when presented to him! But is there not enough room in Hell to accommodate all those who deny Allah and/or reject or disobey His statutes
And he who has conveyed the divine message of truth to the people as well as to those who are convinced of its conformity with fact and use it to exhort others to what is good, laudable and divine are those who keep in awe of Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Allah's grace shall abound in them and they shall be privileged with divine dispensations; they shall have what they will in the realm of heaven, for this is the requital reaped by those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety
Allah will remit them their deeds of an evil savour and blot out their worst deeds and requite them for every regular deed at the gauge of the best of what they had accomplished
Is Allah not enough to satisfy His worshipper's needs of defense, protection and necessities of life! They -the pagans- caution you O Muhammad; against coming within the measure of their gods' wrath. In reality, he whom Allah justly sends astray shall find no one to guide him to the path of righteousness
And he whom Allah guides to His path no one can influence him to deviate from sense or lead him astray. Is Allah not Aziz?n (Almighty) and Able to avenge His right
And if you should ask them -the infidels- O Muhammad as to who has created the heavens and the earth, they will say: "Allah", then say to them: "Do you see those whom or which you invoke besides Allah, will they be able to protect me should Allah decide to do me harm or relieve me from what is burdensome and exhaustive to the mind! Or if He means to extend to me His mercy and blessings, can they obstruct the flow of His mercy or be able to withhold it! Say to them: "Enough is Allah for me, in Him do I find the answer to my purpose, my hopes and my needs, and in Him trust those who entrust to Him themselves and their affairs
Say to them: "O you people who are sunk under the vexations of thoughtless minds, you may pursue what your minds and souls impel you to do, I am steering my course of action by guiding principles set by Providence Who guides into all truth. You shall come to know who shall be the winner of Allah's mercy and successful in attaining the blissful end
And you shall know who has been destined to receive the blow which will put him to shame and incense him with multiple humiliations and to suffer the everlasting retributive punishment
We have revealed to you O Muhammad the Book -the Quran- to relate its context of truth to the people in truth, and he who accepts the spirit of truth guiding into all truth will have profited his own soul and he who deviates into falsehood will have hurt himself. "And you O Muhammad are not there to watch over their innocence and folly
Allah disembodies the souls at the time of physical death and during physiological sleep. He detains the soul whose body is destined to die during sleep and sends back the other to embody its material being for a predetermined point of time, a phenomenon and a process highly indicative of Allah's Omnipotence and Mysterious controlling power for those who exercise their intellect and do reflect
Or do they -the infidels- take besides Allah other gods to intercede on their behalf in Day of Judgement, even though they are destitute of power as well as of the rational faculty which is Allah's given gift
Say to them: "To Allah alone belongs the command of permitting intercession by whom He will on behalf of whom He will. And it is only to Him that the absolute sovereignty of the heavens and the earth belongs, and in the end shall all of you return to Him
And when the Name of Allah alone is mentioned those who deny the Hereafter grow peevish and their hearts come to be filled with aversion or disgust reflected on their countenances, whereas when other objects of worship -their false gods- are referred to, they rejoice beyond a common Joy
Say O Muhammad in your prayer: O Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Omniscient of the invisible and the unknown as well as of the evident and the known, You shall sit in judgement and judge between Your people the worshippers and the non worshippers You will give decisions on matters of variance and on religious matters which created among them an age of dissension and discord
And if it so happens that the wrongful of actions were to own the worldly riches and the affluence treasured on earth and as much of the same, they shall be glad to offer it in Day of Judgement in expiation of their guilt and of the inseparable torment laid upon the damned. They shall be faced with what they never expected would happen but Allah has brought it all to light and they now realized that their hopes have been doomed to disappointment
And there shall the evil deeds they had committed confront them personified, and they shall be beset on all side by the same material and immaterial things they had turned in to ridicule
And when man is touched or befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity he invokes Us for relief, and when We extend to him a divine favour from the realm of heaven he says in response: "I have acquired what comes into my possession by reason of the knowledge inherent in me and for my intellectual acquaintance with fact". In effect, what We bestowed upon him, of favour and prospering influence, was simply a test of his true inclination but most of them fail to realize this fact
In a similar manner did those who preceded them reveal their true character but nothing they had done or left undone and nothing they had accomplished in their own irreverent way was of any advantage to them nor did it accomplish their purpose nor did it protect them from Allah's retributive punishment
And in consequence did the evil line of conduct they committed themselves to and the evil deeds they conferred on themselves spring back and recoil on them. And similarly shall the evil deeds of the wrongful among those of the present and those to come spring back and recoil on them and they, these and those, are not in a position to overpower Allah or upset His plan
Do they -the infidels- not know that Allah is He Who gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously on whom He will and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will! Indeed, there are in this presentation enough signs symbolic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, signs conducing contemplation by those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand
Quote to them O Muhammad what Allah says: "O My people Who worship Me and Who do not, who have carried disobedience to excess: do not despair of Allah's mercy; Allah forgives all sins; He is AL-Gaff?r and AL-Rahim
Therefore do not miss you people the path of righteousness and stand penitent to Allah, your Creator, with the intention to amend your wrong-doings and to prostrate your reason to divine revelation before you are confronted with the retributive punishment and no one can defend you or afford you help
And follow the best course best discoursed by Allah, your Creator, in the Quran which rounds off all precepts in all aspects; before you are suddenly confronted with the retributive punishment; you will neither know how it happened nor whence it came
A sinful soul would then express regrets in words, thus: "Woe to me for what I neglected of the duties owed to Allah and woe to me for disregarding His noble discourse I had turned in to ridicule
Or it would say "Had Allah guided me to His path I would have been among those who revered Him and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Or it might say when faced with the torment laid upon the damned: "If only I could be given the chance to relive my life again down below so that I prostrate my reason to divine revelation and be among those who perfect their illustrious toils and turn their thoughts on moral excellence and benevolence and imprint their deeds with wisdom and piety
Such person shall be told: But there came to you My revelations which were related to you by My Messengers and My signs evincing both My Omnipotence and My divine nature, you rejected them and regarded them as the synonym for falsehood and your pride got the better of your prudence, you displayed inordinate self- esteem and were a disobedient rebel
And in Day of Judgement you shall see the faces of those who related falsehood to Allah how they will assume blackness expressive of the terror falling upon them. Is there not enough room in Hell to accommodate all those extravagant in their accounts of themselves and addicted to inordinate self- esteem
Allah shall save those in whose hearts reigned dread mingled with veneration and deliver them to safety for their merit and never shall they come to grief
Allah is He Who created every entity existing individually in fact or in idea and that which is or may be in any way an object of perception, knowledge or thought and He is the Tutelary Guardian of the whole and of all in all
To Him is attributed the authority and control over the known and the unknown and the mysterious schemes and systems which hold and structure together in harmonic relations and all that exists in the heavens and on earth. And He has the keys serving to open up, disclose and explain the unknown, the mysterious and the obscure. And those who denied Allah's signs and revelations shall occasion the eternal damnation; these are they who shall suffer the heaviest losses
Say to them -the infidels- O Muhammad: Do you enjoin me -you people- who are destitute of knowledge and whose ignorance and irreverence have reached up into heaven, to worship anyone other than Allah the Creator of the universe
We have actuated you O Muhammad as We actuated those Messengers sent before you with the feeling of caution against incorporating with Allah other deities, for if you do you will be denied the prerogative of Prophethood besides the loss you will incur and your hopes will be doomed to disappointment and your deeds to worthlessness
Do not pay attention to the infidels' irreverent exhortation. It is only Allah Whom you are enjoined to worship and be among those who impel themselves to the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness
And they* have not credited Allah with the attributes asserted as His own and they fail to ponder His marvels crediting His Omnipotence. which they shall realize in Day of Judgement. The earth with all its contents shall be under His command and His control as though it were an object firmly grasped with the fist and the heavens folded in His right hand. Praise be to Him and extolled are His glorious attributes. He is infinitely beyond all those they incorporate with Him
The trumpet will be blown and sounded emitting so violent penetrating, shocking and thunderous blast proclaiming the Final Event so as to overwhelm all those in the heavens and on earth who shall be stunned into unconsciousness save those whom Allah excepts as He will. Next will follow a Second blast and there, they are all up upon their feet looking around
There and then the earth will be flood-lit with its Creator's indescribable bright, shining and splendent light and the archetypal Book of all records is laid wide open and all the Prophets and the witnesses will be brought up to the August and Ultimate Judicial sitting and the divine sentences are being decided with equity and truth and no one shall ever be wronged
And there, will each soul have been requited with what is commensurate with its deeds and Allah knows best what each has done or left undone
And then will the infidels and those who incorporated with Allah other deities be herded in throngs to the abysm of Hell. And when they have reached its gates they are swung open in Allah's Name, and there, shall the guards receive them with a reproach unto their infidelity, thus: "Did you not -you infidels-" say the angels, "receive Messengers chosen from your midst to recite to you the divine revelations revealed by Allah, your Creator, and warn you of this Eventful Day of Judgement!" "Indeed they did", say the infidels. " "But", the angels say", "Allah's word proclaimed beforehand is now being realized" the infidels were born to be the inmates of Hell
And there, they are told: "Make entry -you infidels- into the gates of Hell to take your permanent abode in its abysm. Evil indeed is the abode of those who were addicted to disobedience and to inordinate self-esteem
And led to Paradise in crowds are those who remained in awe of Allah, their Creator, and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him. When they have reached its gates which are now laid open in the Name of Allah they are received by its guards with heartily welcome and expressions of good-will, thus: "Peace be upon you Allah's devotees," the guards say, "well done, make entry, you have already passed through nature to Eternity
Having now obtained the ultimate of their desires, those admitted to Paradise will say: "Our bosoms surge and answer thanks to Allah to Whom we extol the glorious attributes for the fulfillment of His promise at the time He saw fit; He conferred on us the heritage of the Paradisiacal and the supremely blest land to occupy any part as we will" How excellent is the reward of those who exert themselves for a truthful end and the heart of their purpose be Allah's purpose
And you see the angels standing to attention around the Supreme throne celebrating the praises of Allah and extolling His glorious attributes. And judicial decision has already been given with equity, truth and justice on all matters of fact bearing upon each and all. And to draw to a conclusion shall the material anal the immaterial, the animate and the inanimate sing the praises of Allah and extol His glorious attributes expressing their gratitude in words, thus: "We are indeed, grateful to Allah Creator of the worlds and of the whole and of all in all
(Ha) M. (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran though written in the people's tongue cannot he emulated
This is a disclosure of knowledge, wisdom and guidance proceeding from Allah, AL-Aziz (the Almighty) And AL-Alim (the Omniscient), in the form of a Book
Who gives up claim to requital for a violation of a religious or a moral principle, Who accepts penitence of those who in lowliest plight repentant stood, Who also justly strikes at the root or foundation tending to the utter destruction, Who has the rightful claim to Omnipotence; No Ilah there is but He; He is the end and the purpose for which all are destined
No one contends with opposing argument against Allah's signs and revelations and seem resolved to dispute the truth but those who deny Him and refuse to acknowledge His authority, and so let not their prosperous commercial travels befool your mind. O Muhammad nor delude your judgement
In order of time there were the people of Nuh (Noah) who declared Our message to be false followed by those who confederated their wits against the truth and each of them lied schemes for their Messenger to reduce him into impotence and they contended with opposing argument to confute the truth; and there I cast them down from a position of prosperity and power and brought them to ruin and how unbearable was the retribution
Thus was Allah's word proclaimed beforehand against those who denied His Authority, realized in actual experience; that they were born to be the inmates of Hell fire
Those angels who Carry the Supreme Throne and those around it in heaven's realm praise Allah and extol His glorious attributes and acknowledge His Godhead, His supremacy and Omnipotence and invoke His forgiveness for those who believed with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, They express their invocation, thus: "O Allah, our Creator, Your mercy is extended to the wide circle of the all, and Omniscience is claimed as your own; O Allah, forgive those who in lowliest plight repentant stood and adhered to Your path of righteousness, and ensure them immunity from the dreadful conflagration of Hell fire
O Allah, our Creator, and admit them into the blissful gardens of Eden of promise to them and to those of their parents, their partners in marriage and their progeny who lifted to You their inward sight, You are AL-Aziz And AL- Hakim, (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
And free them from the censures of the evil consequences of their deeds in life and make them void; for he whom You do not censure for his evil deeds then, You will have conferred Your mercy on him, and this is indeed triumph supreme
Those who denied Allah and refused to acknowledge His Authority shall be called upon Hereafter to listen to the proclamation: "Allah hatred to you is far greater than your present natural aversions and antipathies among yourselves; aversions actuated now by the status quo which you face resolutely, you brought upon yourselves by the evil incitation in life to counsel deaf to Allah's message
They shall say: " O Allah, our Creator, twice did you deprive us of animate existence by death and twice did you bring us into being and caused us to exist, and now we confess our sins and confess to the charge, but is there a way out of this agony and torment
They are told: "This is, in requital of the way you conducted yourselves in life; when Allah alone was invoked you rejected the idea as groundless fiction and you fixed your attention on the negative aspect of your belief, and when other objects of worship were added to Him portraying a corporate deity you accepted the idea, and the thought sweetly crept into your study of imagination. But judgment and judicial decision rest in His hands; He is the Unique Whose attributes belong to the highest regions of thought and reality; the Unique Who is eminently entitled to the designation: The Supreme
He is it Who exhibits to you His signs, His marvels and revelations and sends down to you from His realm His divine influence and efficacious grace free and unmerited, and from the floor of the vault of heaven rainfall*, the intermediary agent or instrument of sustaining life and providing livelihood; but no one reflects except those who lift to Him their inward sight *see v.164c2 - v5,c45and commentary
Therefore dedicate the heart of your purpose solemnly to Allah and reverence Him exclusively albeit this be hateful to those who devote their purpose to a corporate deity and refuse to acknowledge Allah's Oneness; Uniqueness and Authority
He is Allah Who has the rightful claim to the position of supremacy and the highest power and authority; He is it Who occupies the glorious Throne and sends the Spirit at will on whom of His servants He wills and induces him to caution all against the Day when all shall assemble for Judgment
The Day when they are fully exposed within and without and none of their aspects or secrets bearing reference to the way they conducted themselves in life, is but to Allah fully disclosed. There and then to whom belong the domination and the supreme controlling power and absolute and independent authority but to Allah, AL-Wahid and AL-Gahhar the One and only and the All Powering
In that Day-of Judgement- shall every soul be requited with what is commensurate with its qualities and its deeds. Judgement, then, is an expression of absolute justice and vindication of right by assignment of reward or punishment; and Allah is indeed swift in putting the law in executions
Caution them O Muhammad; against the approaching Day of Resurrection when the hearts sink, choking the breath, the tongue and the utterance, connoting extreme fear disabling them to put their thoughts into words; there and then shall they find no friend nor an intercessor whose mediation is accepted
Allah knows the Obliquity of the eye and what the bosoms conceal of thoughts and feelings
And Allah exercises His Authority in the maintenance and the vindication of right and He requites each according to his deserts whereas those whom they invoke besides Him are incapable of administering right or justice; indeed Allah is AL-Sami (with unlimited audition), and AL-Bassir (the Vigilant Who sees all things)
Have they not journeyed through the land and looked with their minds' eyes to see what was the end of those who preceded them, who were far mightier and whose diligence never wearied, They left more material indicating prosecution with activity anal perseverance; but Allah seized them with a calamity and reduced them into a useless form in requital of their iniquities, and no tutelary did they have to protect them from Him
A penalty imposed on them in the train of their malicious refusal of the clear evidence of His Omnipotence and Authority presented to them by their Messengers, and in conscience did He seize them with a calamity and reduce them into a useless form; He is indeed Omnipotent, He punishes severely
To this effect I may example My Omnipotence and Authority by a brief account of Mussa (Moses) whom We sent equipped with Signs, serving to demonstrate divine power ant authority
He was sent to I'haraoh, Haman and Qaroon who called him a necromancer skilled in magic and a great liar
And when he presented them with tile truth from heaven's realm, the truth evincing both the truth of his mission and that of his message, they decided to take vengeance on those whom they considered deluded wretches, and so they proclaimed: "Slay the progeny of those who fell with him into line and spare their women". But the plan devised by those who refuse to acknowledge Allah attains no end
And Pharaoh added "Allow me to kill Mussa and let him invoke Allah, his Creators to deliver him out of my hands; I fear he might induce you to change religions or cause dissension and discord to spring in thc land
Mussa said: "I have committed myself to Allah, my Creator, and your Creator, counter to every one who is unjustly extravagant in his account of himself and refuses, with inordinate self-esteem, to acknowledge the Day of Judgment
And there said a man of pharaonic parents, whose heart had been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues but had hidden his faith: Will you slay a man just because he says "The One object of supreme adoration and the end and the purpose for which I am destined is Allah, my Creator. And he has already bought you clear evidence demonstrating Allah's Omnipotence and Authority and brings you to your senses! And if he happens to be lying and conveying a false impression he will only much hurt himself and his interest and the fault will be at his own door But if what he says is in conformity with truth and in agreement with reality then you shall be wed to some of the calamities he has promised you anal you will have brought suffering upon yourselves". Allah certainly does not guide to His path of righteousness any one who goes beyond just and prescribed limits and lies in his teeth
O my people" he added " today you have the sovereignty the dominion and the authority and you have acquired supremacy and pre-eminence and you are the mighty ones yet, but who would save us from Allah if we come within the measure of His wrath? "Pharaoh said: '' I only expose you to harmonious influences and what seems to me appropriate and befitting ,nor do I guide you but to the path of righteousness
Then said he whose heart had been touched with the divine hand :"O people :I have an uneasy sense of the probability of a misfortune which might befall you on an unlucky day, the like of the day of those who confederated their wits against their Messengers
like the manner of acting of the people of Nuh, and those of 'Ad, the 'Adites, and Thamud, -the Thamudites - and those who succeeded them whose disposition denoted indifference and unconcern, yet Allah means no injustice to His servants
O people", he added, "I fear for you the Day of discourse and interchange of thoughts and words
The Day you shall turn your backs and in vain try to flee, for you have no tutelary to protect you from Allah; and he whom Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness shall find no one to guide him thereto
And before Mussa, came Yusuf (Joseph) who was sent to you with clear evidence of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, but you remained in a state of uncertainty as to the truth and reality of what he presented to you. And when he died you claimed that never shall Allah send after him another Messenger; thus does Allah neglect him who is extravagant in his account of himself, who is doubtful of the truth and He leaves him to wander from His path of righteousness
Those who contend with opposing argument against Our signs and seem resolved to dispute the truth of Our revelations without being furnished with proof, occasion Allah's strong disgust as well as the strong repugnance of those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues; Such objectionable disposition does Allah imprint on the heart of every extravagant in his account of himself, shackled with tyranny
And Pharaoh said to his grand vizier: "O Haman: erect for me a lofty building soaring skyward; I may find the means of attaining my objective
The means to get to the heaven's realm where I may meet and converse with the Allah of Mussa to prove my point that Mussa, as I think, is indeed a liar. "And thus was Pharaoh enticed by his deeds of evil and iniquity alluring his mind's eyes and inducing him to hug his irreverent conviction to his heart and was swayed from the path of righteousness, The plan devised by Pharaoh attained no end but only a ruthless destiny
Then said he whose heart had been touched with the divine hand: "O people: follow me and keep up with my train of thoughts; I will lead you to the path of righteousness
O people" he added, "life here is but an evanescent and ephemeral enjoyment, whereas the Hereafter is indeed the settled eternal abode
He who willfully violates a religious or a moral principle shall not be requited but with the like thereof, and he or she whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety shall he welcomed into gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty wherein they are provided for without measure
O people" he said, "how is it that I invite you to the deliverance from sin and the admission to eternal bliss and you invite me to the fire of Hell
In effect you present me with inducement to deny Allah and incorporate with Him other deities of whom I have no mental apprehension and to know them, is simply to acquire abundance of empty and unprofitable knowledge, whereas I invite you to AL-Aziz (the Olmighty) and AL-Ghaffar (the Forgiving)
Indeed, the object of worship you ask me to reverence, and make obeisance to has no assertion of any right here or Hereafter, and our return shall be due to Allah. And those who are extravagant in their accounts of themselves are the inmates of the fire of Hell
One day you shall recall to the mind all that I have expressed to you in words, and as for me, I commit my purpose to Allah. He is indeed the vigilant who keeps a watchful eye upon His creation and upon the way they conduct themselves in life
In consequence did Allah ensure him immunity from the evil consequences of their cunning and their skilful deceit, whereas these people headed by Pharaoh were beset on all sides with torturing punishment
Exposed to the fire shall their souls be, morning and evening, (the interim between death and Resurrection) and when a point in the course of time is marked by the Eventful Hour of Judgement, the command is issued thus: "Enter Pharaoh and his people into the pit of Hell and submit them to the maximum punishment
There and then shall all the inmates of Hell interchange altercating words and hold angry discourse and thus say the weak who lacked strength of purpose and will to those who were extravagant in their accounts of themselves "We were your followers: are you now going to carry on our behalf a share of this burdensome infernal afflictions
And there shall say those who were extravagant in their accounts of themselves "we are now all within it Allah has already judged between His servants, bad men and angels
And there shall the inmates of Hell say to the sentinels who keep guard: "Would you invoke Allah your Creator to ease our anguish and torture just for one day
Did your Messengers," shall say the sentinels, "not present to you clear signs and expounded revelations demonstrating Allah's Omnipotence and Authority His Oneness and Uniqueness, His Omnipresence and Omniscience?" "Indeed they did" they, shall say then the sentinels shall say, "you may invoke Allah as long as you want; it is only that invocations voiced by those who deny Him is as vain as it attains no end
Indeed and as a matter of certainty, We will make victory Sit on Our Messengers helm and on the helm of those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, both here and, on the Day when the Messengers, the actions , the faculties and the senses are called as witnesses
The day when of no avail shall be an excuse or a plea in justification of deeds of iniquity advanced by the wrongful of actions. They have come within the measure of Allah's curse, and the worst of it is their destined abode and their heritage in hell
In order of time, We sent to Mussa the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and We made Bani-Israel (the Children of Israel) the inheritors of the Book
Guiding into all truth and an admonition apprehended by those who open their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and lift to Allah their inward sight
Therefore, be patient O Muhammad and bear with them their faults and limitations; the promise of Allah, your Creator, is the truth personified. Invoke Allah's forgiveness for any instance where you went short of a standard or showed apprehension, and praise Allah, your Creator, in acknowledgement of His Divine favours and extol His glorious attributes evening and morning
Those who contend with opposing arguments against Allah's signs and seem resolved to dispute the truth of His revelations without being endowed with authority, simply vent their feelings overflowing with the sense of pride and inordinate self-esteem but attaining no end. Therefore, commit yourself O Muhammad, to Allah counter to their falsehood. He is AL-Sami’ (with unlimited audition), and AL-Bassir (the vigilant who sees all things)
In effect the creation* of the heavens and the earth and bringing them into being involve a far greater work than that involved in the creation of mankind and bringing them into being, but most people are not aware of this fact
Nor does the one who lacks intellectual and spiritual perception compare with him who perceives the truth mentally and lifts to Allah his inward sight, nor do those whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety compare with those whose works are tinted with evil. How little do you people reflect
As to the predetermined Eventful Hour of Judgement, It shall unquestionably come to pass but most people refuse to give credence to the statement and they hold the event as untrue
Invoke Me," says Allah, your Creator, "I respond to your invocation." "Meanwhile those who are too proud to pay reverence to Me and do not display adoration with appropriate acts and rites, shall take up their abode in Hell, plunged into infamy and humiliation
Allah is He Who designated for you a period of darkness -the night- to take your natural repose and recuperate, and a period filled with light. the day- to have a clear perception of things and acquire experience of the activities of human existences. Indeed Allah's efficacious grace abounds in people but most of them show no gratitude
This is Allah, your Creator, Who created all things and brought them into being and caused them to exist. there is no Ilah but Him yet how strongly deluded they are that they believe a lie
Thus in like manner were deluded those who came before you, who refused to acknowledge Our Revelations and Authority; they befooled their minds and their judgement of the truth so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true
Allah is He Who set for you the earth at creation in the order of a settled habitation where you establish your abode and made the heaven, with its regions, spheres, celestial bodies and realms of space, a construction of imposing magnitude. He gave you form and He shaped you and how shapely He fashioned you and He provided you with victuals of the various good and wholesome kinds of provisions; this is Allah, your Creator, blessed be He and praise be to Him Who has the glorious attributes, the Creator of the universe
He is the Eternal; there is no Ilah but Him, therefore invoke Him paying reverence, devoting your religious observance with appropriate acts and rites exclusively to Him. Praise be to Allah the Creator of the universe, in acknowledgement of His divine favours
Say to them, O Muhammad: "I have been forbidden to pay reverence to those whom you Invoke besides Him ever since I acquired the divine knowledge featured in the clear signs and the expounded revelations, and there I have been commanded to submit to Him, Creator of the universe
He is it Who raised you, by special creation from dust, then He made you evolve from a constituent part of emitted fluid, then from a clinging organism, then He disburdens the wombs of you as a new born babe. You grow to maturity, then you are carried through the stealing steps of age to advanced life. And among you is he who encounters death earlier, and you are destined to live on to a predetermined age that you may hopefully reflect
It is He who gives life and inspirits the property of animate existence, and He occasions death and deprives of animate existence, and when He determines to bring anything into being, He simply says: "Be" and it is
Have you not seen O Muhammad those who contend with opposing arguments against Allah's signs and seem resolved to dispute the truth of His revelations, how they turn a deaf ear and refuse to listen but to their own conception; an imagination proceeding from their deviating senses
These and such persons of future generations and of times past together with the present, who refuse to acknowledge the Book -the Quran- and the spirit of truth We conferred on Our Messengers who were sent before to guide people into all truth, shall come to know and experience the fatal consequence of their denial of Allah's Authority
When in time they shall bear the yoke and be dragged in chains
Plunged into boilers and from thence into Hell where they suffer torment
There and then they shall be asked: "Where are those whom you incorporated with Allah and invoked in accession To Him
They shall say: "They have vanished away." And they add, " in effect it is quite evident that we conceived the absent to be present and we reverenced and entertained imagination." And thus does Allah neglect those infidels who deserve ill
This train of evils you people drew after yourselves is in requital of the pleasure you unjustly derived from the early religion of sensuous character and because of your insolence to make people the instrument of your evil ambition
Now enter into the gates of Hell. the kingdom of eternal suffering, where you bewail your lot. Evil indeed is the abode of those who are extravagant in their accounts of themselves
Therefore in patience O Muhammad you possess your soul; the promise of Allah, your Creator, is the absolute truth. We either show you, in your life time, some part of the retributive punishment We have promised them, or cause you to die before you witness this punishment, then to Us they are destined to return
Before you O Muhammad We sent Messengers to their people, some of whom We mentioned and narrated to you their stories and some we did not relate to you their account, nor was it ever in the power of any Messenger to display an act of a miraculous nature but through Allah's instrumentality and authorization. And when His command comes to pass, here or Hereafter. judgement is conducted in equity and justice. There and then shall the loss fall on those given to intentional assertion of what is false
Allah is He Who domesticated for you cattle to hold as property and rear them to ride on some and some would serve as food
This is besides other benefits you advantage yourselves of and to effect what your emotions are directed to its attainment, and upon their backs and on board ships you are carried
And other signs, revelations and marvels does He exhibit to you displaying His Omnipotence and Authority; so which of His signs will you deny
Have they not journeyed through the land and looked with their minds' eyes to see the fatal consequence of those who preceded them, who were mightier by force of numbers and far mightier in power and their diligence never wearied! They left more material indicating prosecution with activity and perseverance. Yet all the advantages they availed themselves of did not afford them help nor did they serve their purpose
And when their Messengers brought them the clear and plain revelations guiding out of darkness and superstition of later times and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment, they rejected the good counsel. They favoured what enriched their bosoms of worldly knowledge which satisfied their desires and made them rejoice beyond a common joy. And so, on all sides are they beset by the same material and immaterial things they had turned in to ridicule
And when they encountered and experienced Our severe punishment, it was only then that they declared: "We believe in Allah alone, and we deny all the deities which we incorporated with Him
But their submission to Allah, then and their acknowledgment of His Godhead when they saw His severe punishment befalling them precluded forgiveness; a mode of action adopted by Allah and has long been pursued. The loss, then, falls on those who deny Him
(Ha), M; (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though 4sf.itten in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
A Book - a Quran - a Revelation, disclosed by Allah, AL- Rahaman and AL-Rahim
A Book whose veritable revelations have been expounded and made plain, a Quran in the Arabic literary form disclosed to a people who comprehend the truth
A book announcing blissful tidings to those who lift to Allah their inward sight, and intimates a cautionary advice against the denial of Allah and the disregard of the profound reverence dutiful to Him .Yet most of them deflect from the thought and turn a deaf ear
And they say: "Our hearts O Muhammad are shielded against what you induce us to accept as a matter of fact, and our ears are deaf and in fact you might say there is a screen interposed between us and you, and so, you just proceed as you have begun; we are doing what we will
Say to them: " I am only a human like you. Nonetheless, I am being inspired by Heaven that Allah, your Creator, is One and only Ilah; make Him, then, the heart of your purpose and invoke His forgiveness; Woe betide those who incorporate with Him other deities
who deny the needy their dutiful alms and refuse to acknowledge the truth of the Hereafter
But those who believed, with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds of wisdom and piety, shall rejoice at the unceasing blissful reward
Say to them the –unbelievers-: "In effect you do deny Allah who created the earth in two days, determined by His own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar, and you incorporate with Him other deities when He is Allah, the Creator of the universe and of all beings
And He placed therein, in a certain setting, natural elevations* of the earth's surface rising notably above the surrounding level and fixed as with an anchor for stabilization, and He blessed it with His divine favour and He determined its livelihood and the means of sustaining life in four days of the same unit of time and made the sustenance available for all alike who seek His bounty
Then He applied himself to the immeasurable expanse of the realm when it was in its primordial gaseous and dusty** or smoky** state and He commanded both the realm and the primordial earth thus: " Come within My authority willingly or unwillingly": they both responded , thus: "We both come actuated with unconditional obedience to Allah's command
Then He set them in order and arranged them in seven heavens in two days of the same unit of time and designated to each heaven its destined purpose " and We decorated the lowermost heaven with lamps or heavenly bodies and to keep guard; a plan determined by AL-Aziz and AL-Alim (the almighty and the Omniscient)
Should they -the unbelievers- as yet turn away and counsel deaf, then say to them: "I warn you of an injurious rout tempest like the thunderbolt which overtook the 'Adites and the Thamudites
Their Messengers, who were spectacles and warnings, approached them from every angle and left no stone unturned advising them to worship no one but Allah, but they counselled deaf and said: "Had Allah, our Creator, willed us to discern divine truths, He would have sent down angels; therefore we utterly refuse to acknowledge your messages
As to 'Ad (the 'Adites) who were unjustly extravagant in their accounts of themselves; they counselled deaf and, with inordinate self-esteem insolently said: "Who is greater than us in power; we are the mighty ones yet". Do they not see that Allah Who created them is infinitely greater in power and far mightier than they are and they continued to reject Our revelations
And so We drove against them, on some unlucky and miserable days, a fiercely cold wind swallowing the ground with fierceness and rage, vehement, merciless, roaring for vengeance, avenging wrong and punishing crime so as to taste the suffering of disgrace and multiple humiliations in life, and worse shall be the suffering Hereafter, and no one, then, can fiord them help
But as to Thamud -The Thamudites-, they preferred to close their minds' eyes than to open their hearts' ears and lift to Allah their inward sight, and so they were seized by a thunderbolt stunning them with disgrace and humiliation in requital of their deeds of iniquity
And We saved those whose hearts were impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and had entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
The Day Allah's enemies are forced to move on in throngs toward Hell, then those in the foremost lines are stopped until those in the rear catch up
And when they have all reached the intended end, there and then shall their senses: hearing, sight and touch or skin bear witness to their deeds of iniquity
They will then look for the how and the why and the wherefore their skins betrayed them! But their skins shall voice all their throats proclaiming: "Allah has recreated us invested, like everything else, with articulate sound and He created you in the beginning from nothingness and back to Him you return
But you could not hide yourselves, even if you wanted to, from the notice of your hearing or your sight or your skins lest they should bear witness against your deeds of iniquity. The fact is, you did not think that Allah knows much of what you do
Such conception as you have formed of Allah, your Creator, was an imagination proceeding from your senses, it has marked but your fall and brought great and irretrievable disaster upon you and you have come to be great losers
And now if they prefer O Muhammad to sit like patience on a monument smiling at grief, nonetheless, they are destined to the abode in Hell. If they invoke Allah's forgiveness, never will heaven respond favourably to their invocation
And We have bound them to evil and Satanic companions who would follow them like their shadows and give them evil counsel and allure them to brighter present and happier destiny by negating resurrection and affirming that black was white. There has come to be what was predicted beforehand that they, like others among the Jinn and mankind of past generations, were born to be great losers
And insolently did the infidels say to each other: "Do not listen to this Quran and, when recited, contrive and contradict the provisions of its edicts loudly as to make it nearly nugatory; perhaps you will gain the upper hand
Wait for the course of events O Muhammad We will make them taste the fatal consequence, and We will requite them for every deed at the gauge of the worst of their iniquities with which they conducted themselves in life
This is the punishment which Allah's enemies shall suffer-Hell- wherein they shall find their eternal abode, in requital of their unforgivable refusal to acknowledge Our Revelations and Authority
There and then shall those who denied Allah say: "Allah, our Creator, would you show us those of the Jinn and mankind who misled us and made us wander from the path of righteousness so that we trample over them, spurn them, treat them contemptuously and reject them with contempt and disdain
Those who have proclaimed what they reverently entertained in their minds, and put their thoughts in words: " Our Ilah is Allah, the Creator.", and they have always trodden the path of righteousness and lifted to Him their inward sight, invite the descent of the angels who come down to impel them to the feeling of security and intimate to them thus: " You are not to fear fate nor to grieve over predestined events, and rejoice your hearts and minds at the blissful tidings of winning the Paradise you were promised
We are your tutelary guardians here and your defenders and intercessors Hereafter, where you will find anything of any kind your emotions are directed to its attainment, and you shall have all that you express the desire for
A reception and entertainment with. Liberality, honour and good will, conferred by Him Who is Ghafurun and Rahimun (Forgiving and merciful)
And who has a better discourse or thoughts expressed in words than he whose discourse induces to the belief in Allah, His Oneness and Uniqueness, and deals with His nature and attributes and he aspires to deeds of wisdom and piety, and proclaims: "I am one of those who conform to Islam and effectuate unqualified obedience to His commands
Nor does a deed crowned with equity and good will compare with a deed tinted with evil and ill - will. Therefore repel what affects you with distaste and aversion by what is morally and spiritually sublime, and there you will find that he who harbours to you enmity and ill - will has come to be as though he were a friend actuated with the feeling of sincerity
Nor can such a disposition that is characterized with sublimity be attained except by those who exercise patience in adversity, forbearance under provocation and constancy in labour and effort. Nor can such a disposition be attained except by those who are so fortunate as to be divinely endowed with such a privilege
And if AL-Shaytan entices you by suggesting diversity or discord secretly to your mind, do not consent nor be actuated, but commit yourself to Allah counter to the evil he instigated; Allah is indeed AL-Sami’ (the Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and AL-Aleem (the Omniscient)
Among His visible signs and His marvels displaying Omnipotence and Authority are the night and the day, the sun and the moon, He created to suberve where wisdom bears command, and not made to rule. Therefore do not bow down in adoration to the sun nor to the moon but bow down in adoration to Allah Who brought them into being and caused them to exist if it is Him you truly worship and you truly adore with appropriate acts and rites
Should they -the infidels- continue to be unjustly extravagant in their accounts of themselves and exercise inordinate self-esteem nonetheless, those with Allah in His heaven's realm praise Him and extol His glorious attributes night and day and never do they grow weary
And among His visible signs and His marvels displaying Omnipotence and Authority is that you see the earth standing so desolate and so bare and when We send down the rain, it is stirred to activity and swells by absorption of moisture and begins the process of vegetal growth. Indeed He who revived it shall bring the dead back to life. He is indeed Qadiron (Omnipotent.) over all things
Those who corrupt Our revelations and distort them from their intended purpose and meaning are not hidden from Us nor is their motive unknown to Us. But then, is he who is cast into Hell fire better or he who comes back in Day of Judgment actuated with the feeling of security? You -infidels- just proceed as you have begun if you will; He is indeed Bassirun (Omnipresent Who sees all that you do)
Indeed, those who declared the Quran, when it was revealed to them, to be untrue and untenable and not what it is stated to be, shall regret their declaration. It is indeed a Book enjoying the majesty and splendour attendant upon a manifestation of Allah
A Book that is not open to falsehood, past, present or ever nor from any aspect. Even if assailed, its inherent power and operative influence are never hurt; it is a disclosure of knowledge, wisdom, and guidance authoritatively revealed by Him, Who is Hakimun (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations), and Hamidun (Worthy of all praise)
Nothing is said to you O Muhammad by your opponents who call you everything they could lay their tongues to that was not said to Messengers sent before you. Indeed Allah, your Creator, has on hand mercy and forgiveness and He has on hand also condign punishment
Had We made it a Quran in a literary form that is ambiguous, un understandable and foreign to their thoughts, they would have said: "If only its revelations and precepts were expounded so that We could apprehend the intended tense!" How is it that We render it in a literary form foreign to people's thoughts when it is addressed to an Arab! Say to them :. " It -the Quran- is the spirit of truth guiding those whose hearts have been touched with the divine hand into all truth. Its inherent heavenly power exerts a remedying effect on their minds to counteract doubt and redress uncertainties; whereas to those who deny it, and their heart's ears are deaf, it exerts a blinding effect on their intellectual and spiritual perception. These are they who seem to be called upon from afar as the earth's distant ends; they are also distant from Allah's blessed abode
We gave Mussa (Moses) the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah) and there it was met with disagreement; it was not in accordance with some of his people's taste and liking; it excited their displeasure and disgust. And had it not been for Allah's Word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment of your opponents O Muhammad in respite, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. They are in perplexity about it -the Quran- with suspicions amongst their thoughts
He who imprints his deeds with wisdom and piety, advantages himself of spiritual privileges, and he who weds himself to evil, invites his own detriment and loss, and never is Allah, your Creator, unjust to His servants
To Him, the Ultimate source and Authority is attributed the knowledge of the point of time of the predetermined and Eventful Hour. And no blossoms come out of their calyces as seeds or fruits, nor does a female - human or animal- conceive a seed in her womb or gives birth to - a child or an animal respectively - but come to His knowledge. And there shall come the Day when He - Allah- calls them up-the infidels - to bring into their minds those whom they incorporated with Him. There and then shall they say: "We truly acknowledge, by way of reparations, our offence which we do regret and none of us can bear witness to a corporate deity
And there, they are forsaken and renounced by those whom they regarded and adored before with appropriate acts and rites, who have failed their expectation. And now such a sure watch laid upon them makes them realize that there is no escape
Nonetheless, man does not weary of invoking Allah's benefaction and benediction, but no sooner he is befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity than he nurses despair and gives up hope
And if We should extend to man Our mercy and make him taste Our benefaction and benediction following what had befallen him of a misfortune, he ventures to say: " This is the meritorious outcome of my thought which ran before my action and I doubt if the alleged Eventful Hour will ever present itself, and if I happen to be resurrected and return back to Allah, my Creator, there and then and at His hands shall I merit the desert of good. In effect there and then We will inform those who denied Allah, and refused to acknowledge His Omnipotence and Authority, of the detailed particulars of their life and We will subject them to a condign punishment which doubles their torment
And when We mercifully bring man in Our grace and show it in Our munificence, he feels impelled to move away and more distant from what Allah inclines him to propound. And when he is befallen with a misfortune or wedded to a calamity- in consequence of his wrongful and unclean hands- he spends his breath invoking Allah's mercy and blessings
Say to them -the infidels- : "What if it -the Quran- is a disclosure of knowledge and wisdom and a guide from Allah, and you refuse to acknowledge it ! who then will have strayed far and wandered widely from the path of righteousness
We will exhibit to them Our marvels in the remote parts of the universe and within themselves until it becomes evident to them that it -the Quran- is the truth personified and the glory of Allah by it is typified. Is it not enough that Allah, your Creator, is Shahidun (a witness) of all things
Yet they continue to be in doubt of the encounter with Allah their Creator. However, never doubt but He is Mohiton (the Omnipresent who is Omniscient of all things in all respects and all in all)
(Ha). M. (Meem)
Ein, S. (Seen), Q. (Qaff) the surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue cannot be emulated
In like manner does Allah inspire to you O Muhammad, even as He inspired to those sent before you His veritable revelations and disclosure of knowledge, precepts and injunctions. Thus Say Allah AL-Aziz (the Almighty), and AL-Hakim (the source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
Allah, Who owns, and has the rightful claim to all that is in the heavens and on earth and supremacy, authority, and power over them are acknowledged as His own. He is above all and beyond all. He is AL-Alim and AL-Azim (the Unique Whose attributes belong to the highest regions of thought and reality)
The heavens almost rend and very nearly tear apart asunder for the profound reverence dutiful to Him in His heaven's realm, and the angels celebrate His Name, and extoll His glorious attributes and invoke His forgiveness for those domiciled on earth. Indeed He -Allah- is it Who is exclusively the AL-Ghaffur and AL-Rahim (Forgiving and the Merciful)
And those who chose to be under the tutelage of others besides Allah, shall He keep them in view. He watches over innocence and folly. You Muhammad are not entrusted to their care nor are you responsible for their ordinary pursuits of life
Thus did We inspire to you O Muhammad a Quran in the Arabic literary form to warn the people of the Mother City -Macca- and the people of all cities around. To caution them against the horror and grisly dread which shall dwell without end on the undoubted and inevitable Day of the Throng when some shall be in the beautiful and blissful region of heaven's realm and others in the blazes
Had Allah willed, He would have made them one conjoint body united in feeling and in thought, but He extends His mercy to whom He will, whereas the wrongful of actions have no tutelary friend or guardian nor can any one afford them help
Or have they chosen to be under the tutelage of others besides Him, but Allah is He under Whose tutelage comes safety and security and He is it Who resurrects the dead and He is Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all thing's
And whatever subject or point you seem resolved to argue or dispute, refer it to Allah, the Ultimate Authority, for decision, recalling Him to the mind and speaking your thought, thus: "He is Allah, my Creator, in Whom I trust and to whom I have recourse for guidance
He is Allah, the Generator of the heavens and the earth, Who provided you with wives and mated you to your kind and provided you with cattle and mated them to their kind so that you procreate and increase in number by natural generation. Nothing material or immaterial is like unto Him; He is AL-Sami’ (the Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and He is AL-Bassir (the vigilant who hears and sees all things)
To Him is attributed the authority and control over the known and the unknown and the mysterious schemes and systems which hold and structure together, in harmonic relations, all that exists in the heavens and on earth. He gives livelihood generously and confers support gratuitously on whom He Will and He also gives with restraint and by measure to whom He will; He is indeed AL- Alim (the Omniscient) of all things
To you people He has enjoined the same system of Faith He enjoined Nuh (Noah); the system of faith which We inspired to you O Muhammad, the same system did We enjoined Ibrahim (Abraham), Mussa (Moses) and Isa (Jesus) to follow
Yet they only became divided into sects and factions, through envy and enmity, each with a belief cherished in their minds after their acquaintance with facts and intellectual perception of the truth. And had it not been for Allah's word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment in respite to a determined point of time, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now. And now your contemporaries, the successors who have inherited the Book AL-Tawrah (the Torah) are in perplexity about it on account of its present Intricate character
Therefore, present them with inducements to entertain the thoughts of Faith and practical Divinity; and cling to the discourse as you have been commanded, and do not yield to their fruitless desires, and say to them: "I have given credence to all the Books Allah has sent down and in all of them do I believe, and I have been commanded to administer right and justice between you. Allah is our Creator and your Creator. We are accountable for our deeds and you are answerable for yours, no proposition does either of us advance to influence the mind of the other nor is there between us a contest of emulation; in one assembly shall Allah bring us together; He is the end and the purpose for which all of us are destined
As to those who contend with opposing arguments against Allah and seem resolved to dispute the truth after it has been accepted by the many who have lifted to Him their inward sight, their argument, in Allah's sight, is as futile in its effects as it is feeble in its principle. and they have come within the measure of Allah's wrath and painful shall be their retributive punishment
Allah is He Who has sent down the Book -The Quran- and the Books sent down before; He sent them down in conformity with truth and in agreement with reality and with the balance of reason and justice, And you never know; the predetermined Hour may well be drawing near and be soon in sight
It -the predetermined Hour- is the wish of those who deny Allah and challenge the truth of it and that it be hastened on, but it is not the object of desire of those whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand, who dread it and stand in awe of it. They know well it is the truth and they make no doubt of its reality. Indeed those who contend with opposing argument against the predetermined Hour, denying that it shall come to pass, are transgressors who are lost in the very depth of the maze of error
Allah is Benevolent and the Benignant Sovereign to His servants; He provides livelihood and He fits out whom He will with what He will and with what is necessary for a certain purpose and He is AL-Qawiyo (the Omnipotent) the Unparalleled, and AL-Aziz (the Almighty)
Who so chooses to go by the Hereafter and has imprinted his deeds with wisdom and piety and reasoned high of Providence to win more advantages thereat, We will reward with what runs higher than what corresponds to his piety, And who so chooses to go by the world We will provide with what is apportioned to him here, but he will be denied any share Hereafter
Or do they have deities who share with Allah His Divine Nature, who ordained for them a particular system of faith and worship other than that Allah has authorized? Had it not been for His word proclaimed beforehand to put punishment in respite to a determined point of time, their Hereafter would have been planted in the now; but the wrongful of actions shall suffer a condign punishment
There and then shall you see the wrongful of actions alarmed at their sinful iniquities in life being exacted with the sudden fear and the apprehension of danger which has beset them on all sides; whereas those who had believed with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds of wisdom and piety, rejoicing beyond a common joy in the beatitude of heaven's realm where they shall find any object of desire or anything of any kind that their emotions are directed to its attainment be in readiness to come to them at will. This is indeed the great bounty and munificence of Providence
This is the happy announcement Allah proclaims to His worshippers whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety. Say to them O Muhammad: "I do not ask you for anything in return except the affection and good disposition toward Allah and His Messenger as well as toward your kin so that you get nearer to Him and win His grace and mercy. And who so crowns a deed with equity Allah shall reward him with what runs higher than what corresponds to his equitable deed. Allah is indeed Gafurun (Forgiving); and Shakurun (He acknowledges what is esteemed a worthy deed)
Or do they say: "He -Muhammad- has related to Allah what he has fabricated and fraudulently imitated!" But if Allah has determined that you Muhammad misrepresent Him, He would have blocked searching's of your heart; and if it be His will He would compose your heart with patience to endure their false and slanderous accusation. But Allah effaces and blots out falsehood and endorses and ratifies the truth by His words which to His acts accord; He is Alimun of all private thoughts and feelings reposted in the bosom
He is it Who accepts repentance of those of His worshippers who in lowliest plight repentant stood and forgives their sins, and He is Cognizant (Omniscient) of all that you do
He grants the prayer and fulfills the wish of those whose hearts reflect, the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety Moreover a provision of His bounty is made for the augmentation of what accords to their request with circumspection. But those who deny Him shall be put to the torment
If Allah were to give livelihood generously and liberally to all His creatures and to confer support gratuitously, they would be apt to run riot on earth and transgress the goal. But He sends down to the extent He prescribes as He will; He is Khabirun (Omniscient), and Bassirun (Whose constant vigilance is extended to all His creatures)
He is it Who sends down the rain lo revive the land and causes it to bear crops after people have been pined with hunger and with drought and have nursed despair;* He extends His mercy and spreads it so that it be felt; He is the Tutelary Provider of tutelary care; it is He to whom are extolled the glorious attributes
Among the visible signs and the marvels, displaying Omnipotence and Authority is His creation of the heavens and the earth** and the beings He scattered over them and the power to gather them and bring them all together when He will
And whatever befalls you of a misfortune or weds you of a calamity is a consequence of your wrongful and unclean hands. Yet He ignores many offences and forgives you a great deal
Nor will you be able to render punishment here ineffectual nor can you frustrate His end or the laws and statutes of His realm; and besides Allah, no one can accord you tutelary care nor can any one afford you help
And among His visible signs and marvels displaying Omnipotence and Authority, are the stately sea going vessels gracefully imposing like majestic mountains
If it be His will, not a breath of wind would cross. the heavens and He would take the wind out of the sails, and motionless shall they remain on its surface, tokens indeed symbolic of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority; tokens giving insight to those who bear well all calamities, and the good events live ever in their thankful hearts
Or if He wills He would overwhelm them with a fierce wind in requital of their iniquities, but many of the offences He ignores and He often forgives you a great deal
A matter of fact to be apprehended by the minds of those who contend with opposing arguments against Our signs, and seem resolved to dispute the truth of Our revelations, that there is no escape nor can they go unpunished
Do not conceit yourselves; all that you have been put in possession of is simply the evanescent and ephemeral enjoyments of life here, whereas all that is in the beatitude of heaven's realm affords eternal and surpassing pleasure Allah. has reserved for those whose hearts reflect and the image of religious and spiritual virtues and in Allah, their Creator, they trust
Who are disposed to avoid major and deadly sins and the willful and deliberate violation of moral principles, and when angered they forgive and do not entertain the thoughts of ill will
Who respond favourably to Allah, their Creator, and have been steered by His guidance. They pay to Him reverence and veneration and engage in worship. They adore Him with appropriate acts and rites and conduct their affairs and ordinary pursuits of life by taking Counsel together to establish justice and integrity. They spend in benevolence and in equity of what We provided them of Our bounty
Who set right and redress a grievance or an abuse, a wrong or a misfortune when treated with injustice, prejudice or harshness
The return of a wrong is a wrong of a like nature, but he who forgives and reconciles himself with his own heart and with Allah, shall Allah credit him with what is due; He detests the wrongful of actions
Yet he who avenges a wrong that has been inflicted upon him, incurs no consequence
But the consequence is indeed incurred on those who wrong people and treat them unfairly with injustice, prejudice or harshness and run wild on earth, going beyond prudent and reasonable limits, such persons shall be put to the torment
But again he who bears the wrongs, and bears with the wrongful and accords him forgiveness, possesses his own soul; this is indeed the mode of considering matters with an attitude of mind reflecting a high spirit and strong will
And he whom Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness, shall find no tutelary guardian besides Him to guide him thereto. And you shall see the wrongful of actions excited with fear and terror when Hell is in their sight. There and then shall they say: "O Allah, do we stand a chance to return back to life and hold Your way and follow it without deviation
And you shall see them exposed thereto -the Fire- and back they recoil with abhorrence from it, mortified with fear and humiliation, glancing with stealthy eyes and catching a glimpse of it. And there shall say those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: "losers indeed are those who lost themselves in vanity, and their crimes lost them mercy and lost them their families on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed the wrongful of actions have brought on themselves eternal suffering
And no tutelary guardians will they have, besides Allah, to afford them the present help or be the fortress they had expected; and he whom Allah does not guide to His path of righteousness shall indeed lose the way thereto
Respond favourably, you people, to Allah, your Creator, before a Day comes when Hereafter shall never be reversed by Allah to Here below, nor shall you find a stronghold, nor can you recourse to the denial of what is true
And If they should turn a deaf ear, nonetheless, We did not send you O Muhammad to watch over their innocence and folly; you are only responsible for relating to them Our message. Yet if We should extend Our mercy to mankind and make them taste Our benediction, they rejoice beyond a common joy, and if a misfortune or a calamity befalls them in consequence of their wrongful or unclean hands, man looks for the how and the why and the wherefore and becomes sour and in bitterness he turns his worst side outwards
With Allah reside the sovereign authority and the supreme controlling power of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He will; He bestows female progeny on whom He will and He bestows male progeny on whom He will
He bestows a combination of both males and females and renders barren whom He will; He is indeed Alimun (Omniscient), and Qadirun (Omnipotent)
No human would qualify to be spoken to directly by Allah without the intervention of a medium, nor is it befitting; but only by inspiration or vision, or from behind a veil or through a spirit who would actuate him with what Allah has ordained and with what He will; He is indeed ?Aliyun (Supreme) above all and beyond all and He is Hakimun (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations)
Thus did We inspire to you O Muhammad the Quran through the spirit Jibril (Gabriel) who actuated you by Our command. You neither knew what the Book the Quran was nor what Faith was like. But We made it -the Quran- a source of light wherewith We impart knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light to guide into all truth whom We will of Our servants. You (Mohammed) do indeed guide to the path of righteousness
The path of Allah Who has the rightful claim to all that is in the heavens and to all that is on earth; supremacy, authority and power over them are acknowledged as His own. Indeed all affairs are Allah's concern; they are referred to Him, the Ultimate Authority, for consideration, decision and execution
(Ha), M. (Meem), the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
And by the Book which is the spirit of truth that guides people into all truth
A Book, We have made in Arabic literary form that you may hopefully comprehend its inimitability and employ the faculty of reason in forming conclusions
And it is a transcript reflecting the grandeur of the archetypal Book in the heaven's realm as held by Us in high esteem and a source of wisdom
Or do you people think that We would disregard you and omit it -the Quran- and the matter would be let drop just because you have been extravagant in your accounts of yourselves and may well neglect this noble discourse
Nor is it a novelty to send you a prophet as a spectacle and a warning, How many did We send to those dating far back into the distant pas
Nonetheless no prophet do We send as a spirit of truth to guide people into all truth but they mock him and give him a lick with the rough side of their tongues and call him everything they can lay their tongues to
They conceit themselves if they contemplate possession of control, power and authority. We did away with nations far mightier, prosecuted with activity and perseverance, whose diligence never wearied and We reduced them into a useless form; and so the fateful events of those of the distant past had served as a warning to those who follow
Yet ironically if you should ask them O Muhammad: who has created the heavens and the earth? They shall say: "They were created by Him, AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Alim (the Omniscient)
Who has made the earth for you a settled habitation* and carpeted it with vegetal growths and furnished it with your daily needs, and He channeled it with paths, tracks, routes and waterways guiding your direction in your course of travel and in your movement
Who sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven enough rain water in due measure and thereby a dead and barren land,* is revived; similarly shall you be resurrected
Who created all pairs of opposite sexes and all creatures and made for you of the ships and the beasts a means of transportation
That you may sit and rest comfortably upon their backs and render solemn acknowledgement of Divine favours when making a land travel or a voyage by sea and exercise the mind in devotional thought and put your thoughts into words, thus: " Glory to Him Who has subjected these animate and inanimate creatures to us; it would have been otherwise impossible to render them submissive and to make them minister to our comfort
And indeed to Allah, our Creator, we shall all ultimately go back
Yet they -the infidels- have incorporated with Him some of His servants as objects of worship and considered them His integral part; indeed man is ungrateful, blasphemous and profane
Or did He adopt from among His creatures the females and committed to you people the males
Yet ironically, the moment that any of them hears the news of the birth of his female child, the sex which he ascribes to Allah AL-Rahman, his countenance at once speaks a different language; his eyes shrivel into darkness in his head and he falls into the darkness of deepest dismay
Is it befitting to ascribe to Allah a creature who is born and raised surrounded by ornaments and articles of personal decoration and fails to defend an argument
And they chose female designations to be the appellations they use of and toward the angels who are servants of Allah, AL-Rahman! Did they witness their Creation! We will commit to writing their irresponsible statement and call them to account
And they allegedly say: "Had Allah, AL-Rahman, so willed we would never have worshipped -these corporate deities-. They are not acquainted with the truth nor do they have information or proof to support their allegation; they simply lic and indeed they lie in their teeth
Or did We reveal to them a Book beforehand authorizing their allegation that they refer to it anal speak like a book
In effect they projected their own cause so as to say: "We have found our fathers bent on a particular system of faith and worship and we walk in their foot steps
But then, We never sent a Messenger before you O Muhammad, to a people but stood those with the riches similitude exact of your people and said: "We have found our fathers bent on a particular system of faith and worship and in their foot steps we walk
And when the Messenger said to them: " Even if I present you with what belongs to the highest region of thought and reality and is more guiding than that you found your fathers bent on and it guides you into all truth"? Yet they said: "But we do not acknowledge your mission nor do we give credence to your message
In consequence We took just vengeance on them; and there you can see what was the end of those who denied the truth
You may refer O Muhammad to an aspect of Ibrahim's (Abraham) narrative when he said to his father and his people: "I am innocent of your ills and of all those you worship
Except Him who brought me into being and caused me to exist; He will indeed guide me into all truth
A dogma he founded and he legated to his posterity and to those who would succeed him, that they may hopefully keep Allah in mind and to Him they would lift their inward sight
But the idolaters ignored Ibrahim's great legacy and so did their successors. Yet I made them both enjoy life until the truth has come to them at the hands of a reputable and esteemed Messenger
And now that they have been presented with the spirit of truth guiding them into all truth, they say: "This is sheer sorcery and we refuse to acknowledge it
And they insolently say: "if only this Quran were revealed to a distinguished man from one of the two cities -Macca and Taif
Do they distribute or apportion the grace of Allah your Creator and His mercy to whom they please! It is We Who have apportioned their livelihood among them here and allotted their sharas authoritatively that they have no choice .We promoted and exalted in rank, honour, estimation, development, power and wealth, some above others and arranged them in grades so that they render obedience and service to one another and minister to the comfort of each other. But to be a recipient of the mercy and efficacious grace of Allah. your Creator, outweighs all that you may accumulate or treasure up in life
Were it not that all people, through envy, would form one conjoint body united in feeling and thought of disbelief in Allah, We would provide the homes of those who deny Allah AL-Rahman with ceilings and roofs of silver as well as stairs of silver by which to ascend
And homes sparkling with silver doors and lounges of silver whereupon they recline and rest with un searching and restful spirit
(And to round this off,) We would provide them with all sorts of adornments all of which are simply ephemeral enjoyments of this life, whereas the beautitude of the Hereafter in heaven's realm has Allah, your Creator, reserved for those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
But he who blinds himself to Allah AL-Rahman's -enlightenments and renders himself insensible of Him and of His authority, We will bind to a devil who will follow him like his shadow and give him evil counsel
Such companionship of evil ones as fitted to destruction will blind those insensible of AL-Rahman of the path of righteousness and make them think they are guided into all truth
Until the Day comes and he is in Our August presence; pained at heart, he will then say to that evil companion: "I wish I had kept my distance and were as distant from you as the two solstices are from each other; how evil you were for a companion
But this Day, they arc told, "no one can afford you help nor can he set you free; you have wronged yourselves and now both of you shall share the condign punishment
But do you think O Muhammad you will be able to make the worthless who counsels deaf open his heart's ears, or the one who lacks intellectual or spiritual perception open his mind's eyes, or that you can guide such persons as have justly been destined to err and stray from the path of righteousness
Therefore, O Muhammad, should We take you away by death before you witness the promised punishment, rest assured that We, will take just vengeance on them
Or if We do not take you away, then We will show you the retributive punishment of which promise was made; indeed We are able to overpower them and reduce them into a useless form
Therefore keep your hold O Muhammad on all that has been inspired to you and cling to the Quran; you are indeed on the path of righteousness
For the Quran is an authoritative counsel to you and a discourse of Practical Divinity to your people and there shall come the Day when all of you will be called to account
And you just test critically the precepts of those whom We had sent before you, to see if We had ordained reverence and veneration to be paid to a being, or a power, or a deity besides Allah AL-Rahman
(To this effect I may example My Omnipotence and Authority by a brief account of Pharaoh and his people in whose hearts reigned vices and follies.) We sent to them Mussa (Moses) and We equipped him with signs serving to demonstrate divine power and authority, and there he said to them: "I am the Messenger of Allah, the Creator of the universe and of all beings
But when he presented them with Our signs and displayed to them acts of a miraculous nature, they laughed them to scorn
And no sign did We present them with but was greater than the sign displayed before, and by consequence We made ruin seize them so that, with hearts travailed, they might hopefully turn to Us and lift their inward sight
United by the fatal consequence, they said to Mussa (Moses): " O you necromancer, skilled in magic, invoke Allah, your Creator, and appeal to Him, in virtue of what He conferred on you of sufficient grace, to deliver us from this burdensome affliction which is exhaustive to the mind and We will be guided into all truth
And when We delivered them from what was burdensome and exhaustive to the mind they simply broke their vow and their actions to their words did not accord
Then, Pharaoh made a public declaration and caused it to be proclaimed through out all his cities: "Am I not", he said, "the sole sovereign of this land, and the dominion of Egypt belongs to me, and these rivers flow beneath my palace! Can you people not see
Am I not", he added "Far better in worldly conditions than this creature who is contemptible and can hardly express himself or put his thoughts into wards
If only a bracelet of gold from heaven's realm has ornamented his arm to betoken authority or he has been companioned with the angels to confer on him dignity in an order of prophet hood
Thus did –Pharaoh- befool his people who soon obeyed him. They were a mischievous people disposed to practice evil
And when they were really enough to provoke Us, they came within the measure of Our wrath and We took vengeance on them and drowned them all
And We made of them, with this vindictive punishment and fateful event, a deterrent which has served as a warning to those who followed
And when the son of Maryam (Mary) - Isa (Jesus) was cited as an example of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority to create whom He will or what He will from nothingness, your people refused to recognize him and laughed him to scorn
Knowing that he is venerated as a deity by Christians and that you Muhammad might have consigned him with their idols, to damnation, they created a connected series of statements intended to annoy you and subvert your position when they said: " Are our God's the better or Him, and if his abode is Hell, we and our God's would love to be there". They are quarrelsome people given to contention
He -Isa (Jesus)- is only a servant of Ours on whom We bestowed the prerogative of Prophethood and made him an example serving to betoken to Bani- Israel (the Children of Israel) Our omnipotence and authority
Had We willed We would have made some of you angels or procreate angels who would live on earth and be your succeeding generations
Coming events cast their shadow before, and so will Isa whose return to earth shall be the sign of impending Judgement and that the Final Hour is indeed imminent. Therefore do not doubt the event you people and follow My Messenger who guides you to My path of righteousness
And let not AL-Shaytan (Satan) tempt you away from My path of righteousness and detract you from piety; he is your avowed enemy
And when Isa presented them -Bani-Israel- with clear evidence of Allah's Omnipotence and Authority, and said to them: " Now I have come to you with all manner of wisdom and soundness of judgment in the choice of means and ends and to clarify to you some of the points upon which your whole dispute turns, therefore, reverence Allah and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and obey me
Indeed Allah is my Creator and your Creator; worship Him, since reverence and veneration paid to Him constitute the path of righteousness
Yet the various sects and factions, Jewish and Christian ignored the knowledge imparted to them and they differed from each other in opinion and moved to disagree among themselves, and so, denunciated shall be those who were wrongful of actions; they shall suffer torment on an Eventful and Grievous Days
What do they expect after their refusal to acknowledge Allah other than the sudden confrontation with the predetermined Hour they shall encounter unexpectedly as it takes them unawares
There and then shall those who were friends become enemies, but not those who revered Allah and entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Him
Addressed by Allah, they -the devotees- will be told: "O My worshippers who had reverenced Me with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, no fear or dread shall fall upon you this Day nor will you come to grief
You, and others such as you, who had honoured Our signs and resigned' themselves to Me and conformed to Islam
Now enter you and your wives into My Paradise, in the heaven's realm of surpassing beauty, supremely blest, where you rejoice beyond a common joy
Therein, shall they be attended upon and served in majestic dishes of gold, and in golden goblets shall they drink the cup of joy; and within there they shall find anything of any kind that the emotions are directed to its attainment and the eyes delight in. And therein they will have passed through Nature to Eternity
And so, this is the region of the heavens featuring surpassing beauty and supreme bliss; it is the desired end of which they have come into possession by Divine grant for their deeds which had been imprinted with wisdom and piety
Therein you have plenteous fruits reflecting plenteous grace from high, fruits which afford them pleasure; they are for them to enjoy
But in Hell, the kingdom of eternal suffering and misery shall the wicked bewail their lot
No relief physical or mental will be expected and in their idea of relief comes the intensity of punishment and the longer they lose hope the more they nurse despair
We never acted unjustly or unfairly to them nor did We not observe the principles of justice and fair dealing. It was they who acted unjustly and unfairly to themselves and were wrongful of actions
There and then shall they call upon Malek -the head keeper of Hell- to mediate suspension of punishments "O Malek", they say, "appeal to Allah, your Creator, to blot us out of existence and extinguish our debt". " Never ", says Malek, "in here you remain and forever you continue to be
O you Meccans: We have presented you with the spirit of truth guiding people into all truth, but most of you do detest the truth and execrate My fact
Or have they decided O Muhammad on a course and set their hearts on denying, the truth anal conspire your death! But it is We who will decide the question by authority and make you reign in their hearts; for great is thc truth and it shall prevail
Or do they think that We do not hear what is not openly avowed and their secret counsel? Indeed, Omnipresence is Our attribute and Omniscience is inherent in Us and Our Messengers are by their sides bearing records and relating in writing in whole
Say to them: "If Allah AL-Rahman had a son, I would precede all others and be the first to pay to him reverence and veneration
Praise be to Him and extolled be His glorious attributes; Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth and of the unique throne of supreme Majesty, Omnipotence, grace and mercy; far be He beyond all measure and above all they attribute to Him
Let them drown themselves O Muhammad in the nonsensical and in vanities and engage in amusement which is the happiness of those who cannot think, until the encounter with the Day they have been promised
And He is it Who is the Allah in the heavens and the Allah on earth and He is AL-Hakim (the Source of wisdom and wise mysterious dispensations) and He is AL-Alim (the Omniscient)
And blessed be He and praise be to Him Who has the glorious attributes and within Whom reside the sovereign Authority and the supreme controlling power of the heavens and the earth and of all that lies between them, Who alone knows the point of time of the predetermined and Eventful Hour, and back to Him shall all of you return
Nor shall those to whom they -the infidels- pay reverence and veneration besides Him have the function of intercession; a privilege confined only to those who had asserted the Uniqueness and Oneness of Allah and bore witness to this truth
And if you should ask them O Muhammad "Who has brought them into being and raised them from dust?" They shall say: "Allah" Yet, ironically, they pay reverence and veneration to others besides Him. How strongly eluded they are that they believe a lie
We have acknowledged your spiritual prompting O Muhammad when you expressed discontent at your people and said: "O Allah, my Creator, these are a people who have counselled deaf and portrayed strong disposition to discord and disbelief
Leave thorn alone O Muhammad and decline to recognize them but address them with the customary formula of salutation " peace " so that if they should thunder against you, they would peace at your bidding and you be out of harm's way, then they shall come to know the fatal consequence of their obsession with follies
(Ha), M. (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
And by the Book which is the spirit of truth that guides people into all truth
The Book which We began revealing at a blessed and a highly esteemed Night, it is incumbent on Us to send a Messenger as a spectacle and a warning and entrust to him an authoritative Book
A night in which every affair proceeding from Him, the Absolute source of wisdom, is disposed of in the manner imparting knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light and displaying Allah's Omnipotence and Authority
An ordinance set forth by Us that We send upon man Our high behests through Messengers who would illuminate the souls by divine truth
An act of mercy vouchsafed by Allah, your Creator, to His Creatures. He is indeed AL-Sami' (with unlimited audition), AL-Alim (the Omniscient)
The Creator of the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them, a fact acknowledged by you people if your hearts have been touched with the divine hand
There is no Ilah but He. He gives life and inspirits the property of animate existence and He occasions death and deprives of animate existence. He is Allah, your Creator, and the Creator of your forefathers
Yet they are objectively uncertain of the plain truth and they give occasion to uncertainty, and they follow that emotion which they think would help them attain the object from which pleasure and satisfaction are expected
You just wait the course of events O Muhammad; there comes a Day when the heavens shall stir smoke-like dust and things end into smoke
There and then shall your people -the Quraishites- smother out of a small danger into a great one by reason whereof ensues a great famine and they will be reduced to the painful extremities of hunger and the hungry flame devours the silent dead
Thence they shall plead with Allah for alleviating their distress: " O Allah, our Creator ", they shall say: "deliver us from what is burdensome and exhausting to the mind and we will submit and believe with hearts reflecting religious and spiritual virtues
But in what way and by what means will they be brought to their senses and keep their promise of submitting to Our Authority with hearts reflecting religious and spiritual virtues once they have been delivered from distress. They have denied Our Messenger who brought them the spirit of truth guiding people into all truth
And they turned a deaf ear and refused to listen and they turned their backs upon him, accusing him at one time of "being taught by others " and at another time "a demoniac, possessed by an evil spirit
But We will, for a while, allow you people to receive Our efficacious grace effecting the end for which it is given. We will help you get over your misfortune, albeit We know that you will return thereafter to the same subject of thought and to your former disposition. You will hug your old irreverent conviction to your hearts and consequently fall from grace
There shall come the Day O Muhammad when We strike the blow that is severe, shocking, disastrous and destructive punishing wrong and avenging crime; the great instance of Our vindictive punishment. Indeed, We will take just vengeance on those wretches who had miss-spent life befooling the minds so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true
And long before them -the Quraishites- We had tested the people of Pharaoh. There came to them a noble Messenger -Mussa (Moses)- inviting them graciously to do what was agreeable and he presented them with inducements
(Inducements) to open their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes and listen to his religious and moral discourse. He said to them: "O you servants of Allah; you had better respond favourably to the spirit of truth guiding people into all truth; I come to you with a message which Allah has entrusted to me and in sincerity and honour do I relate it to you
Nor Should you pride yourselves on disbelief in Allah, your Creator, or set off yourselves against Him with inordinate self-esteem. I come to present you with delegated authority to influence your conduct and your actions
And here do I commit myself to Allah, my Creator and your Creator, counter to your hostile attitude of mind which may induce you to stone me to death
And it you do not pin your faith upon me and you think I am open to suspicion then leave me alone and keep me out of harm's way
There and then did Mussa make devout and humble supplications to Allah his Creator, praying for His aid, setting forth in words by reference to their wicked characteristics
March My servants to the sea by night", he was told; "you will be followed. for their vengeance shall follow you wherever you are
And after you have stricken the sea with your staff and made a footpath for your people across, calm yourself and let the sea return to its settled calm. They are a multitude of men destined to drown
And so, how plentiful was what they left behind; they were in a condition of abundance: gardens and springs
And all kinds of vegetal growth and products of the soil and mansions and stately homes
And luxuriation in power and luxuriation in abundance of the necessities and comforts of life wherewith they rejoiced beyond a common joy
Thus did We put another people of a different race and creed in possession and made them the heirs, whereas their name was the only inheritance they left
And neither the heaven nor the earth shed tears over them; they were not going to weep at what they were glad for; nor was the wicked's just punishment meant to be put in respite
There and then did We deliver Bani-Israel (the Children of Israel) from the suffering and the painful humiliation
Inflicted by Pharaoh who beheld his unfortunate people from an exalted throne and was extravagant in his account of himself and was fond of his own way which he saw but the one way to erect tyrannies in all his cities
Such prerogative as We confined to Bani-Israel was based on Our knowledge of who best deserved, among all people of the time, to be the recipient of Our mercy and blessings
And We conferred on them what was to their need: convenience and comfort and We bestowed on them -through Mussa acts of miraculous nature serving to demonstrate divine power and authority. All together, were a sure test of their actions and reactions which would echo their true beliefs and the prevalent inclination among them
Yet these -Quraishites- who deny Resurrection, insolently say
We only die once when we come to our life's end and never will we be resurrected
And they add, if you Muhammad together with those who have fallen into line truly assert an Eternal Providence and justify the truth of Resurrections then bring back our forefathers
Are they -the Meccan infidels- the better in wordly conditions than the people of Tobba* and their predecessors? But We did away with them, and reduced them into a useless form; they were evil personified
Nor did We create the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them in amusement and diversion
In effect We have not created both of them but in conformity with truth and in agreement with reality with soundness of judgment in the choice of means and ends; but, in darkness most of them walk on and they know not, nor do they even understand
Indeed the Day of segregation of the rightful from the wrongful who indulged in vanity is the calculated point of time and the moment of impact eventful to them all
This is the Eventful Day when no master shall avail his subordinates nor can a subordinate avail his master but like master, like man, nor can anyone afford them help
Except those to whom Allah will extend His mercy; He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty), and AL-Rahim (the Merciful)
There and then shall the ugly, the bitter and disagreeable tree of Zaqqum or (Zaqqoom)
Be the edible food of the sinner
Food which like molten metals. will keep boiling inside the bellies
And like water brought to the bolting point
The angels posted as sentinels keeping guard of the Fire are commanded, thus: "Seize him and detain him -the sinner- and take him to the depths of Hell
And pour on his head torrents of painfully tormenting boiling water
Now taste and see," he is told, "how just is the retribution; you had tasted the pleasure of your saw of might and you preferred might to right just as you had enjoyed and abused birthright
This is the just retribution you had always doubted
But those who had entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, shall be welcomed to where they are privileged, with safe-conduct and security
Amid beautiful gardens and dazzling springs
Dressed up in silk gowns and ornamented brocade and seated in opposite directions enjoying the glory of heaven
Thus shall it be, and thus shall We join them in wedlock to beauty with attractive dark eyes whose splendour could not have been sustained in life
Whatever fruit they ask for or they portray in their minds shall be given with surety; they have been given the security
They shall suffer no death other than the first death they had encountered at their life's end, and now they have been saved the torment of the Fire
An efficacious grace of Allah your Creator, effecting the supreme triumph for which it is given
We have revealed it -the Quran - in your tongue O Muhammad; so that it takes effect and be of operative influence on your people that they may comprehend and lift to Allah their inward sight
Events cast their shadow before, therefore await the course of events. O Muhammad you will come to know what fate awaits them and likewise they are also waiting
(Ha), M. (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue, cannot be emulated
It -the Quran- is a Book that is emphatically revealed by Allah in complete glory, featuring Him as the guide, and who could be a better guide than Allah, AL-Aziz (the almighty), AL-Hakim (the Wise)
The heavens and the earth are teeming indeed with signs and symbols expressive of acts of miraculous nature serving to demonstrate divine Singleness, Uniqueness, Omnipotence and Authority for those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues
And in the special creation* of you people , and in the propagation of the animal kingdom all around , are signs and symbols serving to demonstrate divine omnipotence and authority for people who ponder
And the variation in duration besides the constant alternation and succession symbolic of the night and the day*, and the rain Allah sends down from the floor of the vault of heaven wherewith He revives the earth after it has suffered death,** and the air in motion in the various directions and of varying degrees of force*** perceptible to the senses and the variation in weight and pressure are indeed signs emblematic of His Omnipotence and Authority, for people who reflect
So, these are cosmic signs characteristic of the vast scale of the universe and its changes which We relate to you O Muhammad in truth by inspiration actuated by the Spirit Jibril (Gabriel). If they -the infidels- refuse to acknowledge the truth as is featured in these signs; what then will convince them if this Quran and these signs do not
Denunciated shall be every sinful liar who intentionally asserts what is false and relates it to Allah, and clothes himself with the ugly vesture of wickedness
A vesture of wickedness that makes him counsel deaf to Allah's revelations when they are recited, declaring to him what is in conformity with truth and in agreement with reality. He intentionally closes his heart's ears and exercises inordinate self-esteem as though he lacked his sense of hearing. Tell him O Muhammad to expect a condign punishment
And when he -this wicked- commits to memory any of our revelations or hears of any of our signs demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority, he turns them into ridicule, and his vanity blows malicious mockery. Such persons are incensed with multiple wrongs; they shall suffer multiple humiliations and a mortifying punishment
Hell awaits them and asserts them as her own and shall beset them on all sides. There and then nothing they earned, accomplished or gained here will be of advantage to them nor will those whom they adopted besides Allah and held in reverence and veneration avail them benefit or afford them help, and they shall suffer grievously
This Quran features the spirit of truth guiding into all truth; and those who refuse to acknowledge its revelations and deny Allah's signs demonstrating Omnipotence and Authority shall suffer excruciating pain and be put to torture
Allah is He who reduced the sea* to a state of subjection under your dominion and authority so that ships may float thereon for transportation by His invisible acting force that produces their motion, that is besides being of service in effecting your objects sought after of His bounty so that your bosoms would hopefully surge up and answer thanks
And He reduced for you all that the heavens and the earth contain to a state of subservience: heavenly bodies, earth, water, air, fire, deserts. All, like yourselves and your belongings, are not really your own, but His. Here, there and everywhere are signs with prodigies emblematic of Omnipotence and Authority sensed by those who consider matters and ponder their cause
Say O Muhammad to those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues to forgive and give up resentment against those who do not expect with desire nor desire with expectation the days when Allah requites like for like and repays a people with what is commensurate with their deeds
He who does what effects a good purpose and what is consonant with equity, and his deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety will have benefited his own soul, and he who is wrongful of actions and instills evil in his works will have lost his own soul; then ultimately to Allah, your Creator, shall all of you be brought back
Allah asserts: " We gave Bani-Israel (the Children of Israel) the Book and authority and soundness of judgment in the choice of means and ends and bestowed on them the Divine prerogative of Prophethood, We provided them with victuals of the various good and wholesome kinds of provisions, and they wore Our favour to the end that We preferred them above all peoples*. (At the time when idolatry and aetheism prevailed)
And We presented them with clear divine evidence serving as the ground for belief, yet they did not move to disagree among themselves and be at variance until they had received informative knowledge and intellectual acquaintance with the truth. They, then, vented what their breasts* have forged of enmity, ill- will and envy occasioned by their contemplation of your superior advantages. But Allah shall judge between them on the Day of Resurrection on the strained points upon which the whole unreasoning turns
Then We determined for you O Muhammad the statute, the perfect exemplar of excellence, the statute which We ordained for the Messengers before you. So, act upon it and in accordance with it and do not gratify those who knowingly deviate from the path of righteousness, nor act upon their desires
They are of no advantage to you nor can they avail you protection from Allah's punishment. In fact the perverse who are wrongful of actions joined in mutual intimacy, whereas Allah is the friend and protector of those who are eminent in piety; they enjoy His special favour
This Quran is a spectacle of truth guiding people into all truth and inducing those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues to lift to Him their inward sight and entertain expectation of His mercy which is imbued in this Book
Or do those whose deeds are haunted with evil, conceive in their minds that We assess them in life and death in the same value We ascribe to those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety? How absurd and irrational is their judgment
And in accordance with reason and truth did Allah create the heavens and the earth, and the truth is unfolded to their own view demonstrates omnipotence and authority. He purposed to requite every soul with what is commensurate with its qualities and its actions, and they shall not be wronged
Have you seen O Muhammad the one who is possessed by the idea directing him emotionally to take his personal vanity as his deity and look up to it in adoration, knowing that he is wrongful of action! and on that ground did Allah lead him into error and deny him intellectual hearing and close his heart's ears and veil his mind's eyes and dispose him to denseness of intellect! So conditioned, who then, besides Allah, can guide him to the path of righteousness? Will you people not ponder
And those who deny future life think aloud the thoughts passing through their minds: "There is only this present life " they say, " we die and as the grass upon the earth shall our posterity be ", then they shall also die and their posterity live, until time does away with life and reduces this world into a useless form and all time shall appear but short time, but indeed as no time". So they think, and with their ignorance of the facts, their action of evidence fails to convince their minds, and their supposition is formed on grounds admittedly insufficient
And when Our clear and evident revelations are recited to them indicating Our Omnipotence to effect Resurrection, the only reason they bring in support of their notion existing only in thought is the same argument they always advance, thus: "Bring Our fathers back to life, if indeed what you claim be true
Say to them O Muhammad: "Allah has brought you to this world and caused you to exist from nothingness and He occasions your death when you end your days, then brings you together on the Day of Resurrection, the Day giving no occasion to doubt or uncertainty". But most people do not realize this fact nor do they bring vividly before their minds Allah's Omnipotence to effect what He will
And to Him belong the sovereignty and the absolute controlling power of the heavens and the earth, and when the predetermined final Hour arrives at the defined time, there and then, shall those who assert falsehood lose their way and incur the loss of every attribute they formerly possessed
And you shall see every nation falling on their knees with horror driven through them compounded of pain and fear. Each nation in its corporate character is being called to account according to their good or bad books, and be told: "Today you are requited with what is commensurate with your deeds
This is Our Book of Records in which entry of your deeds has been made in truth. We have kept a register in which Our angels committed to writing every word, deed and event in a precise manner affording indisputable evidence of all matters in question
So that those who believed with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety, shall Allah, their Creator, welcome into the realm of His mercy; a state of supreme triumph
But as to those who denied Allah, they will be told: "Have Our revelations not been recited to you but you exercised inordinate self-esteem, and you obstinately determined to criminate yourselves by allusion to falsehood; an allurement by which you fell and were a people of sin
And when it was related to you by Our Messenger that the promise of Allah is the absolute truth and that the predetermined final Hour is an undoubted and inevitable event, you always stated explicitly": “We do not profess to know what the predetermined final Hour is, nor do we recognize it; in effect our opinion of it is only a supposition formed on grounds admittedly insufficient”
There and then shall their deeds of iniquity, and their actions of an evil savour present themselves to them and be on view, and now on all sides shall they be beset by the same material and immaterial things they turned into ridicule
And they are told: "Now is the Day we forget you and you will be left to twist and turn in the scorching flames of Hell, in vindication of the right you had willfully forgotten; You neglected the noble discourse, addressed to you; you disregarded Allah and His Omnipotence to effect what He will, and you failed to advance what would serve as a future security on this momentous Day, therefore it serves you right to be in Hell which punishes wrong and avenges crime, and no one now can afford you help
A penalty imposed on you people in the train of blowing malicious mockery at Allah's revelations and signs which demonstrated Omnipotence and Authority, and you were also deceived by the sensuous enjoyment you regarded as the chief object of life". Therefore, now such persons will not be delivered out of it nor will they be reproached
Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes, the Creator of the heavens and the earth and of this world and the world to come and of the state of past, present and future existence
It Him befits the unique attribute of " Proper Pride " as well as the glory, majesty and splendour attendant upon the manifestation of His Supreme Being in the heavens and on earth And He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
(Ha), M. (Meem) the Surah opens with these introductory letters from the Arabic Alphabet to draw attention to the miracle of the Quran which though written in the people's tongue , Cannot be emulated
(With reference to the Quran): It is a Book emphatically revealed by Allah in complete glory, featuring Him as the guide, and who could be a better guide than Allah AL-Aziz (Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
Who declares in His own words, thus: "We have not created the heavens and the earth and all that lies between them but in accordance with reason and truth and for a determinate period of time. " Yet those who deny Allah turn a deaf car to the advice inducing them to alter their evil course when warned of its danger but they disregard the warning and burry it in oblivion
Say to them O Muhammad: "Do you see those you people invoke besides Allah; if you consider them deities or creatures of diligence and capacity, then show me what in the world you live on did they form out of nothingness and brought into being and caused it to exist". Or do they claim participation in the process of the creation of the heavens, or do they assert that: part of it is their own! Say to them: " Bring me a Book revealed before this Book-the Quran- wherein a deity has ordained idolism and brought it to book ! or bring me traces of knowledge and facts featured in a book if you truly speak like a book
And who can err and stray from the path of righteousness more than he who invokes besides Allah a creature, spiritual, animate or inanimate who shall never respond to him till the Day of Judgement, nor are such creatures aware of their invocation
and when mankind are thronged before Allah for judgment, they shall see those whom they invoked here are at enmity with them Hereafter, they shall contemptuously refuse to acknowledge their supplication
Yet when Our evident and plain revelations are related to them and Our signs are clearly indicated and pointed out, then those who deny Allah label the truth presented to them as falsehood and say: "This is only sorcery assumed by him - the Messenger
Or do they say: "He -Muhammad- has forged it " Say to them: " if I have forged it; what good does it do me, and if I did as you unjustly claim, then who on earth can defend me from Allah and vindicate my cause ? " Allah knows best your minds which strive laboriously for some evil end; but enough is Allah to be a witness of my actions and of your actions and He is AL-Gafur and AL-Rahim (the Forgiving and the Merciful)
Say to them: "I am not a novelty of Apostleship hither to unknown to you nor do I know what is to be or will be, nor what is in store for me or for you . I only submit to what is inspired to me by Allah and do what I am commanded to do, and I am only a spectacle and a warning
Say to them " What if this Book -the Quran- is a Divine disclosure of knowledge by Allah to man, and you refuse to acknowledge it when all the preceding Books, foretold things to come crowned by the Quran as has been acknowledged by one or more of Bani-Israel (Children of Israel) who attested that it conforms, like the Book of Mussa (Moses), with truth and agrees with reality?" Yet you deny it and you turn your heads in contempt and you object to it with inordinate self-esteem. But never will Allah impress piety on the hearts of the perverse who are wrongful of actions
And those who deny Allah speak of those who sincerely believed in Him, and say: "If it -the Quran- were good and has a quality in a sufficient degree, we would have been the first to take it as a matter of choice;" and so, since they respond to the Quran with careless disinterested spirit and disfavour, they will label it: "fables of old
And before the Quran, Allah sent down the Book of Mussa steering people by His guidance and His mercy to the path of safety and righteousness, There came down the book-the Quran-, in the Arabic tongue, asserting the truth of the Book of Mussa and warning the perverse who are wrongful of actions, thus serving as blissful tidings to those whose deeds are printed with wisdom and piety
those who have spiritual perception of Allah and their tongues always vent this feeling, viz: " Allah is He to Whom we commend ourselves in the act of worship and in reverential awe, in judgment and in our way of life and in all that we do or say, " and under no circumstances will they alter the attitude of their minds and their habitual mode of settled behaviour; these shall have no ground for alarm nor will fear or dread fall upon them nor will they have a cause of grief Hereafter
These are the inmates of Paradise wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity in requital of their meritorious actions and their wise and pious deeds
We commended to man his parents, to commit them to his kind care and display to them a friendly and a kind disposition. With travail did his mother bear him and with travail did she bring him forth, and between bearing him, weaning and rearing him she spends thirty months of bodily and mental toil. Then when he has grown to maturity and attained the age of forty he invokes Allah, thus: " O Allah, my Creator " he prays, " create in me a clean heart and actuate me with the feeling of gratitude and gratefulness to You for the efficacious grace you conferred on me and on my parents: that I do deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety, that You create in my progeny clean hearts impressed with religious and spiritual virtues, Now I do repent of the wrong doings I might have done, and I join those who commit their causes to You
These are they whose best deeds will Allah count to them for righteousness, and ignore their wrong doings and quit them all His debt, and destine them to make abode in the beatitude of heaven: a Divine assurance of future blessing they have been promised
But he who contemptuously says to his parents: " Fie on you " " How disgusting what both of you tell me!" "do you afford me ground of expectation of Resurrection when all generations who had departed life long ago never came out of their graves ? " They both-the parents-exercise pity and appeal to Allah for help and they rebuke him -the son- for his disposition and for want of Faith, and they utter denunciation against him and say to him: " You had better commit yourself to Allah Whose promise is true. " But he says to them: " This is nothing but fables of old
Such persons among preceding generations of the Jinn and mankind were born to it; it was their destiny to suffer loss and such destiny has been fulfilled
There are grades for all; grades of appreciation and grades of depreciation; grades commensurate with the deeds, for Allah is vigilant; He pays the equivalent and no one will be wronged
One day those who denied Allah shall be exposed to Hell fire and be told: " You abused the gifts Allah has endowed you in life: faculty, Power, quality, ability, talent - and countless other good things, and you exhausted them all in sensuous enjoyment which was your chief object of life, and you neglected to spare what will insure your future security Hereafter. Therefore, this Day you will be subjected to the affliction of humiliation in requital of turning your heads in contempt, your inordinate self-esteem and of your evil practice
Relate O Muhammad to your people the narrative of Hud, a brother of 'Ad -the 'Adites-, a spectacle and a warning, He cautioned his people, who inhabited the valley of the sandy hills -Al Ahqaf-, against the danger of denying Allah, especially when other Messengers have preceded and others succeeded him and the peoples' fate served as a deterrent. He said to them: " I fear for you an immense punishment on a great Day
His people -the 'Adites- said to him: " Have you come to us to induce us to forsake our gods; " " bring about what you have promised us if indeed you are declaring the truth
He -Hud- said: "The acquaintance with this fact lies entirely-in the hands of Allah and in His power; I only relate to you the message entrusted to me by Allah, but I do see that you are so ignorant that you do not know your duties to Allah
And when they saw a cloud drift coming their way they expressed glad feeling because their valley had suffered drought and they said: " This is a cloud whose rain shall bring a rainbow of hope, joy and prosperity. But that was a joy in which they could not rejoice. This, " said Hud, " is what you have challenged to be hastened on; " " it is but a storm charged with a condign punishment bearing impetuously upon you
reducing to useless form and ruins anything it touched by Allah's command that they were laid low in horrible destruction, and nothing could be seen but the remains of their wrecked and empty homes; thus do We require a people given to crime
We had endowed them with power and ability, with diligence and capacities of action, with wealth and knowledge, with mental receiving Dower and talent, and with many qualities which total up to a much higher degree then those that are summed up in you' people. We conferred on them the power of hearing and seeing, faculties divine, and We conferred on them the seat of feeling, understanding and thought, and the seat of consciousness, intellect and volitions, but they' took a bad advantage of thesc divine qualities and misused them, Consequently neither their power of hearing nor that of seeing were of any advantage to them nor did they derive benefit of their intellect or of their volitions; They simply ignored Allah's revelations and signs, and by consequence they were beset on all sides by the same material and immaterial things they mocked at, owing to their inordinate self-esteem
And before them in time, did We do away with towns all around you people. We displayed to them many signs and revealed many revelations all demonstrating divine power and authority and indicating some coming event, so that they stand repentant in lowliest plight and return their thoughts to Allah, but they did not
Did those whom they worshipped in accession to Allah afford them aid or! assistance Never. Contrarily, they could not find them, and it serves them right; they befooled the minds and the judgment of the people so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true
We resolved to direct some of the Jinn toward the place where you Muhammad were leading your followers in the act of worship, reciting the Quran. When they were within hearing; a command to be quiet was uttcred by some and they listened to the end of the recital. They hastened back to their people advising them to alter their course of actions when warned of its danger
Our people ", they said, "We have just heard a recital of Allah's revelations from a Book revealed in succession to the Book sent down to Mussa. It is in harmony with, and declaring the truth of, all Divine Books sent down before it; it is a spirit of truth guiding into all truth and to the path of safety and righteousness
Our people", they added, "open your hearts' ears and respond favourably to the man entrusted by Allah to guide you into all truth, and believe in him and give credence to all that he says; then Allah will forgive your sins and save you from condign punishment
And he," they said, "who turns a deaf ear to the man entrusted by Allah to guide people into all truth, must realize that he will not and simply cannot frustrate the laws and statutes of heaven's realm on earth nor can he be under the tutelage of any one besides Allah." Such persons are they who hold fast to false beliefs
Can they not see with their minds' eyes that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and did not grow weary or worn out with fatigue, is able to resurrect the dead and restore them to life ?He is Qadirun (Omnipotent) to effect all things
One day will those who denied Allah be exposed to Hell fire and be asked: "Is this not consistent with the truth? By Allah, our Creator ", they will say "indeed it is" Therefore, they are told, "now taste with all your senses the merciless but just retribution for denying Allah and for your insolent disregard of His warning
Therefore, in patience O Muhammad possess you your soul as did the resolute among the Messengers; and do not dwell on their punishment to be hastened on; for, on the day they face resolutely what they have been promised, they will realize that life here was a scene of ephemeral glory, imperceptibly minute as though it had lasted for no more than an hour of the time of daylight. This is a divinely inspired message entrusted to a Messenger; a message that warns of a condign punishment, and who shall suffer it but a people given to wickedness and crime
Those who denied Allah and stood in the way to prevent Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth, has He imprinted their deeds with irreverence, profanity and damnation
But those who believed in Allah, with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety, believed in all that has been revealed to the Prophet Muhammad from Allah, in conformity with truth, has Allah erased and deleted their sins and has given them peace of mind and peace of conscience
Such dispositions: were indeed befitting for the reason that those who denied Allah went in pursuit of the worthless and in vain they wasted their days, while those who believed in Allah with hearts impressed with the image of virtues sought the truth disclosed by Him. Thus Does Allah discourse to people their parables
So conditioned, when you people encounter those deniers of Allah, in combat, strike their necks to inflict death, and subdue the living at their peril, keep them in confinement and restrict their movements until hostilities have ceased and your enemies have laid down their arms. There and then you either set the captives free for nothing at all in return or for a ransom or for the freedom of Muslim captives. Had Allah willed, He would have punished them in His own manner. But He means to rear you and educate you so that your actions evince both wisdom and integrity, Allah then will establish your genuineness and quality as is asserted or claimed when reason has to deal with force and when you deal with each other in peace and in wars and to prove that the purpose of Allah is objectively the heart of your purpose. And remember that those of you who resisted blood, to acquire the glorious privilege of a martyr never will Allah imprint their works with irreverence profanity or damnation
But He shall steer them by His guidance, and give them peace of mind and peace of conscience
And He will welcome them into gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty, the paradise which He has portrayed to them already, and of which He has given them a detailed and a graphic account
O you who believe with hearts impressed with religious and spiritual virtues: if you intend to direct your minds and thoughts to striving in the cause of Allah and to make His purpose the heart of your purpose, He will help you defend your final cause and help you take a firm position and set your feet firm
But those who denied Allah, He will afflict with the miseries of fallen greatness and imprint their works with irreverence, profanity and damnation
A disposition rightfully earned for their averted state of mind and mental attitude of persistently opposing all that Allah has revealed in conformity with truth and in agreement with reality; and so He doomed their hopes to disappointment and their deeds to worthlessness
Have they not journeyed through the land and looked with their mind's eyes to see the fatal consequence of those who came before them in time how Allah laid them low in horrible destruction
That is because those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues are under the tutelage of Allah, whereas those who deny Him are under the tutelage of nobody
Indeed Allah shall welcome those whose hearts. Reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues into gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, while those who deny Him experience life delight and eat in the way cattle eat; and in Hell shall they make abode
How many townships did We destroy; townships which enjoyed great controlling power that made their authority felt; townships which were powerful to a greater extent than your town O Muhammad which drove you out and ousted you of your home. Yet no one was there to fight for their safety or offer them help
Can he who has acknowledged the truth captivating his heart's ears and his mind's eyes compare with him whose deeds of evil and iniquity allured his mind's eyes and induced him to hug his irreverent conviction to his heart? Or can he compare with such persons who have entertained sensuous notions and in vain have wasted their days
And does it compare: the garden of bliss and surpassing beauty promised to those who believe with breasts filled with reverential awe wherein rivers flow with untainted pure fresh water, and rivers flowing with tasteful, unchanging, immutable milk, rivers flowing with wine making glad the hearts of those who drink it, and rivers flowing with strained clear honey, a garden in which grow all kinds of fruits and the grace of Allah's mercy and forgiveness. Does this blissful state compare with the state wherein one suffers the permanent abode in Hell where in the inmates are forced to drink boiling water melting their bowels
Among your listeners O Muhammad are those who are hypocrites. They apparently incline their ears to you while their hearts' ears are closed, and when they leave at the end of your discourse of instructions and exhortation, they, in a cunning manner, ask your faithful associates who have intellectual acquaintance with facts: "What was it that he -Muhammad- has just said?" These are they whose hearts has Allah impressed with dullness of comprehension and they followed their own lustful course and a religion of a sensuous character
But those whose minds' eyes have led them to the path of safety and righteousness, Allah has justified faith as a conviction operative on their character and will and imprinted their deeds with wisdom and piety
Do they (The infidel Meccans together with the hypocrites) intend to remain in their state of disbelief until they suddenly face the foreordained Hour? But its shadows have been cast and its preceding signs have come into peoples' knowledge; and so where can they turn and what can profit them when it comes upon them
Therefore, you must know O Muhammad and realize with great prudence that there is no deity but Allah. Invoke His forgiveness on your behalf for anything you might have done wrongly and on behalf of the believers among the men and the women whose hearts reflect that image of religious and spiritual virtues. Allah is well acquainted with all your activities during daylight and with all your doings when you rest in your homes
And those who have conformed to Islam say: " If only a Surah (Chapter) be revealed ordaining war against those who deny Allah (or Jihad in His cause)!" yet when a Surah is revealed wherein Allah does not play with metaphor but He comes to the point, then you see those whose hearts melt away in disease and lassitude look toward you with a countenance standing similitude exact of someone who has fallen into a fainting fit in conflict with the encounter with death and it serves them right
Willing obedience coupled with words expressing desire for action should have been their response and when Allah's command comes about, then if their actions to their words accord, it would be more advantageous to them
And if you people fail to obey Allah's command, then do you have in mind, as a fixed purpose, to make mischief and create discord on earth and break the ties of a common blood and of uterine consanguinity
such persons are those whom Allah has afflicted with such evils as indicate a malignant fate and has deafened their hearts' ears and blinded their minds' eyes
Do they not ponder and meditate upon the Quran or do they keep locks upon their hearts
Those apostates who have renounced Faith in favour of disbelief after the spirit of truth has guided them into all truth, were victims of Al-Shytan (Satan) who took advantage of them, instigated them and suggested to their minds heavenly shows thereby staking their very lives on very dark hopes
AL-Shytan took advantage of them when they consented to help those who held all that Allah has revealed in a very strong dislike and cherished hatred to His revealed religion; they said to them: " we will obey you in some respects, " (namely: to carry on underhand plotting and to plan some actions to attain the desired end, and to employ secret influence for the accomplishment of set designs), but Allah knew what their hearts forged that their tongues must vent
How will they react when the angels of death besiege them all about to disembody their souls and descend violently upon them striking their faces and their backs
So be it, because they practiced the vices incidental to paganism and hypocrisy: disobedience, intrigues and vices which Allah detests and has forbidden. They allied themselves to the enemies of Allah and His Messenger and bore malice to every propitious action that pleases Allah and so He Imprinted their deeds with irreverence, profanity and damnation
Or do these people, whose hearts reflect the morbidity inherent in their innermost being, think that Allah will not expose their malicious feelings
Had We willed We would have written a letter of discredit upon their faces, and you Muhammad would have recognized them by the emblem imprinted on their sinister faces. But in any case, you will recognize them when they express their thoughts in words in an air of contempt and they adjust them to their malicious attitude. Allah Knows all that they do
In fact, We will most certainly try you people to distinguish you into those who consider Allah's purpose the heart of their purpose and strive patiently in His cause, and those who are not moved to action; and to ascertain your spirit and your worth when you engage in the practical test of actual experience
Those who denied Allah and stood in the way to prevent Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth, and forsook the Messenger after the truth was made evident to them by heaven and by men, shall not harm Allah in the least, but He will imprint their deeds with irreverence, profanity and damnation
O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: obey Allah and obey the Messenger and do not render your deeds void and devoid of real value by renouncing Faith
Indeed, those who have renounced Faith and prevented Allah's spirit of truth from guiding people into all truth and they died captivated in disbelief, never will Allah forgive them nor quit them His debt
Therefore do not weaken in power or in strength of purpose nor be tempted to invite your enemy to peace when you are in control of the situation and you have the upper hand. Remember that Allah stands by you to protect you and defend you, and He will not reduce or annul the value of your efforts
And keep in mind that life here is but an illusive and rapid change of feeling, fancy and thought, and an amusement which brings happiness to those who cannot think. But if your hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and you entertain the profound reverend dutiful to Allah, He will pay you all you merit and He will not ask you to spend your wealth in His cause except to give zakat (alms); for zakat is but the vehicle of prayer and if he -the needy- be hungry, it is zakat that feeds him
For, if He - Allah - were to ask you to spend all your wealth in His cause and bear heavily on you, you would be unwilling to give or spend anything, and then He will have exposed your unwillingness and your secret grudge against spending
There, at that point, you people are invited to spend, all that you can afford in the cause of Allah. Some of you will show unwillingness, and he who is parsimonious and unwilling, will only deny himself the future security depending on how much he had advanced in life to be credited to his own account in heaven's realm. And remember that Allah is AL-Ghaniy (Independent and Absolute); He is the riches of the heavens and the earth and if you are as dependent on Him as indeed you are, then you are poor enough and if you people turn a deaf ear, He will replace you by other people who will not be the like
We have opened for you O Muhammad the way of wisdom, and We have circumstanced the matters of fact in Our own manner to give you access to every virtue which makes fortune and victory sit on your Helm
As a logical inference, Allah forgives you all your faults of the past and also those to come, and complements His bounty and munificence on you and guides you to the path of safety and righteousness
And Allah helps you gain the mastery and be exaltedly triumphant
It was He Who inspired peace and tranquility to the hearts of the believers whose breasts are filled with reverential awe, so that their hearts be impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and their deeds with wisdom and piety. And to Allah belong the forces, specific and generic of the heavens and the earth, and Allah has always been Alimun (Omniscient), and Hakimun (Wise)
So that, He affords entrance to those Whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues, among the men and the women, in gardens of surpassing beauty, beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity and He erases and deletes their sins. It pleases Allah to confer such a great triumph
And like that, He afflicts the hypocrites, men and women, and those, among them, who incorporate with Him other deities and think evil of Allah and view Him with contempt; On them shall rebound and recoil the evil thoughts they imputed to Him; they provoked His anger against them and He has afflicted them with such evil as indicates malignant fate. He has prepared for them the abode in Hell, and evil indeed is the destination
For again, to Allah belong the forces, specific and generic, of the heavens and the earth; and He has always been Azizun (Almighty) and Hakimun (Wise)
We have sent you O Muhammad to be a witness who shall testify, in Day of Judgment, of the response of the people to the Divine message and We sent you to deliver the joyful news to those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and to be a spectacle and warning
So that you people believe in Allah and His Messenger with hearts impressed with the image of virtue, and to make His purpose the heart of your purpose and to entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him and to praise Him and extoll His glorious attributes at the beginning and at the end of the day
Those who take the vow to you Muhammad to serve Allah with breasts filled with reverential awe and deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety, is in effect it is to Allah that they render their vows; the hand of Allah be at the top of their hands. And he who breaks his oath, he but breaks it to his own great detriment, and he who fulfills the promise he made to Allah, will be requited greatly
Mark well. O Muhammad what the stay-at-home desert Arabs will say to you: " We were unable to be part of your expedition and join battle (if there is any) on account of our constant attention to our commercial transactions and to our families, and we seek your help in invoking Allah': forgiveness on our behalf". They speak with their tongues in their cheeks and what they utter and what their hearts forge do not together accord. Say) to them: " who is he who has power to restrain Allah from a contemplated action and prevent the coming-on of a calamity or of prosperity? But indeed Allah has been well acquainted with what you were doing
In effect you people thought that the Messenger together with the faithful believers should be caught in the jaws of death and never would they return back safe to their people. This mental anticipation allured your hearts by hopes of relief, and you hugged this evil thought to your hearts and you were a morally depraved people
He who does not believe in Allah and His Messenger with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues must realize that Allah has prepared for those who deny Him, the fierce blazes of Hell
To Allah belong the control and the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; He forgives whom He will and justly subjects to pain and suffering whom He will and He has always been Ghafurun (Forgiving), and Rahimun (Merciful)
And now that these the stay-at-home Arabs find you Muhammad ready to launch an attack, and expect you to lead your army back laden with the spoils -of Khaiber– they will say to you: " Allow us to go with you ", thereby exchanging Allah's word for theirs. Say to them: " You shall not come with us, for thus early has Allah said". They will say to you: "You only fear that we share with you what you hope to keep for yourselves". How little indeed do they comprehend a circumstance
Say O Muhammad to those stay-at-home Arabs: "You will be called upon to make your march for a land whose people face danger with boldness, firmness and courage and they exercise powerful and vehement opposition, and you are expected to war against them unless they, of their own free will, submit and surrender their very selves to Allah". "And if you comply with Allah's command, He will requite you graciously, but if you should change your minds and turn back as you did before, He shall afflict you with a condign punishment
Absolved from guilt shall be the blind and the lame and he who is sick. He who obeys Allah and His Messenger, will Allah welcome into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, and he who turns a deaf ear will Allah subject to a condign punishment
How well pleased has Allah been with the believers whose hearts reflect the image of virtues as they were making the vow to you under the tree to devote themselves to Allah and to serve His purpose; He knew well what they had at heart and that they made the vow with the deepest feeling. Therefore He inspired them with peace and tranquility and decreed to reward them with a victory that is quite near
This is besides the gains which will come exclusively into their possession consequent on the event, and Allah has always been Azizun (Almighty), and Hakimun (Wise)
Allah has given you a Divine assurance of future gains to come into your possession, and so He expedited for you this event (of concluding peace treaty at Hodaibyiah) and He held back the people’s hands from a hostile course of action against you so that it comes to be a sign; an act of miraculous nature serving to demonstrate Divine power; authority. He is well intentioned to guide you to the path of safety and righteousness
He -Allah- also gave you a Divine assurance of other future gains which are in the gripping hands of your antagonists whom you have not been able to overpower; Allah has beset them on all sides, and Allah has always been Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things
Had the infidels warred against you -at Hodaibyiah- they would have withdrawn hastily and taken flight and never would they have found any who would fight for their safety nor any who would afford them help
This is a course of action adopted by Allah and has long been pursued, and you people shall not find a change in Allah's mode of action
It was He who held back the hands of your enemy as well as your hands from a hostile course of action against each other (at Hodaibyiah) in the precincts of Macca, after He had helped you win the victory over them. Allah has always had sight of what you do
These Meccans are they who have persistently denied Allah and stood in your way to obstruct your course to the Sacrosanct Mosque and the offering to where it be scarified; Had it not been for treading injuriously, unawares, upon the faithful believers -men and women-residing among these Meccans, which believers you did not know nor could you recognize, and the error of injuring them would be a crime, We would have allowed you to make a march for Macca; Allah extends His mercy to whom He will. Had they- the unknown believers- been dissimilar in appearance We would have afflicted the infidels among them -the Meccans- with a condign punishment
While the infidels cherished the violent feeling and furious passion of paganism and national ignorance, Allah inspired peace and tranquility to His Messenger and to the faithful believers whose hearts He imprinted with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and whose works with wisdom and whose words with piety; virtues they merit and of right belong to them, Allah has always been Alimun (Omniscient) of all things in all respects
Allah, well intentioned, fulfilled what He presented to His Messenger’s mind in his sleep: "You" Allah said, "Shall enter the Sacrosanct Mosque, Allah willing, with peace of mind and rightly free from apprehension, with heads shaved by some and hair cut short by others, free of fear". Allah takes the matters of fact He knows and you do not, and circumstances them in His own manner and He accorded you besides Hodaibyiah quite a near event
It is He who has sent His Messenger to transmit the spirit of truth to guide people into all truth, and to proclaim by public discourse the Quran featuring the appropriate system of Faith and worship conforming with truth and agreeing with reality. A Quran serving as the criterion and the canon wherein Providence is the guide; it aligns and makes unanimous the course of action, of thought and of life of all concerned, Muslims and Non Muslims whose religious practices are contingent upon man - made related aspects of the one religion whose unclouded and authoritative front is Islam; and good enough for you people is this testimony on the part of Allah
Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, and those with him are unrelenting in combat with those who deny Allah but thoughtful of each other, loving and affectionate among themselves. You see them kneeling in supplication and prostrating in adoration in quest of Allah's efficacious grace and making His good will their aim. Their countenances bear evidence of prostrating their reason to Divine Revelation and their looks are bright, beaming with hope. This is the product of a sequence of events portrayed as such in the graphic appearance described thus early in AL-Tawrah (the Torah) and AL-Injil (the Bible). It is a picture standing similitude exact of a seed which began to spring, putting forth its stalk which grew stronger and stronger. It supported leaves, flowers and fruits, displaying a spectacular and imposing situation distressing those who deny Allah and throwing them into mental disorder and discomposure. To those of them, whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds of wisdom and piety, has Allah promised a gracious reward
O you who believe with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with works imprinted with wisdom and piety: Do not precede Allah and His Messenger in expressing judgment or belief, view or notion and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; He is Sami'un (Omnipresent with unlimited audition) and Alimun (Omniscient)
O you who believe with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety: Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Messenger, nor speak to him loudly in the manner you speak to one another lest unawares your hopes should be doomed to disappointment and your deeds to worthlessness
Indeed, those who lower their voices when they have audience with the Messenger of Allah arc those whose style in discourse reveals their character which is imbued with Grace divine, and whose breast has Allah filled with reverence and piety; they merit forgiveness and a great reward
Those who call you O Muhammad, from without the chambers of your wives; most of them do not have the sense nor the knowledge of how to act under given conditions
If they had reconsidered it and decided more wisely to wait quietly until you have come out, it would have been better for them, but Allah is Ghafurun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual Virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety: If ever there comes to you someone known to be immoral or potentially harmful, pernicious, malicious or mischievous, and relates to you a message or an event, an incident or something he heard, then be objectively certain of the truth to preclude risk of error and the consequence of wrong action and of injuring the reputation of a people or defaming them in ignorance, and later be pitifully regretful for what you have done
And you must realize that the Messenger of Allah is in your midst. If he were to a submit to your wishes and yield to you in many of the matters, you would be befallen with misfortunes, But Allah has touched your hearts with the divine hand to create in them affection for the Faith and to make you regard it with an eye of favour, He made you hate disbelief, immorality and disobedience with heart and hand. Such persons arc those who follow the path of safety and righteousness
This is Allah's divine influence operating in men to regenerate and sanctify, to impart strength to endure trial and resist temptation; an efficacious grace effecting the end for which it is given; Allah is Alimun and Hakimun (Wise)
If two parties, bodies, states or nations in their corporate character, among those who sincerely believe in Allah should engage in warfare against each other, then you reconcile them and bring about peace between them. And if one of them wrongs the other, then you fight against the one exercising injustice, prejudice or harshness, until they conform to divine commands If they do, then reconcile one to the other in accordance with reason and justice, and exercise authority in maintenance of right. Allah entertains a great regard for those who vindicate the right
Indeed, the believers whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety are fellow-members of the Faith; an association of brothers. So reconcile your brothers with one another and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah that you may merit His mercy
O you who believe with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds of wisdom and piety: Men must not laugh at other men with the intention of producing a specified deriding, or ridiculing, or contemptuous effect upon one another. It may be that the laughees are better than the laughers in many aspects. Nor should women laugh at other women with the intention of producing a specified deriding or ridiculing, or contemptuous effect upon one another. It may be that the laughees are better than the laughers in many aspects. Moreover do not defame one another nor nickname each other by insulting or repulsive derogatory names. How bad it is to be called malicious or wicked after having professed the Faith with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety! And he who does not change his mind with regard to past conduct, then such persons are guilty of wrongful actions. "The man that dares traduce because he can, with safety to himself, is not a man " "Cowper" Suspicion in some instances is indeed a sin
O you who believe with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety. Avoid suspicion in many instances and the conjecture of the existence of something evil or wrong without proof; suspicion in some instances is indeed a sin. Nor play the spy upon each other or peer inquisitively and impertinently into the nature of other peoples' actions, nor traduce or slander one another by speaking evil or falsehood or speaking maliciously behind his or her back. Would any of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother! Indeed you would shrink from it with horror. Therefore, keep Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, Allah is indeed Tawabun (Relenting) and Rahimun (Merciful). Allah indicates to people that He weighs them not by their parentage, lineage, descent or rank in life, but by the image their hearts reflect
O you people; We created you from the union of a twain, male and female, and We divided you into nations and communities and dispersed you over the earth to get to know each other and not to boast your descent or rank. The one among you whom Allah values most and is held precious in His esteem is he who keeps Allah in mind and acquaints his heart with wisdom, and regards Allah with breast filled with reverential awe. Allah is Alimun, and Khabirun (intimately acquainted with all things). A tribe named Banu Asad went to Madinab, where the Messenger had emigrated, seeking relief for their families by reason whereof a famine had ensued that year. They had conformed to Islam, but they thought at that stage that they had become absorbed in the Faith, which they were not. Consequently, Allah defines to them and to the people at large the stages they go through
(The desert Arabs say to the Messenger); "We are strongly disposed to believe in Allah and obey His ordinances." Say to them O Muhammad: "You have not yet been absorbed in the Faith, but you may say; "We have conformed to Islam". But not yet have your hearts been impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. If you obey Allah and the voice and reason of His Messenger, Allah will not depreciate the reward of your good deeds; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
Indeed, true believers are those who have solemnly believed in Allah and His Messenger with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety and never since have they had a reason to occasion doubt or uncertainty. They strove with their money and their lives in the cause of Allah Whose purpose has been the heart of their purpose. These are indeed the true to their promises and to their Faith and as true as the needle to the pole
Ask to them O Muhammad: "Are you going to inform Allah of what operates on your character and will, and what accrued from your apprehension of Allah knows fully all in all in the heaven; and on earth and He is Alimun of the divine truth all in all
They oblige you O Muhammad and make you feel indebted to them for having conformed to Islam. Say to them: "Do not obligate me for conforming to Islam, but Allah rather is He Who obligates you for opening your hearts' ears and your minds' eyes and influencing your appetite to Faith if indeed you are true to your promises and to your Faith
Allah is indeed Omniscient of all that is invisible and unknown and of all that is secretly disposed in the heavens and the earth and He holds prescience of all events and of all private thoughts and feelings that are reposited in the breasts. He is Bassirun and (He sees all that you do)
Qaf, and by what it represents and what it stands for as a natural symbol of adoration, and by the distinguished Quran featuring the glory of Allah Who is the final cause of creation and the highest aim of intelligent creatures
There is no reason to marvel at the recognition of a man who came to you people from your midst as a spectacle and a warning to you all and you refuse to accept him in his capacity and the infidels say: " It is indeed strange
How can We be raised after death when we have been reduced to dust?" "This idea of Resurrection, studiously sought out, is indeed far fetched
But We Have already and thus early known to what extent has the earth consumed of the corpses of their dead, (or it may be; what the earth shall regularly consume of them by death) We keep a book where everything is related in writing and set down in a permanent form
Yet the infidels denied the truth when it was presented to them and treated the Messenger as one who passes himself as someone other than he is, as if they were involved in doubt and anxiety about a matter on account of its intricate character
Did they not direct their intellectual eye at the heaven above them with its regions, spheres, realms of space and celestial bodies, and ponder how skillfully, powerfully and authoritatively did We construct and furnish with ornaments and with qualities that give distinction and render impossible any flaws
And the earth* how We spread and stretch out and furnished with mountains placed in a certain setting, fixed as with an anchor, and therein did We produce and cause to grow a set of every kind of variegated vegetation
To impart insight of the mind and an admonition to be put in mind of every votary devoted to religious observances with breast filled with reverential awe
And how We sent down from the floor of the vault of heaven showers of blessed rain and with its instrumentality did We vegetate orchards and grain to be reaped and gathered in
And the tallish -palm- trees with pinnates of fan-shaped leaves and sprouting offshoots of variegated and delicious fruits
And how with rain We produce victuals for the people and restore life to a dead land ! and so also shall be Resurrection
Long before them - the Meccans - did the people of Nuh (Noah) and those of the town of Rass and those of Thamud (the Thamudites), suspect their Messengers of falsehood
And so did the people of 'Ad the -'Adites- and those of Pharaoh and the contemporaries of Lut (Lot)
And similarly did the forest dwellers and the people of the King of Yemen, all of whom suspected their Messengers, of falsehood, and there, was fulfilled the prophecy of the punitive event to the wicked
Did We grow weary and worn out with fatigue with the first creation that you people suspect the validity of a new creation
It was We Who created man and brought him into being and We know, what his innermost being suggests secretly to his mind and what his breast forges, and We -Our angels- are closer to him than his own neck vein
Two angels sit as receivers by his sides, right and left, to take delivery of all that he advances of actions with reference to rendering an account of his life and conduct to Allah
Nothing he utters and expresses in words, be it under his breath or openly disclosed but is related in writing by the two angels who keep a watchful guard
Then, there comes the occasion when he sinks into a stupor indicating the near approach of the encounter with death; "This is," he is told, "what you tried hard to evade
Then, comes the moment when the trumpet is sounded; this is the Day against which a cautious notice has been given
And now comes every soul driven to its destiny by one of the watchful angels, accompanied by a witness to give evidence in relation to matters of fact (be it the other watchful angel or the deeds done)
He will be told: "you did not perceive nor did you heed this Day; and so, now that We have unveiled your mind's eyes , you shall apprehend with acute perception and see through a brick wall
Then shall the spokesman of the two watchful guards who accompanied him in life say: "Here I present his true account ready prepared and put in order
Then, the two watchful guards are told: "Cast into Hell every one who denied Allah, who had been headstrong, self-willed and pertinacious in adhering to his own wrong and did not yield readily to admonition
Who was an opponent of a good deed and a hinderer of benevolence, symbolic of transgressive infirmity and disposed to suspicion
Who incorporated with Allah another deity and so put him to the torment laid upon the damned
His satanic friend or companion will say: "My Creator, I never incited him to evil; he was already and thus early an opinionated man who had erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep
Then will Allah say: "Do not altercate with each other in My presence; I had already and thus early sent you a spectacle and a warning and Books and narratives by which moral and spiritual relations are typically set forth
No statement that has been affirmed will be altered at this stage, in the presence, in defense or vindication of one's conduct nor am I unjust to My servants
The day shall come when We ask Hell "Are you now to the full?" and it will say: "Are there no more
And Paradise will be brought near to those who keep Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, and it will be in their sight
This is the bliss promised to
Who is influenced by profound respect and reverence and stands in awe of Allah Whom he cannot apprehend by sight and departs this life with a clean heart that has been impressed with wisdom and piety
Such persons will be welcomed into the beatitude of heaven: " Enter you people into My mercy, Allah says, and take up your abode in My Paradise with peace of mind, of soul and of conscience; peace be on you; this is the Day of timelessness and Eternity
Therein, they will have whatever object of desire from which pleasure or satisfaction is expected, and any wish they express in words or is suggested to the mind will be instantly fulfilled, and of everything We have available and at will, and much more
How many generations before them -the Meccans-, mightier than them in power, did We destine to destruction, and how soon did their mightiness meet misery! They wandered about not knowing where, in quest of a means of escaping death, but is there any
Indeed, there is what is commendable in this narrative and worthy of acceptance and regard for him whose heart has been touched with the Divine hand and has opened his heart's ears and his mind's eyes and has witnessed the ground for belief tending to prove the conclusion
We created the heavens and the earth in six days* determined by Allah's own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar and never were We worn, out with fatigue
Therefore in patience O Muhammad possess you your soul; praise the glory of your Creator and extoll His glorious attributes before sunrise and before sunset
And at some part of the night and after the concluding part of prostrating yourself in the act of worship and the formal ending of prayer
And you shall listen on the Day when the announcer proclaims Resurrection and makes it manifest to the senses from a near distance to all: the Moment of Judgement
This is the Day when all shall hear the exploding annunciation of the matter of fact so announced; this is the Day of Resurrection
It is We who give life and inspirit the property of animate existence, and occasion death and deprive of animate existence, and to Us shall all return
This is the Day the earth over the dead shall crack and everyone will be embodied by his soul, and they will then emerge from the graves rushing to their Fate and nothing is easier than to throng the resurrected to Judgment
We know best what they -the infidels- say, and you O Muhammad never forced them to follow you or your admonition nor did you erect among them tyrannies. Therefore, keep reminding people of their duty to Allah, their Creator, and proclaim the Quran to those who regard Allah's warning with reverence and awe, tinged with latent fear
By the air in motion with any degree of force perceptible to the senses, conveying physical phenomena and distributing them over the universe
And by the visible mass of condensed watery vapour floating at various heights in the upper air
And by the vessels, small or stately, floating on water propelled by the wind upon the sails or propelled by other means
And by the angels, the attendants and divine Messengers of Allah, who minister the affairs of mankind and all other beings, and apportion to each what is determined by Allah
That all that affords a ground of expectation of good and blessing, mercy and forgiveness to those whose deeds reflect wisdom and piety, and of retributive but just punishment to those who have denied Allah and challenged His ordinances, is consistent with the truth and agrees with reality
And that the final trial of mankind at the end of the world is indeed an inevitable event that shall fall to. their lot
By the heaven with its infinite expanse, its spheres, its imposing elevation and the inlaid patterns of bright gold
You people are indeed at variance in your statements and beliefs, discordant in your reasons and resolutions and it is evident that variance of opinion proves error somewhere
whereas the path of Allah is the path of safety and righteousness and His Quran features Him as the guide; it is resolute, and no one rejects it but him who befools his mind and judgment of it, so as to cause what is false to be accepted as true
Denunciated, then, are those who suspect their Messengers of falsehood, make doubt and always give occasion to uncertainty
Who are sunk in pleasure with brains swimming with the thought of disbelief, immersed in strong delusion that they should believe a lie and disbelieve the truth
And contemptuously and insolently ask: " When will that alleged Day of Judgment fall to our lot
The Day shall come when, then, the faggot will be fried and they will fry in their own grease and suffer the consequences of their own folly
And there and then will they be scornfully told: "Taste with all your senses the unbearable sensation coming over your bodies by being cast into Hell Fire. This is what you always challenged be hastened on and there, did your minutes hasten to your end
But the righteous who keep Allah in mind and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him will take abode in gardens of surpassing beauty ornamented with beautiful springs
satisfied with what Allah has fulfilled of their wish and their desire and expectation; they were charitable in life and they performed their duties to the best
They hardly missed a night but apportioned part of it, be it little or much, to divine worship at the expense of their sleep
And they entreated Allah humbly when the stars became invisible at the gleam of dawn: "O Allah they prayed, to err is human, to forgive is divine. We beseech your forgiveness of our errors and our iniquities if we had inadvertently done any
And they apportioned a determinate share of their wealth to distribute among the needy who make requests for aid, and among those without the means of bare subsistence and among the faint souls past corporal toil
On earth are countless signs of miraculous nature serving to demonstrate divine power, omnipotence and authority; signs clearly recognized by those whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand
And signs within yourselves: (bodily structure, organization and development, the characteristic appearance of an individual or a race, the vital functions and countless other signs): can you not see
And in heaven rest your livelihood and the means of sustaining life, and all that you have been promised of bliss for the righteous and suffering for the wicked
And so, by the Maker of the heavens and the earth: all of which promise has been made, is as true as the needle to the pole and as true as you express yourselves in words
Have you heard O Muhammad of the narrative of the disguised guests of Ibrahim (Abraham) on whom he imparted honour and respect
They entered in the presence, and greeted him with the expression of good will "Peace" and he met them with the dictum of welcome " Peace " stranger guests
He Quickly went in to his household and placed an order for a meal to be served to the guests, then he came back with a fatted roasted calf
He set it before them and cordially said: "Would you not like to eat!" but when they did not
back he recoiled apprehensive and pervaded with fear, but they consoled him and in good will they said: "Do not be afraid " and they authoritatively made to him the intimation of the coming of a well informed and wise son who would have a sound judgment and the ability to perceive and adopt the best means for accomplishing an end
His wife overheard the statement and, in astonishment and wonder caused by the unexpected, she came up with an outcry. She smote her face and said: "what impossible matter will you guests make easy next?" "An old woman who lived barren all her life
They said: "Thus says Allah, your Creator," "He it is, Who is indeed, AL- Hakim (the Wise), AL-Alim (the Omniscient)
And now, said Ibrahim to his guests, "what is the purpose of your visit, O you itinerant messengers
They said: " we have been sent to a sinful people who willfully violated all religious and moral principles
To drive, with impetuous violence against them stones of clay inflammable- ore; (probably brimstone)
Set apart and intended for the extravagant in their accounts of themselves who rove beyond just limits and beyond prescribed observances, and exceed what is proper and reasonable
We had predetermined to deliver those inhabitants whose hearts were impressed with religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety, but the only inhabitant who qualified was Lut himself
And We did not find more than one single house whose household had accepted the Faith, and that was Lut's household excluding his wife
We made the event cast its shadows which We left as a sign serving to convey an intimation and to demonstrate divine power and omnipotence to those who fear greatly the eternally tormenting punitive punishment
Another sign that bespeaks Allah's Omnipotence and Authority is that of Mussa (Moses) whom We sent to Pharaoh and there did Mussa stand manifest of great authority
But Pharaoh, operating against Mussa by means of a corner, vented what he imagined Mussa to be: "A magician, or one who suffers from demoniacal possession
And so We took a sudden possession of him and his troops, seized them into Our hands and We drove them, like a drove of sheep, into the sea; and this was imputed to him on account of his own evil
And in the case of 'Ad - the 'Adites - We drove against them a cold terrifying and destructive hurricane, merciless, pitiless and unrelenting
Nothing did it touch but it reduced to ruin and decay
And in the case of Thamud -the Thamudites-, they were told: "You are granted respite, to experience with delight, for further consideration of the matter until the coming of a certain date
But they insolently defied the command of Allah, and were consequently destroyed by an overwhelming thunderous convulsion of the earth's surface produced by a natural force within the earth's crust in broad daylight
And so they could not assume an erect attitude on their own feet nor were they able to protect or defend themselves
And similarly did We strike a blow at the people of Nuh before them; they were indeed a sinful people
And the heaven with its regions, spheres and realms of space did We skillfully, powerfully and authoritatively construct and We are expanding the universe
And the earth did We spread out* and invest and adorn as with blazonry, and how artistically was it prepared for life and blazoned
And of everything, spiritual, animate and inanimate, did We create pairs complementing each other: (night and day, positive and negative, love and aversion, rest and fatigue, mercy and punishment, sea and land, light and darkness, belief and disbelief, life and death, happiness and misery, heaven and Hell, male and female, …). (And when We come to the universe as a whole, there is He Who complements it and sustains it; He is One and He does not need anything to complement Him), that you people may hopefully ponder
Therefore," says the Messenger, " you people have no end to serve but the truth; hasten then to Allah and resort to Him. He is the only guide to the path of safety and righteousness, and He sent me to be a spectacle and a warning to you all
And do not incorporate with Him another deity; look to yourselves; I am your spectacle who gives you a fair warning
Bear with them O Muhammad; no Messenger that was sent to the people before them but they unjustly labeled him a sorceror or a demoniac
Is this the legacy of thought they legated one generation to another ! But they are indeed a people given to disobedience, and heaven has laid their transgression to their charge
Therefore, keep away from them O Muhammad; you stand exculpated on all charges, nor will you incur imputation of demerit on account of a fault you have not done; you have done your duty to the best
But keep reminding people of their duty to Allah, proclaiming His message, for making the message known shall benefit those whose hearts are impressed with the image of virtue and whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety
I have not created the Jinn and mankind but to recognize Me, serve Me and to worship Me with appropriate acts and rites
No livelihood or maintenance do I require from them nor do I expect them to feed Me
For, indeed, Allah is He Who is the sole sustainer Who keeps the whole and all in all in existence and causes them to continue in a certain state; the Omnipotent Who does not grow weary and He is the Sole authority to Whom belongs the controlling power over the universe
Therefore, those who exercised injustice and worked iniquities and were wrongful of actions, must expect the fatal consequence uniting them with the fellows of their crime, and so they had better not challenge it be hastened on
In consequence, denunciated shall be those who denied Allah and rejected His ordinances, and how woeful shall be the day which they have been promised
I swear by the Mount, the chosen ground for the disclosure of knowledge to man from the realm of heaven
And by the Sacred Book inscribed by the scribes of Allah who put into words all that He pronounces to them and accords with deep respect, reverence and veneration
Standing as a specific feature upon scrolls when pen was put to paper to become disclosed to view and proclaimed authoritatively
And by the Ka' ba like " Holy of Holies " in heavens realm which is continually visited by succession of angels to engage in the act of worship, (or the Sacrosanct House that is frequently populated)
And by the vault of the floor of heaven sitting aloft and featuring imposing elevation
And by the sea which is filled with life and motion and swallows water to its fill
That your Creator's punitive punishment, stored for those who deny Him, shall come to pass
And there is just not any expedient nor anyone in the heaven's realm or on earth that can avert it
A day shall come when the heaven sways from side to side in dreadful, commotion
And the mountains grow tremulous, in response to the command of their Maker, and they go stump and shiver into atoms blown up by the wind
There and then, denunciated shall be those who denied Allah and rejected the truth and suspected their Messenger of falsehood
Who amused themselves in idle talk and were given to indulging in personal vanity and drowned themselves in the nonsensical
This will be the day when they shall be forced into the fire of Hell wherein they are pushed head-long
And they will be told " This is the permanent abode where you are set ablaze and tortured by burning; this is the Hell you had always denied
Now, do you see it a reality! or is it also an illusive appearance and a secret and overmastering influence resembling magic in its effect? or is it that you have lost sight
Now, you are put to torture by the fire which avenges wrong and punishes crime. And whether you bear it patiently or impatiently, you bear enough wrongs that it serves you right
Whereas those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah shall take abode in gardens of bliss and surpassing beauty in the beatitude of heaven and enter into the grace of Allah, their Creator
Rejoicing beyond a common joy at the answer to their prayer, exhilarating with what Allah has conferred on them, and jubilant that He has saved them from torture in the pit of Hell
And they will be told: " Eat and drink and enjoy all that affords pleasure in return for the deeds you had done with wisdom and piety
Reclining on throne - like lounges ranked in rows which each is destined to ascend, and Allah will wed them to beauties whose eyes radiate splendour that no one could have conceived in life
And those whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds - wisdom and piety, and their progeny walked after them accepting their authority and example in faith, even thus their deeds be of a lesser calibre, will still be fitted for companionship together without being an expense to their fathers, and without making inroads on justice, for this is only Allah's grace. He confers it on whom He will, and every soul shall be pledged for its deeds
We will provide them with delicious fruits and the meat of their choice and they will be fitted with whatever they desire
They will be served with a drink which gives a rapturous feeling of bliss and beautitude, and never does it induce them to discourse matters of little value or insignificance, nor do they hear ill tongues or what is morally evil
They will be Served by their handsome attendants whose figures in conjunction with stateliness, and their beauty in conjunction with dignity are eternal, as like as precious pearls, gracefully adorned as with blazonry affording keen pleasure to the sense of sight and charms the intellectual and moral faculties
They will convey the thoughts reciprocally in talk, holding discourse of past events in life, relative to their affairs and actions, responses and reactions
In life 'they add' " as we lived among our own families, we always worried about such things concerning their fortune here and Hereafter, besides taking concern in the foreordained consequences which would naturally attend our undertakings here and Hereafter
But how gracious has Allah been to us; He did not render us liable to the punitive punishment in the scorching flames of Hell
We had always prayed and beseeched Him in life to create in us a clean heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and to imprint our deeds with wisdom and piety; He it is AL-Burro (the Beneficent) and AL-Rahim (the Merciful)
Therefore, keep O Muhammad reminding people of their duty to Allah, proclaiming His message. You are a spectacle and a warning to them all, and not as they contemptuously claim, a fortune - teller, nor are you demoniac
Or do they insolently say: " He is a poet, he can fool the people some of the time; we will keep him in view to observe his actions until the encounter with death
Say to them: "You just remain in waiting in your condition and be ready for some expected event, and I Shall also remain in waiting for the same expected event
Or is it the hope they found on a basis of a mental concept of what is not true, or on what they see in a dream or a vision steering their feeble minds to an unwarranted course of action, or is it on a basis of obstinacy and transgression
Or do they say that this is what your breast has forged that your tongue must vent? Indeed, their hearts' ears are closed and this is the reason they counsel deaf to admonition
Let them, then, produce an informative, discourse, inducing to duties and admonitory, in the similitude of the Quran, if they can truly bring forth their strong reasons
Or have they been created by chance, or are they the creators or supreme beings who created all things
Or was it they who created the heavens and the earth and caused them to exist? Indeed they have a strong disposition to deny their Maker
Or are they in possession of your Creator's treasuries that they take them for their own, or is it they who take them into their control besides control of the universe, its beginning and its end
Or do they have a ladder for ascent to the heaven's realm to gather information upon the listen. If so, then let their attentive hearer furnish the action of evidence in convincing the mind
Or is it that to Allah belong only the daughters whom they incorporate with Him, and to them belong only the sons
Or do you ask of them a pay for the Divine message you deliver to them, that they have been burdened with a heavy debt
Or do they realize the unseen or have knowledge of the invisible not apprehended by sight, and they commit it to writing
Or do they only mean your annoyance and affliction with mental agitation, anxiety and trouble? But those who deny Allah shall suffer the annoyance and the grievous affliction of their minds
Or do they regard with reverence another deity other than Allah who has power over nature and the fortunes of mankind? Glory to Allah in the highest; He is the final cause of creation and the highest moral aim of intelligent creaturs, and far exalted is He above all those they incorporate with Him
And if it so happens that they see a mass (sometimes devastating) falling from the sky, they would label it as a cumulus nimbus
Therefore, leave them until they are faced, on some future date, with their settling day, when they are suddenly visited with an overwhelming punishment striking them at the root
A day on which none of their plans and plots, secretly or openly contrived, purposed to accomplish their wicked purpose, shall avail them or afford them help
And besides that there shall be a punitive and retributive punishment that hits in life those wrongful of actions, performed and executed unjustly and harmfully, but most of them are so ignorant as not to know this fact
In patience possess you your soul, therefore, bear with them O Muhammad and forebear their provocation until your Creator's command comes to pass. We hold you in great esteem and regard, and We keep an eye on you; you just praise His glory and extoll His glorious Names when you get up upon your feet, and when you get up from sleep
And praise His glory and extoll His glorious attributes some part of the night, and when the stars make an apparent descent, or become invisible, at the incipient gleam of dawn
I swear by the celestial body when it goes down to make an apparent descent toward and below the horizon
In confirmation of the truthful attributes of your compatriot Muhammad- who did not err nor stray from the path of safety and righteousness
Nor does he give utterance to words, moved by selfish motives, or utters error against Allah and commits his heart to inequity
But what he relates to you people is nothing other than a Quran revealed to him by inspiration from Allah, and it extends to all subjects treated
A Divine disclosure of knowledge to mankind, instructed to him by the mighty messenger of Allah the Spirit Jibril (Gabriel)
Who is endowed with power, wisdom and capacities of action, and in a majestic imposingly dignified appearance did he come forth into view
At first, when he assumed the astronomical horizon
Then when he moved down toward the visible horizon and came closer and closer
Until the intervening distance between him and Muhammad was no more than two bows length or even closer
And through him -the spirit Jibril- did Allah inspire His servant Muhammad- with whatever was meant to be intimated
He -Muhammad- never devised a falsity nor could he change what his heart's ears have heard nor what his mind's eyes have seen
Wherefore, then do you people argue against what he saw
In effect, he- Muhammad- saw him- the Spirit Gabriel- on another occasion
At the site where he -the Spirit Jibril- took Up his station in the realm of heaven, a site designated " Sidrat Al Montaha "; (interpreted to be the boundary fenced by trees, where no one, spiritual or otherwise can ascend or descend beyond, unless ordained by Allah)
The site which is in close proximity to the heavenly paradise of supreme bliss where the righteous make abode
The site which no one can conceive what embellishment overlays it, a Sidra ornamented by what no eye has seen nor ear heard
He -Muhammad- never turned aside, nor did he lose sight of anything he was meant to see at that site, nor did his mind's eyes wander here or there
What he saw was indeed beyond human comprehension; he saw some of his Creator's wonders and signs serving to demonstrate Divine power and omnipotence
Do you -Meccans- see the idols Al Lat and Al 'Uzza you honour and revere and regard with extreme respect and devotion
And the other idol - Manat - third of the group
Have you chosen the idol you designated as male and left to Allah what you designated as female
But this is quite an unfair distribution
These are nothing but names you and your forefathers have designated and destined to the purpose of worship; names never authorized by Allah nor sanctioned. by Him They only follow the false suppositions and the incitement arising from the state of their minds and feeling albeit they have received from Allah the spirit of truth guiding them into all truth
Or does man think that whatever he wishes or desires is law
But to Allah belong the future and the present, the end and the beginning, all things to be and all that has been, and Hereafter and here
A good many angels in the heaven's realm cannot intercede on behalf of any being nor does their intercession avail any, unless Allah permits, and then, only on behalf of whom He accepts
Indeed, it is only those who deny Allah and Day of Judgement that designate the angels as females and add such feminine names to the angels' proper appellation
Yet they lack the knowledge giving firm belief of what is true on sufficient grounds, and they follow an emotion, they imagine, will direct them to the attainment and possession of the object from which, in their view, satisfaction is expected. But never does an unverified supposition or an opinion offered on insufficient presumptive evidence replace the truth or conformity with fact
Therefore, keep away O Muhammad from those who refuse to acknowledge Our message and choose to go by the world with eyes ever fixed upon worldly matters
For this is the ultimate end and the highest attainable point of their intellectual acquaintance with, and perception of, the facts and the truth. Allah is He Who knows best those who wandered from His path, the path of righteousness, and those who have been guided by the spirit of truth into all truth
To Allah belong all that exists in the heavens and on earth individually and all together, and all that exists in fact or in idea, and that which is or may be in anyway an object of perception, knowledge, or thought, and that which is done or to be done, and the attribute and the quality of every being in all respects besides all affairs, concerns and matters, so that He justly requites those whose works reflect the image of evil, and rewards those whose hearts are impressed with the image of virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety
Those who avoid major sins and do not commit themselves to an evil line of conduct, but occasionally fall into mistakes, faults or errors may find Allah Ghafrun (Forgiving),and Rahimun (Merciful); He knows well your nature, your character, and condition of mind besides your disposition and your temperament; for it is He Who brought you into being from the earth, then He embedded you in your mothers' wombs; therefore justify not yourselves before him; He knows best those whose hearts are impressed with the image of virtues and whose deeds with wisdom and piety
Have you seen O Muhammad the one whose attitude has served to disincline him from reverence to Allah and to all that He has ordained
And when he gives he gives a little, be it what confers somewhat to the need or comfort of others or rendering a service, or giving one his due, or imparting knowledge, or giving help in some way or another, and yet he stops short and gives grudgingly
Does he have knowledge of what is to be, or will be, or does he know the unknown and realize the unseen and the events yet to happen and therefore he perceives them mentally or in a dream or vision or by sight
Has he not been informed of the contents of the Books of Mussa (Moses)
And of Ibrahim (Abraham) whose vows pledged to Allah, he faithfully fulfilled
That no soul bearing wrongs shall in any way bear the wrong actions of another
That nothing is considered one's own in Day of Judgment but only what he strove for and had endeavoured to attain
And that the advantages of his efforts will be seen later in the course of events and the fruits of his endeavours will ripen and glow here and Hereafter
Then will the end crown the deed and Allah shall requite him in full for the actions involving godly efforts directed to a definite end and for the deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety
Does he not also know that to Allah goes all, and is summed up in the ultimate state which is the end and the purpose for which all in all are destined
And that it is He Who created the emotion expressed by laughing with or without tears, and the emotion expressed by lamenting with tears and weeping out one's eyes or one's heart
And that it is He Who caused the assemblage of certain functional activities to manifest the property of-life, and it is He Who deprives of these activities and occasions death
And that it is He Who created the two sex divisions of organic beings and distinguished them as male and female
And that He derived these two sex divisions of organic beings from the male seed (Notfa) when emitted
And that it is He who shall effect the second creation when He restores the dead to life for judgment at the Last Day
And that He it is who gives possessions and abundant means; He makes people abound in wealth or natural resources, and it is He Who enriches man with heavenly grace or contents by the fulfillment of a desire or the supply of a want, and it is He Who effects the satisfaction and contented state of mind
And that He is it Who is the Creator of the dog star (the Sirius)
And that it was He Who annihilated the ancient most powerful earlier generations of the people of 'Ad -the first Adites- and raised their cities to the ground
And likewise did He annihilate the strong and talented people of Thamud (the Thamudites) and left not one survivor
And before them did He blot out of existence the people of Nuh (Noah) who never observed the principles of justice and were most disposed to be obstinately contrary to what is true, and continued to go counter to what is reasonable or required
And it was He Who brought to ruin and reduced to impotence the cities old Sodom and Gomorrah
To a degree inconceivable in imagination as to how they were berried the way they were
Therefore, which of your Creator's attributes, O man, gives you occasion to uncertainty and makes you undecided in belief
He, your compatriot Muhammad is a spectacle and a warning of a like kind to the earlier spectacles and warnings to you all
The inevitable Day of Judgment is drawing near
And no one but Allah can open up its point of time to the knowledge of the people
Does this discourse affect your emotion you people and excite your wonder
And you laugh to scorn and manifest contempt, instead of weeping out your eyes and your hearts
And you express disapproval and decline to accept the message, searching hard for an error to help you refute your Messenger
You had better bow down in adoration to Allah your Creator, and prostrate your reason to His omnipotence, and pay to Him reverence and adoration
The final hour, (that is the Day of Judgment), is drawing near and the moon will be cleft asunder, lose orbit and be disrupted
Yet whenever they see an act of a miraculous nature serving to demonstrate Divine power, and omnipotence, authority and ground for belief, they look upon it as a secret and overmastering influence intended to shake their beliefs and they assert emphatically that such magic as the Messenger enchants them by, is doomed to failure and his hopes will be doomed to disappointment
They denied the truth when it was presented to them and treated the Messenger as one who passes himself off as someone other than he is and they followed their own lustful course and a religion of a sensuous character. But every event has its determined time and place
In fact they have received narratives of the fate of those who denied Allah; narratives instructive and informative enough to induce them to reject the path of falsehood and recourse to the path of safety and righteousness
But what good is an utmost wisdom or a wise dispensation providence to people devoid of insight and their hearts' ears are deaf and their minds' eyes are blind
Pay no attention to them O Muhammad; there shall come the day of the horrendous Event when the announcer among the angels intimates to them the painful and disturbing news of the unwelcome occurrence of the imminent judicious hearing and judgment
Incensed by humiliation reflecting their multiplied wrongs, they will emerge from the graves with downcast eyes in throngs like locusts clustering in myriads
Responding to the call expeditiously and sensing, as infidels who denied Allah, what awaits them of horror and ghastly dread, they admit: " This is indeed going to be a distressful day
The people of Nuh (Noah) in earlier times refused to admit the truth of Our message, and renounced Our servant -the Messenger- and accused him of being demoniac and they gave him a lick with the rough sides of their tongues and called him everything they could lay their tongues to
Nuh made devout and humble supplication to Allah praying His aid: "My Creator", he said, " thus far I have been defeated, and the wickedness of my people may defeat Your cause. My Creator, this is a just cause for ground of action
We opened the gates of heaven and poured down copious, impetuous and torrential rain sufficient to deluge the world
And We made the earth break forth into sudden action and made the water rush violently and copiously forcing springs and passages impetuously through, and the two waters met to accord in one to occasion the event foreordained for those who were wicked
And We carried him Nuh on an ark constructed with planks fittest together and trusted to save him and his crew from shipwreck
And We kept the ark afloat by Our command, keeping an eye on it and closely observing it with Our blessings to guard them home and reward those within and punish those without
And We left it as a sign serving to convey an intimation; an act of a miraculous nature serving to demonstrate Divine power and omnipotence and so, is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes
And how painful was My punishment imposed on those who counselled deaf to admonition and wasted their lives and refused to acknowledge their Messenger
We made the Quran conducive to ease, facile in discourse, easy to remember and a guide to the path of righteousness, and so, is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes
So did the people of 'Ad - the 'Adites -; they refused to admit the truth of Our message and they renounced their Messenger. How painful was My punishment on those who counselled deaf to admonition and wasted their lives and refused to acknowledge their Messenger
We drove against them, on an unlucky and a miserable day, a fierce cold wind swallowing the ground with fierceness and rage, vehement and merciless, roaring for punishing crime
Setting people flying and springing upon the ground with violence, plucking towns out and leaving nothing standing as if they were palm- trees torn up by the roots
And so, how painful was My punishment imposed on those who counselled deaf to admonition and wasted their lives and refused to acknowledge their Messenger
We made the Quran conducive to ease, facile in discourse, easy to remember and a guide to the path of righteousness; and so is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes
And likewise acted -the Thamudites-; they disbelieved their Messenger and they obstinately refused to listen to the warning against impending danger and misfortune
They said: "Is it in conformity with correct reasoning that one human among us and of human character would be the leader to follow? " We would be indeed at variance with what one approves or regards as right, and we would be of unsound mind
Is he the one man taken by preference out of all of us who are available, to carry the divine message?" " Indeed he is a liar
But soon enough shall they know who the liar is
We are sending the she -camel as a trial to prove their wickedness". "And so keep them in view in order to observe their action, and have patience
And tell them that the water is to be distributed among their number including the she-camel, and that each share falls to each in turn
They called upon the leader whose heart was confederate with his hand; which held the knife and disabled the she-camel by cutting her hamstring muscles
And how painful was the punishment imposed on those who counselled deaf to admonition and mis-spent their lives and refused to acknowledge their Messenger
And how great and direful was the one cry* We sent against them from the realm of heaven that they came to be like the bristly stubbles of grain stalks that are left in the ground
We made the Quran conducive to ease, facile in discourse, easy to remember and a guide to the path of righteousness, and so, is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes
Similarly did the people of Lut (Lot); they disbelieved their Messenger and obstinately refused to listen to the warning against impending danger and misfortune for their heinous sin
Therefore, how violent was the brimstone-charged storm We directed toward them from the realm of heaven to annihilate them, excepting Lut's family whom We delivered at the latter part of the night just before it dawned
For they -but not his wife- came in My grace, the efficacious grace which effects to the thankful the end for which it is given
In effect Lut, earlier, had sincerely warned them of our merciless but just retribution but they doubted his warning and continued their evil practice, lured by some sinister star
Even his guests- the two disguised angels- did Lut's people try to take away to seduce and induce them to surrender to their evil sin, hut We blinded their sight and We decreed thus "This day shall they taste My merciless but just retribution for their insolent disregard of My warning
And in the morning We wedded them to an irretrievable and foreordained calamity
And as foreordained: they tasted My merciless but just retribution for their insolent disregard of My warning
We made the Quran conducive to ease, facile in discourse, easy to remember and a guide to the path of righteousness; and so, is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes
Also, the people of Pharaoh received their Messengers -Mussa (Moses) and Haron (Aaron) but they met them with disrespect and resistance and they refused to listen to the warning against impending danger and misfortune
And they ignored all acts of miraculous nature serving to demonstrate Divine power and authority, and so We seized them with such disasters as would be expected only from an Azizun (Almighty) and Moqtadirun (Omnipotent)
Are you pagans -you Meccans- a people of a better sort than those, just mentioned, whose pride got the better of their prudence? Or do you, pagans, have assurances in some sacred Book that you are granted immunity and freedom from a liability to which the others are subjected to
Or do they -the pagans- say: "we are a society that holds together and therefore we are in a position to overcome any adversity and to triumph over misfortune
This host of multitudinous Pagans and idolaters shall be beaten off and put to rout
Further, there awaits them the foreordained unfortunate Hour when they come to judgment and indeed worse and worse, painful and grievous, is that predetermined Hour
In effect the wicked, given to sin, are embodied with bewildered souls and unsound minds
There shall come the Day when they are dragged on their faces and be told: " Now, feel the unbearable sensation coming over your bodies by being cast into Hell fire
Nothing do We create casually; but everything, spiritual, animate and inanimate We create according to plan indicating the relations of objects to one another, times and places of intended doings and actions, proportions and measures, disposition of parts, designs, arrangements, limitations and consequence, all in one single act
Thus, Our command to bring into being anything, spiritual animate or inanimate, or to bring into effect any proceedings is but a single act executed instantaneously, like the twinkle of an eye
So, pause you people to think of what We did to your ancestors and to people of your sort who denied their Messengers and treated them as one who passes himself off as someone other than he is; and so, is there any who will open his heart's ears and his mind's eyes
And you ought to know that every act, worthy or worthless, good or evil, in the very doing or the point of doing, is set down in writing in the book of Records which the guardian angels keep
Also every act, trivial and insignificant or significant and expressive of something, is related in writing and put on record
Those who regard Allah with breasts filled with piety and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, shall be welcomed into gardens beneath which rivers flow
Gardens in the beatitude of heavens realm, in the presence of Allah wherein they enjoy the conviviality and Divine liberality and good will of A Malikin (Sovereign) Who is Moqtadir (Omnipresent), Omniscient and Omnipotent
Al Rahman
Who taught man the Quran, and by its instrumentality has He imparted to him knowledge and wisdom
He created man and brought him into being
And He taught him the expression of his thoughts in words and intellectual acquaintance with, and perception of, fact and truth and good versus evil
The courses of the sun and the moon were determined according to precise computation
And the stars and all that is in the heaven and the trees and all that is on earth bow to Him in adoration and prostrate their reason to Divine Omnipotence
And the heaven did He raise aloft and construct as a building of imposing elevation, and He set the balance of reason, justice and vindication
So that you do not go beyond the limits prescribed whether in balancing probabilities to determine the truth or in balancing scales, nor go beyond all prudence and discretion
But counterpoise and hold in equipoise all matters, concerns and affairs and that which exists individually, in fact or in idea, and that which is or may be in anyway an object of perception, knowledge, or thought, and do not de induced to act dishonestly with the balance, thus remains everything in the course and order wherein it was set at the creation
And the earth did He found on a secure basis for created beings, animate and inanimate, and furnish with all that ministers to man's comfort and induces appreciation
Therein grow edible variegated and delicious fruits and date- palms with large bracts and sheathing leaves enveloping the inflorescence which later becomes the fruit as the dates will come to be
And grain of varying fruit- plants and grasses, with its clothing of the rich green leaves and the fragrance of its blossom
Therefore, which of your Creator's favours, you people of mankind and the Jinn, will deny
He created man's material part from clay, the same material of which earthenware vessels are made of
And He created the Jinn from a brilliant flame of fire
Therefore, which of your Creator's blessing's, you people of mankind and the Jinn, will deny
It is He, Who ordained the two major cardinal eastern points and the two major western cardinal points and the points in between, where the sun rises and sets in winter and summer respectively, passing through recurrent cycles of successive events
Therefore, which of your Creator's favours, you people of mankind and the Jinn, will deny

When the horrendous Eventful Event comes to pass
It shall come into everyone's head and no expedient whatever will avert it nor can it be denied
It shall abase those whose mode of action incurred the destiny they brought upon themselves of coming down very low, and it shall raise and exalt in dignity those whose breasts had been filled with the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
The earth shakes violently with earthquakes, volcanoes and convulsions
And the mountains shiver into atoms
And become so comminuted as to be raised in a cloud by the wind and scattered like ashes
There and then, you people shall fall into one of three orders, each occupying the position accorded with his merit
A position on the right side which of right belongs to those who had dearly earned the position on the right; their works agreed with the Divine standard of actions and conduct and their hearts had been impressed with the image of piety. These, has Allah destined to win their way to paradise
A position on the left side which of right belongs to those who had eagerly earned their position on the left. Among them are those who denied Allah and the hypocrites who assumed a false appearance of virtue and goodness with dissimulation of real character and inclinations and also those who counselled deaf to Allah's ordinances. These had Allah destined to hell where they make abode
And above all, a position, that is foremost, which of right belongs to those who were gifted with the Divine prerogative of prophethood and apostleship and also to those who before all others had surrendered to Allah's authority and preceded all others in applying their hearts to wisdom and piety with breasts filled with reverential awe and Allah's purpose was the heart of their purpose
These are the nearest to Allah's special blessedness and they stand really high in His favour
They shall be welcomed by Him into gardens of surpassing beauty in the beatitude of heaven, the haven of all bliss
These favorites include a greater number of those who preceded
and a lesser number of those who succeeded
They will be seated on thrones studded with gold and adorned with pearls
They recline thereon facing each other
They will be served by handsome attendants whose figures, in conjunction with stateliness, and their beauty in conjunction with dignity are eternal
Attendants who go round carrying large mouthed deep vessels and goblets to serve a drink issuing from a jet streaming from the springs of heaven
A drink which gives a rapturous feeling of bliss and beatitude and causes no headache nor does it intoxicate the brain
And they will be served with the fruits of their choice
And with the flesh of the fowls which they desire
They will be accompanied by beauties whose eyes radiate splendour that no one could have conceived
Beauties representing as like precious pearles gracefully adorned as with blazonry affording keen pleasure to the sense of sight, and charming the intellectual and moral faculties
This is the reward for their meritorious actions and for their works which reflected wisdom and piety
No matter of little value or insignificance will they hear therein, nor will they hear ill tongues or what is morally evil
But only " Peace, peace be upon you " a greeting addressed by the angels who express good will
And those, who have dearly earned the position on the right, whose works and the Divine standard together accorded
Shall inherit eternal life in an environment affording pleasure: landscape portraying thorn- free trees of exquisite beauty inspiring dreamy and luxurious ease
Trees bearing most variegated flowers and trees bearing delicious fruits inducing them to taste the pleasures of eternal life
Trees casting a delightful shadow spreading out and extending in all directions inspiring delight in the sweet aires of heaven and the symphonies of colour
A picturesque view of fountain-heads from which water streams gracefully, reflecting the glory of heaven's realm
Fruits, plentiful and delicious
Never will it be scarce nor will it be forbidden
Furnishings like thrones apt to the furniture of pious personage and raised aloft to exalt them in dignity
And companions whom We created anew
We made them virgins, a symbol of purity, and maidens in a state of inviolate chastity
Distinguished for piety and for a pleasing voice concerted in harmonious music as sweet as the strings of nature's symphony
We have prepared them for those disposed on the right
Who include a great number of those who preceded
And also a great number of those who succeeded
As for those who had deservedly earned the disposition on the left, who challenged Allah and His Messenger, and deviated from the path of righteousness
They shall be exposed to a very strong and lasting hot blast and their thirst will make the boiling water inviting, but never will it quench their thirst
They shall be cast into the shade of the densly overwhelming black smoke
Which is neither refreshing nor pleasing
Lawless and passionate was their desire for lust and luxury
How obstinate they were in adhering to their own evil course of denying Allah
They always maintained their false dictum that: " How can we be raised after death when we have been reduced to dust and bones
And what about our forefathers; are they also included
Say to them O Muhammad " The foremost and the utmost
Shall all be gathered at a certain time on a predestined Day which shall neither be postdated nor anticipated
And then you perverts, deniers of all truth
You shall be fed on the fruit of the evil tree named zaqqum
And you shall eat thereof your full
Then boiling water, over and above
The sensation of thirst shall force you to drink more but like unhealthy camels, you shall be always thirsty
And so here, and from now on, they make abode
We created you and brought you into being from a state of nothingness and gave you form and shape, and so why will you not believe in Resurrection
Do you see the fluid you emit
Do you create it with the seeds it contains or are We the Creator
We determined death to fall to you as your common lot and We are not incapable of bringing it to effect
Nor are We incapable of exchanging your present form and shape into another form and shape unknown to you, on the Day We resurrect you
And you have already known the first form of creation, so why will you not ponder
Do you see the seeds you deposit in the earth so that they may grow
Do you make them grow or is it We Who make them grow
Had We willed We could reduce them to crumbs and would leave you wonder
But it is We on whom the burden is laid
And yet We make no gain or profit
Do you see the water you drink
Do you bring it down from the clouds floating at various heights in the upper air or do We
Had We willed We could render it salty and embitter all the sweets of life so why are you not impelled to the feeling of gratitude
Do you see the fire you kindle
Was it you who generated its tree or is it We that brought it into existence
We made it a reminder for Our Omnipotence here and Hereafter, and a material advantage and a commodity for those who make use among Our creation
And so, praise the attributes and advance the glory of the Name of Allah your Creator, Who conducts and advances your growth and inspires you with actuation
I swear by the location of the stars; -see introduction
And it is an asseveration of immense magnitude if only you knew
That: the wording revealed to Our Messenger is but a distinguished Book, worthy of honour and entitled to respect, esteem and reverence
A Quran derived from a source- Book- well guarded in the heaven's realm
A Quran that is not to be touched or taken in the hands which are not free from dirt or filth or not free from ceremonial or sanitary defilement, nor in the hands of anyone who has had sexual congress until he or she has bathed
For it is a Revelation of knowledge to man by his Creator the Divine Creator of the worlds, past, present and those to come
Is it not a pity that you people declare such a Revelation to be untrue
And you prosper by refusing to acknowledge it and by refusing to admit it as authentic and authoritatively true
So, what about the moment of the encounter with death when the soul is on its way out and it makes a rattle in the throat
And you are then on the watch for what is expected, but unable to avert the inevitable
There and then We are in his or her immediate proximity and far closer to the dying than you can possibly perceive or imagine, but you cannot see
And so, if, as is the case, you deny you're Creator and you deny Resurrection and the Day of Reckoning
Why then are you unable to restore the soul to the dying if what you claim is true
If he or she is one of those nearest to Allah s special blessedness and he or she stands high in His favour
Then a great welcome and a rich smell of sweet air, fragrance and the beatitude of heaven
And if he or she is among those who had dearly earned the disposition on the right
Then a greeting of " Peace be upon you " shall be addressed by the angels who express good will
But if he or she be among those who denied the truth and strayed from the path of righteousness
Then in the boiling pot shall he or she make abode
And he or she shall go down in Hell to the pit
This is but the true picture of the destiny awaiting such persons and the truth which admits of no relaxation
Therefore, O man, you should praise the diving attributes and advance the glory of the Name of Allah your Creator who conducts and advances your growth and inspires you with actuation
Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes", is an act of worship ascribed by all beings in the heavens, the spiritual, the animate and the inanimate on earth, and He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim ( the Wise)
To Him belongs the absolute sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; He gives life and inspirits the property of animate existence and He occasions death and deprives of animate existence
He is the First and the Foremost, He is the Last and the Utmost, He is infinite, He is beyond and above all, yet exposed to the mental view and accessible to appeals, and He is beyond and below all to give support to all in all; His marvels are inherent in the whole and He is the Omnipresent Who holds prescience of all events, He is the ultimate goal and He is AL-Alim (the Omniscient) who knows all
He is it Who created the heavens and the earth in six days* determined by His own unit of time and proclaimed in His calendar, then set He Himself on the throne of supremacy and dominion and of grace and mercy. He has omniscience of all that makes. entry and penetrates into the earth, be it animate or inanimate, and of ail that arises from it and what erupts from within and the water streaming out of it. And He has omniscience of all that comes down from the realm of heaven and from the vault of its floor, and of all that ascends of deeds and of the souls of those who have done the deeds, and of the spiritual and the animate and all that is inanimate. He is Omnipresent; He is in presence with you wherever you are and He is Bassirun of all that you do,(whether by day or by night, exposed or hidden, indoors or out, on land or at sea and wherever you may be)
To Him belongs the absolute sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and to Him, the ultimate Authority, are committed and submitted all matters and all affairs for consideration, decision and execution here and Hereafter
He causes the night** to lose its character and identity by absorption into the day and He causes the day** to lose its character and identity by absorption into the night irrespective of the nature of the day, solar, civil, or sidereal, or the period of the year. And He is well acquainted with what the breasts forge that the tongues must vent, and with what the breasts hide in store for future conditions and events
Be strongly disposed to open your heart's ears and your mind's eyes to give credence and mental acceptance to reasoning which will lead you, in satisfaction, to urge your belief in Allah and His Messenger, and spend in benevolence of what He put you in possession of. Those of you who believed in Allah after they have reasoned at every step they trod and spend in benevolence shall merit a great reward
And why would you not open your hearts' ears and your minds' eyes and reason to urge your belief in Allah while the Messenger furnishes you with the instruments of thought conductive to meditation to contemplate the belief in your Creator and your vows were pledged to Him as men of Faith
It is He who reveals to His servant -the Messenger- revelations clear and plain to guide you - people - out of darkness and superstitions of later times, and out of want of spiritual and intellectual sight into illumination and enlightenment, so that the spirit of truth guides you into all truth, and Allah to you is indeed Raufun (kind) and Rahimun (Merciful)
And why should you not spend in the cause of Allah and you recoil back as though you fear you may be reduced to penury when you know that Allah is He who has the Absolute rightful claim to the heavens and the earth and the only heir to the heavens and the earth. Those of you who spent and strove in the cause of Allah before the conquest of Macca where the faithful were few and conditions unfavourable, are not like those who spent thereafter when the gates of Faith opened and most people came in Those who spent before the conquest are a step higher in the scale of dignity, rank and reward than those who spent thereafter, But both has Allah promised good will and efficacious grace, and Allah is Khabirun (well acquainted with all that you do)
Who would like to lend Allah: all he can of benevolence and of pious deeds toward his future security and Allah shall reimburse him many times the like and entitle him to a meritorious reward
One day, you shall see those whose hearts - reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues among the men and the women disposed to merriment, their faces glowing with light emanating from Allah's countenance and proceeding ahead of them. It illuminates the way for them when they contemplate the most difficult and inevitable crossing; carrying their books bearing their records in their right hands. There and then they will be complimented upon their happy event of winning their way to paradise beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, and how befitting and how exulting is the triumph
This is the Day when the hypocrites, among the men and the women, will say to those whose hearts reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues: "Would you look back in our direction, so that we avail ourselves of your light". But they will be told: "Go back to where we were granted light and pray for it" only to find themselves separated from those who are blessed and shut out behind a barrier emitting mercy to those within and torment to those without
Then they -the hypocrites- call out to those who are blessed and say to them: "Had we not been together Here and Hereafter and together we attended assemblies of prayers and pilgrimage and together we fought". Indeed we were together, say the virtuous "but you counseled deaf and you closed your hearts' ears and your minds' eyes and did not keep back from the forbidden. You were illuded with the false hopes that gratifying your appetite was something instinctively felt to be right and fair, and with Satanic deceit you had forgotten calling Allah to mind
And so now, and on this Day, no atonement can be accepted neither from you -hypocrites- nor from those who denied Allah to ransom your ill deeds even if it be as much gold as there is on earth". "Hell is the place where you make abode; and how evil is the destination
Is it not time that those who have conformed to Islam open their hearts' ears so that their breasts be filled with reverential awe as they listen to the Quran and accord with what it says and with the truth it declares. They should not be like those who have been given the Book before them who have transmuted the Book to their purpose throughout the years and became hard hearted? Indeed many among them are wicked
You must know that Allah revivifies* the earth after it has suffered death; We have expounded for you -people- Our revelations and meritoriously elucidated them that you may hopefully apprehend the voice from heaven and express as much joy as your hearts may comprehend
The benevolent, among the men and the women, who have lent Allah all they could of benevolence and pious deeds toward future security will be reimbursed with many times the like and will be entitled to a meritorious reward
And those whose breasts have been filled with reverential. awe and their hearts with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds with wisdom and piety on the ground of their sincere belief in Allah and His Messenger and the promotion Of their purpose, are they who are titled with the dignified rank of the "pure", the "veracious". Then come the pious who carried the banners of truth at odds and have acquired the glorious privilege of "Martyrs" through resisting to blood with their spiritual armour. Both of them are they who have been destined to enjoy such designations in the heavens realm There await them a meritorious reward and light emanating from Allah's countenance to glow in their faces and proceed ahead of them But those who denied Allah and refused to recognize His revelations are those who shall make their abode in hell
You -people- had better know that life here is hut an illusive and rapid change of feeling, fancy and thought and an amusement and a display of splendour, boastfulness and vainglory and treasuring of wealth and multiplication in progeny; all but regressing naturally to nothingness, like man who goes from childhood to youthfulness to maturity, then to wrinkles characteristic of age, then to weakness and infirmity, then he goes through the gates of death. A succession of events similar to a land that has been tilled and cultivated by those who care only for the material harvest and counsel deaf to spiritual harvest. Then it rained, and the crops grew delightfully well and to their hearts desire. Then suddenly the crops lost their bloom and natural colour, turned yellow then dried up, shriveled and decayed. Likewise, in the Hereafter there is a condign punishment, but also forgiveness and fulfillment of desire; and life here is but an animate existence affording pleasure deceiving those with foolish credulous ambition and vain employment of time
Vie with one another and compete to win Allah's forgiveness and your way to the beatitude of heaven in a paradise as wide as the heaven and the earth; prepared for those who sincerely believed in Allah and His Messenger. This is the sufficient and efficacious grace of Allah; He confers it on whom He will, and Allah is the Source of all grace
No misfortune or calamity takes place on earth or weds you personally but has been predestined and committed to writing in a Book long before We make it come to pass, an act that presents itself to Allah, and how easy it is to bring it to effect
So that you people apprehend that what has befallen you would never have missed you, nor what failed to hit you was meant to aim at you; and so do not nurse despair nor grieve at heart for what you failed to attain, nor boast your wit and exult over the favours you were made to wear, for Allah detests every boastful who exalts himself unduly and displays inordinate self-esteens
Those who are miserly, unwilling to give in benevolence or spend in divine service, and induce others to be mean and parsimonious, have in effect permitted the forbidden and commended it to others. And he who counsels deaf to the ordinances of Allah must realize that Allah is AL-Ghaniy (independent, Absolute) and AL-Hamid (Worthy of all praise)
We have previously and thus early sent Our Messengers with expounded revelations and elucidated signs and accorded them Books and authority to administer wisdom and induce the war of justice against injustice, so that people learn the conformity to the truth and the justness of perception to deal with facts and deny falsehood. And We provided the earth with iron to attain a purpose, as will as power and strength in war against tyranny and falsehood' and to be of service in effecting one's object to do what is needed in life. Allah shall know who among the men do intend to direct their minds and their thoughts to striving in His cause and to the support of His Messenger to attain Allah's purpose; Allah is indeed Qawiyun (Omnipotent) and Azizun
We did send Nuh and Ibrahim and We kept the Divine prerogative of prophethood and the Book in their line, Among their descendants were those who opened their hearts' ears and their minds' eyes, but also those who counselled deaf and were disposed to wickedness, and they were many
Then in sequence We sent after them others of Our Messengers from the same lineal descent and in order of succession We sent Isa (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), and We gave him the Injil (the Bible) and We impressed the hearts of those who followed him and believed in him with kindness and mercy and monasticism, a system of their contrivance they had introduced, We never imposed on them. They were expected to please Allah with the profound reverence dutiful to Him and with deeds reflecting wisdom and piety and striving in His cause to attain His purpose. Yet when We made Monasticism come to pass, they never regarded the principle with close attention nor did they foster it as they should. And so We gave those of them, whose hearts Reflected the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety the reward they merited; many among them were indeed wicked
O you whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand, regard Allah with breasts filled with reverential awe, and have regard for His Messenger and heed his influence and authority on your conduct and your actions, Allah extends to you an act of His mercy and puts two in place of one; He imparts to you spiritual light guiding you to the path of righteousness and leading you out of darkness and want of intellectual sight into enlightenment and Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
So that Ahl AL-Kitab (people of the Book) would realize that they cannot force Allah's hands to confer on them His grace or a free and unmerited favour and that grace, be it sufficient or efficacious, rests with Allah; He confers it on whom He will, and Allah is the source of abounding munificence and all grace
Allah has heard the allegation of the woman who has reported her husband to you as having wronged her, and urges a prayer appealing to Allah for mercy. Allah hears the series of statements by both of you intended to establish an edict. Allah is Sami'un and Bassirun (hears and sees all in all)
Those of you who use the diction "mother's back" as a symbol of the Forbidden in their formula for dissolving their marriages must know that their wives are not their mothers; their mothers are those who gave birth to them; they express what is indeed profane and utter falsehood, but Allah is 'Afuwun (Clement) and Ghafurun (Forgiving) of all in all
And those of you who have used this diction of " mother's back " in dissolving their marriages and now wish to take back their statements and resume their marriage ties, incur the liability. of freeing a slave before touching' their wives. This is a reproach against you to warn you of such an act, and Allah is well acquainted with your conditions and with all that you do
And he, who does not have the means to do so, will have to fast by way a penitence for two successive months (dawn to sunset) before touching his wife, and if he is unable to fast, he may feed sixty indigent persons with desire and intention of amendment and repentance; this is to make you believe in Allah and His Messenger with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. These are the limitations imposed by Allah; and those who deny Him shall be destined to suffer a condign punishment
Those who challenge Allah and His Messenger are' cursed; they are beset by sin and covered with ignominy as were the like before them. We have revealed expounded revelations and lucid signs serving as evidence and ground for belief; and there awaits those who denied Allah a condign punishment
One day shall He resurrect them all, and inform them of all that they had done bringing the charge against them and imputing their evil. Allah has computed it all and they have forgotten it all. Their evil deeds will be the witnesses of their worth and their faces will bear witness to their behavior but Allah is Shahidun (witness of all things in all respects)
Do you not see that Allah is fully cognizant of all in all that are in the heaven and of all things in all respects that are on earth There is not an instance where three convey their thoughts reciprocally in talk, be it under their breath or openly disclosed but He makes their fourth, nor among five but He makes their sixth, nor numerically less or numerically more but He is in their presence; Allah is Alimun (Omniscient)
Do you see O Muhammad how those who were forbidden secret counsels turn their minds back to what they have been forbidden to do? They convey their thoughts reciprocally in talk uttered below their breath, reticent about their intentions of secretly promoting the evil forged in their bosoms that their tongues must vent. They encourage aggression upon others and disobedience to the Messenger. When they come to you they greet you with expressions of ill-will unlike that with which Allah greets you, and they suggest secretly to their minds: "if he is truly a Messenger of Allah would Allah not punish us on his behalf?" Hell awaits them to be put to the torture, and how evil is the destination
O you whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand: if you secretly counsel with each other and you are reticent about your intentions, do not entertain the thoughts of evil and aggression nor of disobedience to the Messenger, but let your principles and your practice together accord. Your purpose should be the promotion of piety and habitual reverence and obedience to Allah and faithfulness to the duties naturally owed to Him, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah since to Him you shall be thronged
Secret suggestions to the mind and conveyance of thoughts reciprocally in talk under your breath may be inspired by AL-Shaytan (Satan) to hurt those believers whose hearts have been impressed with the image of piety. But never can he hurt them without Allah's leave, and in Allah should the pious, who are careful of the duties owed to Him, place reliance and in him they should trust
O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: when you are in an assembly and you are requested to move a little to make room for a new comer, do move and spread out; Allah widens your scope and the good may become best. And when you are asked to rise, do rise; Allah will raise those whose hearts have been impressed with the image of piety, as well as those men of learning and profitable knowledge, to higher ranks and exalt them in dignity and power. Allah is well acquainted with all that you do
O you whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand: when you wish to take counsel with the Messenger, let the occasion be preceded by an act of charity; this is commendable in you and fits you so purified to receive Allah's blessings but if you do not have the means; Allah is Ghafurun and Rahimun
How is it that back you recoiled, afraid of the acts of charity incumbent: on you before you took counsel with the Messenger! So you stopped taking private counsel, and Allah relented and quit you all His debt. But then, you must observe your prayers and give the alms and obey Allah and His Messenger; Allah is well acquainted with all that you do
Do you see how these hypocrites made a friendly intimacy with a people who incurred the righteous indignation of Allah. They neither really belong to you nor to them and they take an oath profanely and they know they are lying
Allah has prepared for them a condign punishment, evil indeed is what their minds habituated them to do
They used their oaths to hide, under the garb of truth, their extreme vanity and evil deeds, and many among the believers were deceived, and so their policy achieved its necessary ends. Consequently they have blocked the path of Allah, the path of righteousness and persistently opposed the progress in purpose and in action. There awaits them a humiliating and condign punishment
Neither their wealth nor their progeny will profit them, or afford them help or be beneficially effective against what Allah has for them in store; these are the inmates of Hell, wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering
One day shall He resurrect them all, then they will appeal to Him swearing, just as they swore to you with an appeal to Allah in confirmation of what they said and they think there is something in it, while indeed they are liars
AL-Shaytan got the better of them and made them fail to recall Allah to mind. These are members of the Satanic party united in maintaining an evil cause and defiant impiety. Indeed the partisans of AL-Shaytan shall incur privation and shall suffer loss
Those who challenge Allah and His Messenger and oppose the word of Allah and maintain their position as antagonists and adversaries, shall be incensed by multiplied wrongs and humiliations
An ordinance set by Allah and a dictum He pronounced authoritatively: " I- Allah-along with My Messengers shall be emblematic of the final victory of all truth". Great is truth and it shall prevail; Allah is Qawiyun (Omnipotent) and Azizun
You shall not find a people, true and solemn believers, with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety and minds conscious of the Last Day, who would have intimate friendship with those who challenge Allah and His Messenger, albeit they be their fathers or sons, their brothers or relatives. These are people whose hearts has Allah inscribed with the justification of Faith as a conviction operative on their character and will; He has given them moral support, courage and just confidence. He shall welcome them to His heaven's realm and admit them into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, and in the beatitude of heaven they shall experience that vast forever. Allah has been pleased with them and they with Him. These are members of the Divine party; and who would heaven prosper better than the partisans of this party who are zealous supporters of the cause of Allah which is the heart of His purpose
Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes ", is an act of worship ascribed by all beings that are in the heavens, and all beings, spiritual, animate and inanimate that are on earth, and He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
It is He Who drove those who denied Him among Ahl AL-Kitab (the People of the Book) out of their homes at the beginning of the thronging for the battle. You yourselves, O Muslims, did not think they would go out of their fortresses nor did they themselves think that their fortresses were penetrable to any hostile action, not to mention that contemptible notion of being proof against Allah. But Allah reduced them to impotence in His own manner which they never expected and He inspired terror in their hearts so that as they had tried to ruin the whole tower of Faith, they perfected their own ruin. They demolished their own homes and reduced their own property into a useless from by their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed you people of sight and can lift to Allah their inward sight
Had it not been that Allah had ordained their expulsion and the expurgation and cleansing of Madina of them, He would have afflicted them with a condign punishment; and there is yet their torment in the Fire Hereafter
This train of events succeeding one another were occasioned on account of their disobedience to Allah and His Messenger; and he who disobeys Allah shall realize that He punishes severely
No tree, palm tree or any tree, you Muslims uproot or you leave standing on its root, but is in accordance with Allah's leave so that He brings disgrace upon those who are wicked
And what Allah has bestowed on His Messenger of the resources gained from the enemy, you Muslims did not win through war by your mounted troops or by swordsmen, hut Allah incites His Messenger against whom He will, and Allah is Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things
Therefore, all that Allah has bestowed on His Messenger of the resources gained from the villages' inhabitants under such circumstances belongs to Allah and to the Messenger, to the kindred and the orphans, and to the indigent and the wayfarer who, due to lack of means, travels on foot. This is to prevent such gains from passing into the hands of the wealthy among you. And whatever the Messenger commands you to do, you must do, and whatever he forbids you to do, you do not do,and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; He punishes severely
The indigent who merit such gains are those emigrants who were expelled and ousted of their homes and lost their wealth in the cause of Allah in quest of His efficacious grace and His good will. They afforded His Messenger all the help they could give and strove to satisfy Allah's purpose with no provisions other than reverential awe under the umbrella of His grace
Next are those who emigrated and settled earlier, justifying Faith as a conviction operative on their character and will, who love to see and welcome their successors and afford them refuge with clean breasts not begrudging their aid, abnegating themselves of what they themselves may need in favour of the others. And he who opposes the incitement arising from the state of mind and feeling and guards himself against an unjust act, impiety, iniquity, greed, niggardliness, immorality and such vices, shall heaven prosper him and such persons
Next come those who succeeded last with pure hearts and minds, who suggest to their minds and declare in words: " Our Creator, forgive us our iniquities and the iniquities of those who took precedence of us in conforming to the faith and do not implant in our hearts ill-will toward those whose heart's ears were open to faith; our Creator You are Raufun (exercising pity), and Rahimun (Merciful)
Did you not ponder -O Muhammad- how the hypocrites promised aid to their fellows-in-disbelief among Ahl AL-Kitab and how they disappointed their expectations? They said to them: "If you are expelled and ousted of your homes we will go with you, find never will we be influenced by anyone to fight against you and if you are attacked we will come to your aid". And Allah knows they are liars
Should they -the Jewish tribe- be driven out, never shall they go with them, and if they should be attacked, never shall they come to their aid, and if they come to their aid they shall be the first to flee and never shall they be helped
Their hearts are impressed with the image of fear; they fear you Muslims far more than they fear. Allah, and this is on account of their dullness of comprehension
They will not fight you in all, except in fortified villages strengthened against attack, or from behind walls in a position of defense when they are besieged. They are badly disposed to enmity at each other. You think they are unity personified while in effect their hearts are totally diversified. This is on account of their lack of sound judgement in the choice of means and ends
They are like those Pagans of Quraish, who tasted the fatal consequences of the evil way they conducted themselves in life not long ago at the battle of Badr, and there is yet an unsparing penalty and condign punishment
In a like manner did AL-Shaytan (Satan) incite man to deny Allah, and when man did deny Allah and was confronted with the fatal consequences, there came AL-Shaytan in apparition and said to him: "I am innocent of your ills and I fear Allah, Creator of the worlds
In the end they were both condemned in as much as they were worth, and in Hell they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering, for this is the retribution appropriate to those who do wrong
O you whose hearts reflect the Image of religious and spiritual virtues: entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah; every soul should call to memory and ponder what it has advanced of pious deeds toward future security, and regard Allah with breasts filled with reverential awe. Allah is well acquainted with all that you do
And do not be like those who fail to recall Allah to mind; consequently Allah makes them forget to do what is good for themselves and neglect to purchase themselves a good opinion. Such persons are the wicked
Never will the inmates of Hell compare to those in the beatitude of heaven. Those beheld in bliss are the blessed who have won the victory
Had We revealed this Quran to a mountain and it could perceive the picture of what it represents and the complete glory in which it reveals itself, you would see it shaking with such fits of awe and shivering into atoms for the profound reverence dutiful to Allah. Such parables do We discourse to people that they may hopefully ponder, and that they may hopefully think and reflect before they act
He is Allah, the only llah there is, Alimun (the Omniscient) of the invisible, the hidden and the unseen, and of what the bosoms store of thoughts and feelings and of what the bosoms forge. He has cognizance and holds prescience of what you converse secretly and utter below your breath and of what is suggested secretly to the mind. He is well acquainted with the visible and the seen and with what is avowed openly and openly disclosed, and with what is uttered loudly and with all that is being said, AL-Rahman, and AL-Rahim (the Merciful)
He is Allah the only llah there is, AL-Malik (the Sovereign), AL-Qudus (Perfection personified), AL-Salam (the Emblem of peace), AL Mu-min (the Source and Trustee of Faith), AL-Muhaymin (the Paramount Ruler of the Universe), AL- Aziz (the Almighty), AL-Gabbar (the Omnipotent), and AL-Motakbber (the Highest Authority). Supreme as He is, He is far above those they incorporate with Him
He is Allah, the Creator, the Originator Who fashions the fertilized ovule- plant and animal-in the place or point of origin and growth, Who instantaneously designs, makes, forms, shapes, produces and brings into being, Who fashions the countenance and visible form characteristic of every being and constructs the frame of the animate and inanimate, the material and the immaterial. To Him belong all the Unique Attributes. All beings in the heaven and on earth praise His glory and extoll His glorious attributes; He is AL-Aziz and AL-Hakim
O you. whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: do not make a friendly intimacy with My enemy and yours who are disposed to strive against Allah and His cause and against the Messenger and his Faith. You regard them with tenderness when they have denied Allah and denied the truth you have received. They drove the Messenger along with you out of their midst, and ousted you of your privileges, for no reason other than the war of disbelief against belief in Allah, your Creator. If indeed you have gone to war to strive in My cause and to serve and satisfy My purpose, then how could you make a friendly intimacy with My enemies and regard them with tenderness! I know well what your breasts store of thoughts and feelings and what your breasts forge, I know what you converse secretly and utter below your breath, and what you suggest secretly to the mind. I also know what you avow openly and openly disclose, and what you utter loudly, and all that is being said. Therefore, he, who amongst you attempts to do this, will have wronged himself and wandered from the path of righteousness.". .. Seen the hungry ocean gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore". Shakespeare
Had they been in a position to get the better of you, they would not have hesitated to gain advantage on you and declare their enmity by the valour of their hands and by scorning at you and by casting all the contempts they could cast. They would call you everything they can lay their tongues to, and they wish you would desert Faith in favour of disbelief
Neither your uterine relatives, or those related by consanguinity, nor your progeny, can profit you or afford you help in Day of Judgement if Allah has meant that ill shall befall you. Allah judges between you and them, and Allah is well acquainted with all that you do
But you people have had in Ibrahim and his followers a good example and a distinguished quality of action and conduct that induces imitation. They said to their people: "we are certainly innocent of your ills and of your false gods you worship besides Allah". "We refuse to recognize you or submit to you, and enmity and hatred between us shall forever prevail until you have abandoned idolatry and submitted to the authority of Allah and until you have sincerely believed in Him alone with works imprinted with wisdom and piety". Therefore do not confuse the issue and fail to distinguish between invoking Allah's forgiveness on behalf of your dead, and the supplication made by Ibrahim on behalf of his father. Ibrahim had promised his father, earlier, he would invoke on his behalf Allah's forgiveness albeit he could not guarantee the outcome. But when he realized that his father remained a faithful adherent to Paganism, he at once rejected him and declared his innocence of his fatherhood. And when Ibrahim and his followers resolved to quit their people and their homeland they prayed: "Our Creator, in You we trust, and we repent the disagreeable time we spent with our people, and we repent what we might have done or left undone, and You are the end and the purpose for which we are destined
Our Creator: do not afflict us with suffering from your heaven's realm, nor at the hands of our wicked people lest they should think we were in the wrong and they in the right, and forgive us our iniquities our Creator, You are AL- Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
Indeed you people had in them -Ibrahim and his followers- the good example and the distinguished quality of action and conduct that induce imitation by those whose object of effort and ambition and their end and purpose are Allah and the Day of Judgement. And those who turn a deaf ear must realize that Allah is AL-Ghaniy (Independent, Absolute) and AL-Hamid (Worthy of all praise)
Perhaps Allah may take the matters of fact and circumstance them after His own manner and convert ill-will, between you and those with whom you were at enmity, into affection, He is Qadirun (Omnipotent), and Allah is Ghafurun (Forgiving), and Rahimun (Merciful)
Allah did not interdict your considerateness in intercourse with those who did not wage war against your religion nor did they drive you out and oust you of your homes. To the contrary, He expects you to be courteous to them and to treat them with tenderness and equity and to help the needy among them and those who are weak; Allah likes those who are courteous and crowned with equity
But He prohibits you from making a friendly intimacy with those who waged war against your religion and drove you out and ousted you of your homes, and supported others in effecting your ejection. and he who makes with them a friendly intimacy then. such persons are wrong-doers
O you whose hearts reflect he image of religious and spiritual virtues: If women come to you emigrating or seeking refuge owing to religious persecution or political troubles, test their beliefs; Allah knows well if the image of Faith has been imprinted upon their hearts. if you are satisfied that they believe in Allah with bosoms filled with reverential awe, do not send them back to the Pagans. They -the women are no longer legitimate to them nor are they -the Pagan men- any longer legitimate to them. But you must pay their -Pagan- husbands the equivalent of what they had spent on them in the way of dowry. You are absolved to marry these women if you pay them their dower and do not marry the Pagan women nor remain with them if you have conformed to Islam and they have not, but you may ask for what you spent and so can Pagan men ask for what they spent. This is the ordinance of Allah; He judges between you, and He is Alimun (Omniscient), and Hakimun (Wise)
And if a believer's wife deserts him and goes back the Pagans who will not compensate him for what he spent, then when circumstances occasion the reverse, you may pay them an equivalent penalty, and the Muslim husband is to be compensated from the spoils of war; and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah Who has impressed upon your hearts the image of piety
O you the Prophet: If emigrating women who conformed to Islam come to you and pledge before Allah their vows to you that: they will not incorporate with Allah other deities, they will not steal, nor will they commit adultry nor infanticide, they will not speak or utter slanders nor relate falsehood, they will not conceive an illegitimate child and make the husband believe it is his, nor will they disobey you in matters crowned with equity; then you accept their pledge and invoke on their behalf Allah's forgiveness, for He is indeed Ghafurun and Rahimun
O you whose hearts - reflect - the image of religious and spiritual virtues: do not make friendly intimacy with people who have come within the measure of Allah's wrath. They have given up hope of sharing the beatitude of the Hereafter, just as they have lost hope of their dead returning back from their graves, and just as their dead had already despaired of forgiveness
Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes " is an act of, worship ascribed by all beings that are in the heavens and all beings spiritual, animate and inanimate that are on earth and He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty), and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
O you Whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: why do you say and state in words, or resolve to act, or promise to do, what you do not do or duly perform
It is utterly distasteful to Allah and objectionable to Him indeed that your actions with your words do not accord
Allah likes those who fight in His cause to be wedged together like bricks in the closest and most defensible array
For once, Mussa said to his people: " My people: Why do you scorn me and hold me in disdain and cast at me all the contempts you could cast instead of regarding me with reverence when you know I am the Messenger of Allah who has been sent to you with a message? But when they deviated and disinclined their ears from any reverence and attention to him and counseled deaf, Allah deafened their hearts' ears Allah does not impress piety on the hearts of those who are wicked
And for once, said Isa, son of Maryam : "O Bani Isreal (Children of Isreal);" "I am the Messenger of Allah who has been sent to you to corroborate your faith in AL-Tawrah which is set before me and to confirm what it foretold of whose turn he is to come. And here I come to comfort your hearts and announce to you the joyful tidings of whose turn he is next to come, a Messenger named Ahmad". But when he -Ahmad- came confirming what Isa foretold and presented them and the Pagans with clear Divine evidence serving as a ground for belief, they said: "This is only sorcery assumed by him -by Muhammad
And who is more wicked than him who relates falsehood to Allah and incorporates with Him false gods and attributes to Him every falsity that could be devised at a time when he is graciously induced to believe in Allah the One, and Only. But Allah does not impress piety upon the hearts off the perverse who are wrongful of actions
They wish they could, with all the feeling in their minds directed toward falsifying the truth, quench the very light of Allah by word of mouth, (that is by propagating false rumours and uttering error against Him). But Allah shall continue to send His illumination -the Quran- which proceeds from Him until the souls have been lit by the divine truth and enlightenment has prevailed albeit this is hateful to those who refuse to acknowledge the truth
It is Allah Who sent His Messenger with the spirit of truth to guide people into all truth and with the Quran featuring the true religion; a Book, the criterion and the canon wherein Providence is the guide. It aligns the course of action, of thought and of life of all concerned -Muslims- and non-Muslims whose religious practices are contingent upon man-made related aspects of the one religion whose unclouded and authoritative front is Islam; albeit this is hateful to those who incorporate with Allah other deities
O you who believe with hearts reflecting the image of religious and spiritual virtues: Shall I tell you of a trade to resort to besides your trade which you practice as a means of livelihood, a trade that will help you escape a condign punishment
It is such that you believe in Allah with hearts impressed with the image ol religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety, and that you recognize His Messenger, and that you strive in His cause with your money and your lives. This is far better for you if only you know
He forgives you your iniquities and admits you to gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow and welcomes you into stately homes in the beatitude of heaven- the Gardens of Eden. This is indeed a glorious triumph
In addition, He gives you something else you regard with delight and you view with pleasure, that is, He affords you help and a victory that is quite near. Therefore, announce O Muhammad blissful tidings to those whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand and their deeds with wisdom and piety
O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: Devote yourselves to the pursuit of helping Allah's cause and His purpose until the end crowns the deed. This is consonant with what Isa had asked of his Disciples. He said to them: " Who will be my votaries in the pursuit of the cause of Allah and His purpose?" The Disciples said: " We are the votaries of Allah, addicted to striving in His cause and helping His purpose." There, did belief strike to the hearts of part of Bani Isreal and the other part counseled deaf and debased Isa and his mother. And so We upheld those who recognized him and recognized the Singleness, the Uniqueness, Sameness and of the One and only Ilah; We gave them command, dominion and authority over the others and they emerged into distinguished and distinct notice
Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes " is an act of worship avowed by all beings that are in the heavens and all beings, spiritual, animate and inanimate that are on earth; He is the Absolute AL-Malik (Sovereign) of the heavens and the earth, He is AL-Quddus (Goodness personified), AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
Allah is He Who has sent to the unlettered Arab community a Messenger from their midst to relate and to recite to them His revelations and impart sanctity to their quality and their actions. Also, to teach them the Quran and impart to them the knowledge of its Authoritative text, to teach them the wisdom of judging rightly in matters relating to life and conduct and to be in full accordance with fact, reason and good sense. He would also teach them sound judgment in the choice of means and ends; notwithstanding that they were before, ignorant adherents of evidently false beliefs
There are others elsewhere who have yet to join them and share with them heaven's mercy and grace. and Allah is Azizun and Hakimun
This is the bounty of Providence, He munificently and gracefully confers it on whom He will, and He is the source of abounding munificence and efficacious grace
The simile of those who were given AL-Tawrah to carry in their hearts and in their thoughts and it did not reach their innermost being, nor did they absorb it In their minds or profit by it, speaks of a donkey carrying a load of books full of knowledge and learning but the donkey does not understand it nor does it Profit by it. Evil is the simile of a people who have refused to admit the truth of Allah's revelations and signs, and Allah does not impress piety on the hearts of the perverse who are wrongful of actions
Say to them O Muhammad: "O you who lay claim to Judaism: if you Presume that you are the chosen people of Allah to the exclusion of all others, then appeal to Allah for the encounter with death if you are truthful
But never will they make a supplication for the fulfillment of this desire Owing to what had rested of wrong-doing earlier upon their unclean hands, And Allah is well acquainted with those who are given to wickedness
Say to them: "The death you try to flee from shall confront you and triumph over you, then you shall be conveyed back to Him Who knows the secret feelings and thoughts, the hidden from sight, the invisible and the unseen and all that is concealed. He also knows the openly avowed, the openly disclosed and all that is revealed, then shall He inform you of all that you had done
O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: when the call to the Friday prayer is proclaimed, apply yourselves to the service of Allah and present yourselves at the assembly in the mosque or place of worship and abstain from trading. This is much the better for you if only you knew
When the prayer is concluded then disperse and spread about and make it your aim to seek the bounty of Providence, and keep Allah in mind whether you buy or sell, give or take and as often as you possibly can; heaven may prosper you
And when they see merchandise purposed for trade or they See amusement- the happiness of those that cannot think - they disperse and spread about and leave you standing addressing to them the divine discourse. Say to them: "What Allah has of rewards and happiness in His heaven's realm is far better than the satisfaction and happiness you derive from trade and amusement in life. And Allah is the best Purveyor to fit every person with what is necessary and with what he needs
O you the Messenger: when the hypocrites come to you they say: " we attest that you are the Messenger of Allah" and Allah knows well that you are His Messenger, but deep down in their hearts they are insincere. Allah asserts that the hypocrites are untruthful, deceitful and their aim untrue
They use their oaths to hide, under the garb of truth, their extreme vanity Many among the believers were deceived, and the hypocrite's policy achieved its necessary ends. In consequence they have blocked the path of Allah, the path of righteousness, and persistently opposed the progress in purpose and in action. Evil indeed is the way they have conducted themselves in life
They adopted the faith and then they dropped it -Simpletons- their hearts' ears are closed and their breasts are filled with irreverence imposed upon their hearts by the evil hand
If you see them you admire their physical or material frames, their looks speak affection and their discourse speaks their presence, and when they speak they speak all cream, skimmed, and they speak sense that you cannot help but open to them your heart's ears, while in effect their words are flattering and hollow, devoid of belief, just as hollow stems of trees are devoid of life. Prompted by sense of quiet and by anxiety for their safety, they are vulnerable and susceptible to a physical force, they are susceptible to a loud cry be it uttered in approbation or denunciation. They are the avowed enemy; beware of them; Allah condemns them in as much as they are worth. How could they deviate from the path of righteousness to the path of vanity
When they -the hypocrites- are told to come back to the Messenger to invoke, on their behalf Allah's mercy and forgiveness, they turn their heads in contempt and you see them objecting with inordinate self- esteem
The conclusion of all this is one and the same viz: whether you invoke on their behalf Allah's forgiveness or you do not, Allah shall not forgive them. He does not impress piety on the hearts of the wicked
It was they who said to the people: "Wherefore do you spend money on those accompanied by Allah's Messenger -who emigrated with him to Madina- and spend yourselves in their cause?" "Put a stop," they said, "and refrain from spending on them until they have forsaken him and quitted Madina". But to Allah, be it known, belongs the rightful possession of treasuries of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites do nod comprehend this as a fact
They say: "If we should return to Madina, the one with nobility in his nature and nobility is native to him, shall displace and oust the base who is nobody
O you whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: Let not your wealth nor your progeny distract your minds and attention from remembering Allah and keeping Him in mind. He who is allured by his wealth or his progeny to neglect his duty and obligations to Allah shall he and such persons incur the privation of hope and suffer loss
And spend in benefaction and in benevolence of what We have given you, before the encounter with death occasions anyone of you and then he says "My Creator, if only you would delay my death for a while, I will seize my opportunity to be liberal in my benefactions and engage in deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety
But Allah shall not delay the death of a soul when its time is fulfilled; and Allah is well acquainted with what the bosoms store of thoughts and feelings and with all that you do
Praise be to Allah and extolled are His glorious attributes" is an act of worship by all beings in the heavens and all beings, spiritual, animate and inanimate that are on earth. To Him belongs the absolute sovereignty of the universe and to Him is the gratitude and good will; He is Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things
He is it Who created you people, and then there arose among you, into the world of action, the one who refuses to recognize Allah and the other who recognizes Allah with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues; Allah is Bassirun (Omnipresent), He sees all that you do
He created the heavens and the earth with equity and wisdom, and gave you form and shape and how shapely He fashioned you, then back to Him is the end and the purpose for which you are destined
He is Alimun (Omniscient) of all that is in the heavens and of all that is on earth, and He knows what you converse secretly or whisper under your breath and He knows what you utter loudly and all that is being said. And Allah is well acquainted with all that you suggest secretly to the mind and with all that the breasts store of thoughts and feelings and all that they forge
Have you people not been given a narrative of the eventful misfortunes which befell those who denied Allah among past generations, and how they tasted the fatal consequence of the evil way they conducted themselves in life? And there is yet an unsparing penalty and a condign punishment
These events were in the train of their response to their Messengers who brought them all the facts bearing witness to the truth and serving as a ground for belief; they made considerable efforts to bring them to themselves so that the spirit of truth would guide them into all truth. But they said: "How could it be so! shall we be steered by the guidance of mortals?" And so they refused to recognize Allah and they turned up their noses and turned a deaf ear. Allah ignored them and left them out of consideration; and Allah is Ghaiyun (Independent, Absolute) and Hamidun (Worthy of all praise)
The infidels venture to say that they shall not be resurrected. Say to them. O Muhammad: "But indeed you shall be. I solemnly swear by Allah my Creator you shall be resurrected and brought to judgment and you shall be informed of all that you had done, be it evil or good, minor or major, and this is indeed easy for Allah
You people had better believe in Allah, in His Messenger and in the Quran which We have revealed; the Quran which illuminates your minds and your souls and imparts knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light and actuates you with a feeling of reverence and awe, and Allah is Alimun of all that you do
On some future Day, the Day of Resurrection, Allah shall assemble you. This is the Day of the Throng, the righteous and the wicked thronging to judgment, and he whose heart reflects I the image of religious and spiritual virtues and his works. wisdom and piety, shall Allah forgive him his iniquities and welcome him into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow, wherein he and such persons will have passed through nature to eternity and how befitting and how exulting is the triumph
But those who refuse to recognize Allah and inherently deny the truth, and persist in labeling Our revelations and signs as falsehood, are the inmates of the Fire, wherein they will have passed through nature to eternal suffering, and how evil is the destination
No calamity befalls a soul but by the leave of Allah. He who believes in Allah with a heart impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and receives the blow without antipathy, as an act of Allah, realizing that in patience possesses he his soul, will Allah, the Spirit of truth, guide him into all truth and imprint his breast with reverential awe. Allah is Alimun of all things
You people had better obey Allah and His Messenger, and if you should turn a deaf ear and turn aside from the path of righteousness and direct your actions and thoughts away from it, then be it remembered that Our Messenger is entrusted only with relating the message and the elucidation of its text
Allah, there is no Ilah but Him; and so, entertain with profound reverence His very Oneness, Singleness, Sameness and Uniqueness, and in Him the believers, whose hearts have been touched with the Divine hand, should trust
O you whose hearts reflect : the image of religious also spiritual virtues: among your wives and your children are some who are an enemy to you, and so beware of them and be on your guard. But if you forgive, ignore their disposition and show forbearance, this will accord well together with the principles of Allah Who is Ghafurun (forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
Indeed your wealth and your progeny are but a trial for testing your inclinations and your beliefs, except that Allah in His heaven's realm has a much greater reward
Therefore, entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah to the best and open your hearts' ears to what Allah and His Messenger relate to you, and de not deviate from the path of righteousness, and spend of your wealth in benefaction and in benevolence for your own good. And he who resists the incitement arising from the state of mind and feeling and guards himself against an unjust act and impiety, inequity and greed, niggardliness and immorality and such vices, shall heaven prosper him and such persons
If you lend to Allah a pious deed, heaven shall lend you grace, and Allah reimburses you many times the like and forgives you your iniquities. Allah gives for the little what is much; He shows forbearance and may quit people His debt
He is the AL-Alim Who knows all in all; the unseen and the hidden, the spoken words, whispered under the breath or suggested secretly to the mind, and what the breasts store of thoughts and feelings and what they forge. He equally knows the loudly spoken words and all that is being said or openly done, and He is AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hakim (the wise)
O you the Prophet; instruct the believers thus; "If you should divorce women, you can only dissolve your marriage contract in accordance with the principles ordained by Allah: You must not divorce them during their courses, nor in between the courses if you have had congress with them during that space of time, nor until you have made sure whether they are pregnant or not; this gives chance for reconciliation. And pay careful attention to computing and reckoning the interval prescribed lest the divorcee, pregnant or non pregnant, should miss her chance should she wish to remarry. And regard Allah, your Creator, and entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him, and do not drive them out of their homes nor should they themselves depart there from before the conclusion of the set period unless they have committed a proven immoral act
When the set period is near fulfillment, you either hold together in honour and in each other's regard crowned with equity, or part in honour and equity. In either case you must bring two of your people, who are known to recourse to general principles of justice, who lift to Allah their inward sight, to bear witness to the final decision and resolution, be it divorce or reunion. This discourse is an exhortation to those who believe with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues, and their wisdom is consumed in confidence of the Day of Judgment. And he who entertains the profound reverence dutiful Allah, shall Allah be his very present help in trouble
He confers on him of his bounty what is to his need and convenience whence he would not perceive nor expect". "And he who puts his trust in Allah will find in Allah the answer to his purpose, his hopes and his needs". Allah's purpose achieves its necessary ends. He has apportioned to everything its rightful measure and due proportion
And those of your women who have renounced the hope of experiencing their menstrual courses again, and you are in doubt of the date or of the nature of the discharge, then they have to wait for a set period of three months. A similar set period is obligatory to those who have not yet experienced these periodic courses. As for those who are in process of gestation, their set period accords with the duration of the pregnancy and ends when they have been relieved of their burden; and he who entertains the profound reverence dutiful Allah, will Allah facilitate his task and lead him to a facile and useful life
This is the ordinance, Allah has revealed to you and enjoined; and he who entertains the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, will Allah forgive him His iniquities and aggrandize his reward
Let them live where you live or else in the equivalent thereof in accordance with your means and do not treat them contemptuously nor restrain them nor restrict them in order to force them into a course of action that is profitable to you. If they are carrying your seed in their wombs, you must support their state in life by expenditure until they are disburdened of what they carry in their wombs. If they suckle and nurse your child at the breast, then you must pay them for the service rendered, and counsel together in each other's regard crowned with equity. If you should encounter difficulties, financial or organic, then the child may be nursed at the breast of another
Everyone of pecuniary resources must spend according to his means, and he who is of wanting means to produce the comforts of life shall spend in accordance with what Allah has given him. Allah imposes upon no soul or on anyone the tribute of spending but within the limitations of what He has given him; and behind an instance of hardship, Allah will bring relief
A good many townships contemptuously challenged their Creator's ordinances and the admonitions of His Messengers and We laid their disobedience to their charge and imputed their evil, and requited them with unsparing penalty and a condign punishment
And justly did they taste the fatal consequence of the evil way they conducted themselves in life! And the logical sequence of their behavior was evil consequence and the suffering of a great loss
And Allah has prepared for them an unsparing and condign punishment Therefore regard Allah with the profound reverence dutiful to Him you people of insight who recognize Him with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues. With asseveration did Allah send down to you people the Quran to be mindful of Him and of His prescribed path of righteousness
A Quran personified in a Prophet who features the spirit of truth and the grace of Allah expressing and elucidating to you its expounded revelations in order to guide you into all truth, and to conduct those, whose hearts are impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds of wisdom and piety from want of spiritual or intellectual sight into enlightenment and illumination. Allah shall welcome them into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow; wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity; and be graced with the bounty of Providence
It is Allah Who created seven heavens and of the earth the likeness thereof. His command and controlling power circulate among them; signs indicative of His Omnipotence over all things and inductive to the realization that Allah is acquainted with all the facts and that His Omniscience covers all things in all respects
O you Prophet: Why forbid what Allah has made lawful to you for the sake of giving satisfaction to your wives? Allah is Ghafurun (forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
Allah has ordained for you the path to tread in cases when it is mandatory to make atonement in expiation of your oaths. Allah is your Creator and your tutelary guardian; He is AL-Alim (the Omniscient) and AL-Hakim (the Wise)
And for once did the Prophet speak in confidence to one of his wives but she breached the confidence and played the informer and disclosed to another wife what he -the Prophet- wished to be kept secret, and Allah made that known to him Then when, the prophet, told his wife that he knew that she betrayed his confidence and repeated to her a part of what she said and ignored a part, she exclaimed ; "Who told you this?" he said : "it was made known to me by AL-Alim and AL-Khabir (the fully Cognizant of all things)
If both of you change your minds with regard to past action and conduct and feel contrition and keep Allah in mind, then you have indeed opened your hearts' ears". " And if you challenge him and his wisdom then you must know that Allah, is his tutelary protector and so are the Spirit Gibril (Gabriel) and the pious among the believers, and moreover the angels support him and form his back
If he should divorce you all, Allah may replace you with better wives who would help him accomplish his goal; wives who are submissive with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and deeds with wisdom and piety, who feel contrition and in lowliest plight repentant stand, who are devoted to divine worship and service, they exercise their minds in thought and contemplation, conducive to meditation, wives who may have been previously married or virgins
O you Whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: Save yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is people and stones, guarded by angels who are hard hearted to the infidels and mighty, potent and strong. They never disobey a command given by Allah and they carry out every action they are enjoined to do alt along
Make no excuses on this very Day. It serves you right, you are being requited for the deeds of inequity and the wrong actions you had done
O you Whose hearts: reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues: "In your lowliest plight stand repentant, and feel contrition for all the wrong you have done and view it with dissatisfaction and be sure you will never execute it or the like of it ever again. Perhaps Allah will relent and quit you all His debt and welcome you into gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow". "This is the day Allah shall exclude the Prophet and his companions, who faithfully and steadfastly believed, from infamy, humiliation and disgrace. Their faces glow with light emanating from Allah's countenance and proceeding ahead of them to illuminate the way for them when they contemplate the most difficult and inevitable crossing. Carrying their books bearing their records in their right hands, they pray: "Our Creator complement our light and forgive us; You are Qadirun (Omnipotent over all things)
O you Prophet: strive hard against the infidels and the hypocrites; be unwavering and resolute, hard hearted and obdurate in your course of action. Their abode is Hell, they were born to it, and how evil is the destination
Allah cites an example of those who live with false standards in an ads' atmosphere of piety: the wife of Nuh (Noah) and that of Lut (Lot). They were the two mates who lived their wifehood under two of Our devout worshippers, but they proved false to the trust and to those who trusted them, and so their husbands could not save them from the fatal consequence requited by Allah, and it was said to them: "Take up your abode in Hell with those so destined
And Allah cites an example of those who live in an atmosphere of wickedness but with divine standards: Pharaoh's wife who invoked Allah: "My Creator", she said, "I pray and beseech You to provide me with a dwelling in your heaven's realm and to rescue me from Pharaoh and his tyranny and oppression and from those who do not observe the principles of justice and fair dealing
Also Maryam (Mary) the daughter of 'lmran who guarded herself from being supposed, and maintained the flower of faith and chastity. We sent to her Our Messenger, the Spirit Jibril (Gabril), to breathe life into her and animate a soul in her womb. she submitted to Allah's Authority and His ordinance, and she was one of those devoted to divine worship and service
Extolled is He for His glorious attributes, and extolled is He whose Name is blessed, for it is He Who gives and He Who takes, and in whose hands lies the sovereignty of the universe and He is Qadirun (Omnipotent) over all things
It is He Who created death and life from nothingness in order to try you and to determine which of you performs the better deed, and whether his deeds agree with his words and whether his works are imprinted with wisdom and piety; He is AL-Aziz (Almighty) and AL-Ghafur (Forgiving)
It is He Who created seven heavens one above another; no disproportion nor deformity can you see in the creation carried into effect by AL-Rahman, and so direct your vision toward it again and see if you can find a defect or a flaw
Then again direct your intellectual eye and fix your attention on it, and you will find that vision has deposed your intellect
And We decorated the lowermost heaven with lamps (or heavenly bodies), some of them adapted to be like weapons in pursuit of the evil ones for whom We have prepared torture in the blazes of Hell
As for those who denied their Creator, there awaits them the punishment in Hell. How evil, painful and disastrous is the end for which they are destined
When cast therein they hear it breathing vengeance with fierceness and rage
Almost boiling in resentment in the rage of distemper; as often as a fresh group is thrown within, its keepers ask them: "did you not receive Messenger who was a spectacle and a warning to you all
Yes indeed", they will say, "we had received a man who was a spectacle and a warning to us all, but we declared everything stated to be untrue. We refused to admit that Allah had ever sent down any divinely inspired message, and we thought that in their counsel there remained evident falsehood
And they add, "had we opened our hearts' ears or used our minds' eyes, we would never be among those destined to the blazes of Hell
They will admit the truth of what is charged and so, away with the companions in sin, destined to the blazes of Hell
But those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, their Creator, Whom they cannot apprehend by sight, shall merit forgiveness and a great reward
Whether you converse secretly and whisper the spoken words under your breath or you utter them loudly, He is well acquainted with all that is being said, and with all that you suggest secretly to the mind, and with all that the bosoms store of thoughts and feelings and all that they forge
Should He not know when it is He Who brought all into being and carried the animate and the inanimate into effect? He is AL-Latif (the Gracious Who gives His servants an understanding heart); He is AL-Khabir (the Omniscient)
It is He Who made the earth for you tractable and can be easily managed, and so walk along its tracks and travel through its tracts and resort to the purposes of trade, keeping Allah in mind to help you attain a facile and ready course. And support your life from the sustenance He provided, then back to Him is the return on the Day of Resurrection
Do you-people-feel that secure, and in your minds you are sure, that He Who is in His heaven's realm will not stir the earth to convulse and open up, and in its depths you utterly disappear, and We do away with you
Or do you feel that secure, and in your minds you are sure, that He Who is in His heaven's realm will not drive against you a storm, violent, mad, powerful all round and strong, and only then will it come into your heads that Allah's warning is not a jest, but a pledge of what is to come
People before them O Muhammad, and those of the distant past, had refused to listen to Our warning, and how justly did I condemn them, and how dreadful was the condign punishment
Do they not see the birds above them soaring with extended wings, and at times darting with them folded in? No one can maintain them at that level in the atmosphere but AL-Rahman who made the terrestial air subservient to them. He is indeed Bassirun (Omnipresent), He. sees all that you do and all in all
Who is he who can defend you besides AL-Rahman, albeit he be ready in his most defensible array? Indeed the infidels' minds are befooled by self-conceit
And who is he who can provide you with what is requisite for your sustenance if He holds back His provisions. No one But they persist in obstinacy and inordinate self-esteem, and they counsel deaf and wilfully disobey Allah and reject reality
Does the one who walks stumbling and stooping with his head drooped and his face downwards, turning away from the path of righteousness, compare with the one who walks erect with his mind's eye on the straight path
Say to them O Muhammad : "It is He -Allah- Who brought you into being and gifted you with the power of hearing and seeing, faculties divine, and He endowed you with the seat of feeling, understanding and thought, and the seat of consciousness, intellect and volition". "Yet how little you render thanks in return for the benefits and favours
Say to them O Muhammad: "it is He -Allah- Who has spread you throughout the earth and varied your tongues and your colours".* " Then to Him you shall return and be thronged before Him
They ask: "When will this promised event come to pass if you are declaring the truth
Say to them: "The acquaintance with this fact lies entirely in the hands of Allah and in His power; I am only a spectacle and a warning; I only give you timely notice of impending danger and I caution you against denying Allah
Then when the Day of Judgment comes to be a matter of fact and they face it resolutely, their countenances shall speak a different language, the language of dismay and despair. Now is the encounter with Allah's punishment awaiting the wicked. They will be told: "This is what you defiantly asked for ! and what you were promised
Say to them: "If Allah were to do away with me and with those who followed me, or were to confer on us mercy and bless us with relief", "Who can block the enacted punishment and deliver from it those who are given to disbelief
Say to them: "He is AL-Rahman, we believed in Him and in Him we trust". "And soon will you know who has erred and evidently strayed from the path of righteousness
Say to them: "What if your water suddenly sinks to an unreachable level and disappears"! "Who else can possibly supply you with streaming water, or will listen to you when you crave for assistance, or your prayer for help He hears
(Nun, and by what it represents and what it stands for as a natural symbol of adoration), and the pen -employed in writing with a pen- and by the pen -the instrument of authorship-, (and by what they commit in writing)
That you, Muhammad, are not ungrateful to Allah, your Creator, for the gift He bestowed upon you, nor is the utterance ungrateful to your ear, nor are you uncontrolled by reason or a demoniac possessed by an eviI spirit
And you shall be continually rewarded for relating Allah’s message and for the suffering you endure but - "in your patience possess you your soul
And you are a man of distinguished character; excellent repute and distinct mental and moral constitution
Soon shall you see and so shall they -your opponent- who is the stray who has erred and strayed from the path of righteousness
And soon shall they know who is uncontrolled by reason and who is of unsound mind
Allah your Creator, is He Who knows best those who have wandered from the path of rectitude, and those who have been guided by the spirit of truth into all truth
So conditioned, do not O Muhammad submit to those who deny the truth and suspect you of falsehood
They wish you were flexible and they would come to terms with mutual concessions
Nor listen to the contemptible who always makes an oath to the truth of his statement because he feels he is not taken at his word nor do his actions to his words accord
A gossiper who delights in idle talk, a slanderer who fans the flow of discord
Obstructive to all that is good and commendable, a transgressor who goes beyond the limits prescribed by Allah and justifies the forbidden
Moreover, cruel, hurtful and callous
His manner of acting as representative of feeling, answers his ingratitude to Allah Who has given him wealth and progeny
Whose response to Our Revelations when he applies his ears to them, is: "Tales fabled by those of old
We shall impress on him a stigma of infamy and furnish him with a distorted, contemptuous and ugly disproportionate snout
We have put them -your people- O Muhammad to the test as We had tried the owners of the orchard who decided upon picking up all the fruits by the morrow at dawn to escape notice and evade paying the poor their due. They disregarded alms which are but the vehicles of prayer
No one did they except and the decision was irrevocable
But the orchard was visited by a divine dispensation which did away with it at one blow while they were asleep
So that by morning it stood desolate and bare, and there was nothing left for them to reap
When they woke up they held discourse to hasten the course of action and expedite their desire
Let us go", said one of them, "and do what you have planned to do if you are to serve your purpose
And so they went onward to their orchard whispering to each other as to how they would accomplish their desire
That no indigent shall have the chance to break in and seek any share to which he might aspire
And thus they finally and firmly resolved not to be moved from their purpose and course of action
And when they saw the orchard had been changed out of all recognition and their dreams which they cherished with unreasonable affection were simply a reverie, they said: "We must have missed our way
But having recognized the calamity, they said : "We have suffered a big loss; we will get no return for our labour and effort, and our expectant waiting has come to a moist mirage in desert eyes
The moderate among them said : "Would it not have been befitting, as I advised, had we praised Allah and rendered thanks for the benefits that to us, He has given
Now, they said, "Glory to You, our Creator; we have been wrongful of the actions we harmfully performed yet we knew they are utterly forbidden
Then they turned round on each other in reproach for the ingratitude to Allah and for the idea of evading benevolence to the poor
How denunciated shall we be" they said. "We went beyond the limits prescribed by Allah and offended against the poor and it serves us right
It is hoped that Allah, our Creator, may compensate us for our losses with what is better". And thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood
Such is the retributory punishment, here, for those who go beyond the limits prescribed by Allah and say to their money "my Allah art thou " or " you are my god ", and deny the poor what is due, and greater shall be the punishment Hereafter if only people knew
But the righteous shall Allah admit in the bliss and the beatitude of His heaven’s realm
Or shall We then treat those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, the same as We treat those who do not regard Allah nor His divine law
How could you be so bold -you people- as to think beyond all bounds of prudence and discretion
Or do you people have a Book which was revealed to you and you use it as a valid reference and you apply the rules which bear upon it
And you choose from it what suits you and make use of it as a convenient aid to your intentions
Or did you ratify with Us covenants with unquestionable validity until the Day of Resurrection, and you are then judged according to your desire and expected satisfaction
Ask them O Muhammad "who has championed the idea and shall offer himself as the candidate who presents a firm front and guarantees them against all exactions
Or do they have deities sharing with Allah His divine nature that they incorporate with Him? If so, ask them to bring them over if they are declaring the truth
Wait, a Day shall come when the truth comes to light and their records are exposed, and distress, horror and crushing sorrow are imposed and now they are called to prostrate before their Creator but they cannot
They stand drooping their sight and drooping their souls, hollow-eyed, gazing in bewilderment and fear and gazing their souls away, mortified, despaired of hope and discredited by the base and ignominious cover of their quality and conduct; yet they were admonished in life to bow to the ground in adoration when conditions were wholesome but they did not
So leave to Me the one who refuses to admit the truth of the Quran. We shall give such persons enough rope and allow them free scope, so that they overreach and commit themselves to an evil line of conduct and be swept away in the general cataclysm
I give them respite and delay My action, but My scheme of action is decisive, conclusive, strict and unfailing, it strikes at the root
Or do you invite them O Muhammad and present them with inducements to follow the path of truth and reality for something in return, and so they are charged with a debt that burdens them or brings them under such liability! The truth is that they are obstinate, not that they hold opinions but the opinions hold them
Or do they, of all people, apprehend and comprehend what is by nature not an object of sight and they commit it to writing
So be patient O Muhammad and forbear their faults and limitations until Allah judges between you and them. Be not like (Zun Nun) (Jonah ) who fled his people because of their hostility and neglected his responsibility toward Allah. He went to the sea only to be swallowed by the fish. And in distress and utter darkness, he invoked Allah’s forgiveness and mercy
And had it not been for the grace and mercy of Allah, his Creator, on him, he would have been cast in the open, low on his knees, brought down to a bad and disagreeable condition, discredited with infamy and shame
But Allah relented and quit him all His debt, and with divine grace he came to be of the righteous whose deeds were imprinted with wisdom and piety
When the infidels hear you O Muhammad recite the Quran they turn their attention to you and their eyes almost breathe vengeance; their ill-will and their hatred forged in their bosoms that their tongues must vent, have vented your accusation of being a demoniac
When in effect -the Quran- is but a universal message which people are yet to learn, and an admonition and a counsel of the greatest concern
The absolute reality
What a reality
You just do not know what the Day of Reality is like
The people of Thamud -the Thamudites- and those of 'Ad - the 'Adites denied that Day of the stunning roar concurrent with the collision of the celestial bodies
The Thamudites were destroyed by an overwhelming thunderous convulsion of the earth's surface produced by a natural force within the earth's crust
And the 'Adites were destroyed by a cold terrifying destructive hurricane, merciless, pitiless and unrelenting
Which hurricane was calculated and directed against them for seven successive nights and eight successive days; you could see their dwellings collapsing making fresh victims. They lay prostrate as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees tumbled down by an unruly wind
And now do you see any of them who had outlasted or remained a survivor
And there were Pharaoh and those before him and those of the corrupt cities who wickedly committed the unprecedented sin; all of whom did evil in exchange for good
They disobeyed the Messenger of Allah their Creator, so He stunned them and overtook them by a condign punishment making them unable to hold their own
When the water gained advantage on the kingdom of the shore and inundated the land, We carried you in the Ark which We kept afloat
An incident which was a signal instance serving as a deterrent in order that you preserve its memory and the bowing ear absorbs it
When the trumpet is blown once or sounded and all those in heaven and on earth are dumbfounded
And the earth and the mountains are given a lift and in one crash they are pounded, ending with the wrecks of matter and the crush of the Worlds
There and then has the Hour of Truth come to pass, and has been actuated
And the heavens have been parted asunder, and with frailty they stand shaky and agitated
And the angels now standing in attention, high will eight of them carry your Creator's throne
There and then shall all of you have audience of Allah for judgment, and not a single action of your worldly deeds will be hidden or unknown
Then he who is given his book, bearing his record, in his right hand will joyfully say to those he meets: "there, you may read my book lending radiance of the divine glory
I was convinced", he adds, "of the truth of The Day of Judgement when I would be requited the like for the like
Such persons whose deeds were imprinted with wisdom and piety shall live in comfort and delight
In Gardens exalted and blissful, spectacular and most pleasing to the sight
With fruits on branches springing up and down to be always within easy reach and always in their sight
Welcomed therein, they will be told: "Eat and drink and enjoy all that affords pleasure, in return for the works of equity you had done in the days bygone
But he whose book, bearing his record, is given in his left hand will pitifully say: "I wish I had suffered eternal death then I would never have been given that book
Nor would I have been asked to answer for conduct not knowing what language shall my countenance speak nor what shall it look like
I wish my death were the end and the final catastrophe
What good did my wealth do me
My power, my influence, and my authority have vanished and my realm has collapsed
Seize him, bind him and make fast with a tie
Then throw him in the fire to be tortured but not to die
And fix him upon a chain seventy cubits ( or forearms ) long
Never did he accept, or recognize Allah, the Almighty
Nor did he encourage ministering to the necessities and demands of the indigent
He will not find here any who would afford him help or deliver him from Allah's retributory punishment
Nor will he feed except upon the bloody rotten discharges
Which no one consumes but the wicked who are destined to make their abode in Hell
I swear by all that you can see
And by all that you cannot see
That the words uttered are sacred words expressed by an honourable Messenger -the Spirit or the Messenger- held in high esteem
And not a gifted utterance championed by a poet that you could hardly believe
Nor is it a prophecy foretold by a foreteller that you do not, reflect upon with close attention
It -the utterance- is that of sacred words revealed by Allah, the Creator of the worlds, past present and those to come
And if he -the Messenger- had uttered error against Us and his heart worked iniquity
We. would have smitten him by the right
And We would have broken the continuity of blood flow in his major artery close to his heart besides a grievous woeful future plight
And no one among~ you could defend him from Us
But it -the utterance- is a Revelation to remind those who entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Allah
We do know that among you people are some who refuse to admit the truth of the Quran, albeit it is convincing, and quite clear
And that it has distressed the minds of those who refuse to acknowledge Allah and are satisfied with the age of discord
But it is the Absolute Truth which together with reality does accord
And so, praise the attributes and advance the glory of the Name of Allah, your Creator
Some Pagan once asked: "When do we expect our turn to suffer that punitive punishment and the encounter with the promised Day of Judgement
A retributive punishment stored for the infidels and there is just not any expedient nor anyone in the heaven's realm or on earth that can avert it
A retributive punishment which cannot be averted once it has been decided by Allah Who is the object of effort, ambition and destination; Allah the Provider of the various rates of motion suitable to the various objects
To Him ascend the angels and the souls or the Spirit fast as they press their rate of motion to attain their purpose in a day of Allah's calendar that equals fifty thousand years of the earthly calendar
Therefore endure O Muhammad their attitude with composure, and quietly await the course of events
They -the infidels- see it (that is) that day of the Eventful Event far and away, remote in time
While We, and the believers, see it close at hand and near fulfilment
That is the Day when the heavens shall look like a metallic substance melted in oil
and the mountains shall be like carded wool
and no friend puts a question to a friend or asks about him. This is an endless moment of anxiety and fear to concern oneself even with the closest whom he or she had rendered dear
All of them -the infidels- will see each other but they are dumbfounded, then and there shall the wicked wish he could be redeemed from that endless and severe punishment with the lives of his own children
With the lives of his own wife and brother
With the lives of his kindred who in life afforded him protection
And with the lives of all those on earth, just to escape the horror which doubles all his torment and his woe
But never will he succeed in avoiding the tormenting Hell Fire
The Fire which, with its infernal hiss and crackle, shall burn into his inmost being, but reserves both his physical and mental feeling for the realization of pain and distress which will not abate nor expire
A fire with a magnet influence; it shall irresistibly draw to itself the feet of those who had denied Allah and rejected the truth
Who hoarded wealth and denied it those who deserved alms, for alms are but the vehicles of prayer
Man is wanting in moral strength for endurance, lacking courage and strength of purpose and will, and unduly swayed by grief. He is selfish and he is only concerned with his own advantage to the exclusion of regard for others
If he meets with a misfortune, or he is wedded to a calamity he becomes so full of misery nursing despair with additional notion of querulous utterances
But if he has the luck and heaven prospers him, then he is niggardly, unwilling to give or spend in divine service and he says to his money "my god art thou
But benevolent are those who a. engage in the act of worship with a pious attitude of mind, being well disposed toward Allah
They constantly surrender their very being to Allah and regularly observe their prayers
Who apportion a determinate share of their wealth for charitable contributions
To distribute among those who are needy, who make request for aid, and among those without the means for bare subsistence and among those who are indigent faint souls past corporal toil
Who recognize the Day of Judgment and hold it as true
Who are moved by fear of their Creator’s punitive punishment, here and Hereafter where the flames and the sparks strike like a spear clean through
Which punishment may hit suddenly and be difficult to appease
Who guard their purity and refrain from unlawful congress
Except with their wives and with those of the captives in their hands; an act being then holy and incurs no blame
And who so goes beyond, then such persons are fornicators who have transgressed the commandment of Allah
Who honour their trusts, and their promises they keep
Whose testimonies are credited and their attestation is a witness of their honour
who perform their prayers at the authoritatively determined time and- observe the prayer's sacred rites and solemnities
These and such persons shall be honoured in Gardens of surpassing beauty featuring a state of supreme bliss and supreme felicity
What an incorrect notion and an unfavourable judgement these Pagans have, that without concern they rush to hear you O Muhammad and refuse to acknowledge the Divine truth and they ignore the voice from heaven;, unwilling to comprehend
They disperse right and left in inordinate self-esteem
Do they really expect to take their abode in the Gardens of bliss, and enter into the joy of their Creator! Then they are staking their very lives on some dark hope
Never, but Hell shall be the place where they make abode, and their permanent residency shall be in abodes of pain. We created them from an insignificant fluid and raised them from dust which they very well know
I swear by the Creator of all eastern cardinal points near which the sun rises in its apparent passage through the signs of the Zodiac and the Creator of all the western cardinal points lying opposite those in the east and near which the sun sets, that We are able to effect any changes at will
We are able to replace them -these infidels- by better people and never are We incompetent
so let them O Muhammad keep denying the truth and continue to adhere to their own vain course, and be held by their own opinions and drown themselves in the nonsensical until they resolutely face the Day which they have been promised
the Day when they shall rush out of their graves as if contesting a race toward a specific goal
Drooping their heads in disgrace, gazing in humility and covered with ignominy in requital of their past behaviour and their ignominious role. This is the Day which they have been promised
We sent Nuh to his people to warn them of disobeying Allah lest they should suffer before long His retributory punishment
Nuh said to them: "My people I am sent to you as a spectacle and a warning to caution you in clear and plain words of impending danger and misfortunes
Worship Allah and stand in awe of Him and entertain the Profound reverence dutiful to Him, perform duly what He commends and reject what He forbids, and obey me
He forgives you your iniquities, extends your period of duration, and He cancels your misfortunes and your punishment", " for when Allah's fixed date for punishment is due, it shall not be postponed ever, if only you knew
He -Nuh- said: "O Allah, I admonished my people night and day, dutifully obedient to Your command
But as often as I admonished them to adhere to what is in conformity with truth and in agreement with reality, the farther their opposition ran into the region of prejudice
As often as I invited them to present them with inducements to follow your Commendable path and merit your forgiveness, their ears counseled deaf, and in obstinacy they hugged to their hearts their old irreverent conviction of disbelief, hid their faces and overweened themselves in arrogance and inordinate self-esteem
I also", Nuh continues, " proclaimed to them Your message by public discourse
and openly and secretly did I exhort them, and in secret did I share knowledge with a limited number to promote the cause and observe the essential features in order to secure some end
I said to them: "Invoke your Creator's forgiveness; He has always been Forgiving and has always relented, and quit those who solemnly repented, all His debt
He shall pour down upon you rain and blessings that may bring you into people of Condition
and bestow on you wealth, progeny and manpower, and gardens and orchards abounding in streams and rivers, and make all grace abound in you
Why are you people notably deficient in real reverence for Allah's Authority and you do not entertain the profound reverence dutiful to Him
When His creation evinces both wisdom and Omnipotence. It was He Who created you not only in an orderly manner, but also in progressive stages; from a notfa amshag -zygote- and a clinging organism. you become a rudimentary being -embryo- then you come to be a developing being -foetus- then you come out of the womb a new-born babe, then you grow to maturity. Similarly -and in amore general sense- did He create the universe, from the gaseous stage to the stage of concentration then to the final stage of solidification of cosmic matter and the animate beings from the unicellular to the multicellular to the organific
Nuh added, "do you not see how Allah created seven heavens one above the other and how infinite is the expanse and immense are the constellations. How distant one constellation is from the other and unique in orientation, how an inert moon or any planetary body varies appearance according to the extent of her illumination, how the sun and the moon are made to subserve life and time computation. How the lower heaven has been embellished with countless glittering colossal fiery bodies featuring ornamentation, yet those whom He permits to penetrate deep into heaven find it veiled with darkness as if there were no stars featuring decoration
How in all amid them stood the moon - the satellite of the earth dispensing light to dispel the darkness of the night, and He made the sun candescent and a body giving natural light
How Allah sprang you up from the earth and from it did He make you vegetate and germinate
Then back to it shall He return you at death, and then shall He unearth you and resurrect you at a later date
how He outspread* for you the earth and carpeted it under your feet, and on it He raised mountains** stabilizing and concrete
In order for you to inhabit it and settle on it and to move about as you please
Nuh said: "My Allah, they -my people- disparaged me and disobeyed me, and they obeyed the voice of those who disbelieved the truth and shall profit nothing by their wealth and progeny except to be lost to ruin
With cleverness in circumventing, they had recourse to stratagem
They declared in explicit terms never to renounce their gods nor the idols, designated after legendary righteous men,: Waddun and Suwa'un, nor abandon Yaghutha, Ya'uqa and Nasrun
And with such idols they misled so many"; "therefore, I beseech You Allah to lead the wicked so astray that they sink deeper and deeper into error
Therefore on account of their countless transgressions of the divine laws and their offenses against Allah, they were drowned in the flood, and their disembodied souls have been imprisoned in Hell, and they found no one to afford them protection from Allah's retributory punishment
O Allah, my Creator, Nuh prayed", "I beseech you to leave no one of these sinful infidels dwelling on the surface of the earth
For if You leave them or any of them behind, and You give them respite, they will only mislead your worshippers of future generations and engender none but a wicked, morally depraved, unhealthy and distasteful creature, who will sin his own mercies
Nuh then prayed: "O Allah, my Creator, forgive me and my parents and all who enter my house with Your supreme Majesty imprinted upon their hearts and impressed on their minds, and forgive all the believers among the men and the women; and confer gratuitously on the wicked nothing but ruin and losses here and Hereafter
Say to the people: " I have been inspired by Allah that a certain number of the Jinn listened to the recital of the sacred revelations and said: "we have heard an exceptional Quran
It guides to the path of righteousness and impresses the image of virtue upon the hearts, that it prompted giving credence to it and holding it as true, and never shall we incorporate with Allah, our Creator, anyone else
Exalted be He Who is far above all and beyond all comprehension. Never did He take a wife nor did He beget a son
Now we realize that AL-Shaytan (Satan) and the satanic among us have related to Allah defiant impiety and took delight in portraying falsehood
Nor could we conceive that among the men and the Jinn there would be those who are that wicked as to relate to Allah falsehood
We found that some men among mankind used to plead earnestly to some men among the Jinn for averting evil, but instead, the Jinn inflicted them with material harm and made them shudder with horror and with fear and dread which dwelt without an end
The evil among us -the Jinn- thought as did the evil among mankind that Allah would not send another Messenger anymore nor would He effect resurrection
We touched the lower heaven but we found it filled with stern guards and fiery celestial bodies
Long did we sit peering deep into heaven to spy what is being said or discussed in the heaven's realm. But now he of us who endeavours to pry into the realm is followed by a fiery celestial body and suffers annihilation
Nevertheless we do not know whether those domiciled on earth are destined to suffer or Allah will impress upon their hearts His divine influence which operates in men to regenerate and sanctify and to impart strength to endure trial and resist temptation
Yet among us -the Jinn- are those who are righteous, acting rightly and justly and those proceeding in different directions from that ordained by Allah
We have realized that we will never be able to defeat Allah nor frustrate Him had we escaped
And when we heard the Quran We gave credence to it and held it as true and realized that he who accepts Allah, his Creator, and believes in Him suffers no loss nor injustice
Among us -the Jinn- are those who have surrendered themselves to Allah and others who deviated from what is just and right". "and those who have submitted to Allah have in effect sought the path of safety and righteousness, the path which pleases Allah and invites His mercy on their souls
Those who swerve from the path of righteousness have been destined to be the fuel for Hell
Had they - the Pagans - followed the path of rectitude, We would have blessed them, and heaven would have prospered them with an abundance of rain mixed with blessings, spiritual, moral and material means of sustenance
But We would have also used these blessings to test and try their beliefs and their true inclination and he who falls short of remembering Allah his Creator, will Allah subject him to distressing and condign punishment
Mosques belong solely to Allah, therefore, invoke no one ever with Allah
When the Messenger invoked Allah and recited the Quran, the Pagans among mankind and the Jinn beset him on all sides to suppress the flow of the new faith
Say to them: "I only invoke Allah, my Creator, with whom I incorporate none
Tell them: "It is not within my power to afflict you with harm nor can I steer your mental consent to accept the Faith on the ground of authority
Say to them: "No one can avert Allah's wrath on me if I fail to proclaim the Divine message, nor will I find besides Him anyone to afford me refuge
But I can only submit to you the facts revealed by Allah and deliver to you His Divine Message, and he who disobeys Allah and His Messenger shall suffer Hell wherein he and such persons shall remain forever
And when it is the Day to see what has been promised, there and then shall they realize who has hardly any help to offer and has the least force of numbers
Say to them: "I do not know whether the promised Day of Judgment is close at hand or Allah has ordained that it be remote in time
He -Allah- alone knows the unknown and realizes the unseen and He keeps what is beyond human comprehension and imparts the knowledge thereof to no one
Except to a Messenger whom He chooses and then He besets him on all sides with guardian angels to protect him and protect the Book with which He has put him in trust
But Allah would know whether His Messengers have proclaimed their Creator's messages or they did not and He knows well what is within them and what is without; He has computed everything in a determinate number
O you who are clothed in heavy attire and falling asleep
Stand fair by night except for a little
About half of it or less the little
or about half of it and increase the little, and recite the Quran with measured flow of words and due correlation and interdependence of parts featuring musical sound depending on systematic grouping of notes and producing a harmonious whole
We shall lay on you a momentous message to declare in words and to say it out
The Calm and silence of the dead hours of the night make the soul sensible to the presence of Allah and impress piety upon one's heart and bring on that wisdom which the Divine hand imprints in his works
You have all day long to attend to the world and its pursuits
Always keep Allah in mind and invoke His Name and dedicate yourself to Him and appeal to Him for aid and protection
He is the Creator of the east and the west; there is no Ilah but He; take Him upon trust and depend on Him
Be patient and forbear their -the Pagans- insults, and avoid them nicely, for true nobleness teaches forbearance from so foul a wrong
and leave to Me the wealthy who deny Allah and lack the spiritual apprehension of divine truth and bear with them for a while and put them in respite
We have all sorts of fetters, chains and shackles for the feet to impose restraint, confinement and defeat
And food highly offensive, nauseous and choking, and punishment hurting, afflictive, grievous and causing excruciating pain
One Day the earth and the mountains shall be thrown into earthquakes, volcanoes and convulsions, and the mountains cave in and become like wind- drifted sand
O you people, We have sent you a Messenger who shall bear witness to your deeds and actions just as We sent a Messenger to Pharaoh
But Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger and so he came within the measure of Our wrath which spoke thunder and We subverted him, ruined him and brought him to nought
So if you people deny Allah, how would you avoid the Day of horror which shall make children's hair turn white
It is a Day of violent physical disturbance that rends the heaven to pieces
These revelations present an admonition for him who wishes to follow the path prescribed by Allah, his Creator, and to assent to His system of faith and worship
Allah, your Creator knows that you (Muhammad) and some of those who follow you, engage in the act of worship and meditation, at times, close to two thirds of the night or half the night and other times one third of it to ponder the Revelation. Allah determines the duration of the night and the day; He knew you would not be able to determine the course He prescribed and ordained, and so He gave so merciful a turn to you. Therefore, read of the Quran as much as will put you at ease. He knows that among you there will be those who are suffering from illness, others journeying the land to seek Allah's bounty and others fighting in His cause. Therefore, read of it - the Quran - as much as will put you at ease, and perform your prayers and give alms, for alms are but the vehicles of prayer. Also lend Allah all you can of your benevolence, and whatever you advance of piety toward future security, you shall find it in heaven's realm of such a value that it reimburses you what is indeed profitable and really rewarding and invoke Allah's forgiveness; Allah is indeed Ghaforun (Forgiving) and Rahimun (Merciful)
O you who are garbed from head to foot in heavy cloth
Rise and warn the people of neglecting their duties toward Allah
Advance the glory of Allah and ascribe glory in adoration to His Name
Cleanse your clothes and your heart and mind and imprint your deeds with wisdom and piety and resolution
Refuse to recognize idolatry and things not pertaining to Allah, so that you be free from spiritual and moral pollution
Do not give, expecting to take more than what you have given
and in the cause of Allah exercise patience and bear with others their faults, for in patience possess you your soul
For when finally the h trumpet is sounded
Then it is a momentous Day of heavy consequence, a Day of constraint and constriction
So distressful to those who refused to acknowledge Allah and conform to His blessed will; a day fraught with pain and affliction
Now leave to Me the one whom I brought into being and ushered him into this world helpless, empty, with no progeny and never less alone than when he was alone
Then in affluence did I accord him wealth and abounding resources
and a progeny by his side, who would bear witness to the considerable position he enjoys and the will he enforces
I made him lead an easy life with success and prosperity wherever he set his courses
But his greed is never satisfied and he has always asked for more
Yet how obstinate to Our signs, revelations and ordinances he has been; holding no opinions but they held him and reign in his core
Such persons I will afflict with endless calamities and make the like unable to hold his own
He pondered and he planned
Woe be he, for how he pondered and how he planned
and woe indeed will he be for the way he pondered and planned
Then he directed his intellectual eye and analyzed and scanned
Then he ended with knitting his brows in displeasure and his look expressed disapproval
Then he concluded to turn a deaf ear and to continue in his inordinate self- esteem
Then he said "This is nothing but sorcery assumed by Muhammad from the fables of those of old
Then he added, "it is nothing but words expressed by mortals; words which to our beliefs do not accord
There I will cast him into the pit of Hell named "Saqar
and you just do not know what "Saqar" is like
Its fiercely fiery infernal flames simply consume anything coming their way, but the wicked shall neither die nor live therein
Unkind to mankind; it blackens, then burns their skin, but as often as their integument is consumed it is replaced by a fresh new skin
It " Saqar " is guarded by a body of angels numerically nineteen, massive, robust mighty and severe on strangers
(We assigned to no one but the angels the guardianship of the Fire and We stated their number a) to try those infidels' unsatisfied desire, b) to assure Ahl AL-Kitab, of the Divine Nature of Muhammad's mission, c) to give the faithful reason to consume their wisdom in confidence, d) to give neither party Ahl AL-Kitab and the faithful- an occasion to doubt, e) and to induce the hypocrites, the ill-disposed whose seats of intellect melt away in disease and lassitude as well as the infidels to speak out; and indeed they did. They said: What has Allah meant when He mentioned the Angels' number and what does He mean to fulfill?.Thus does Allah mislead whom He pleases and guides whom He will. and no one knows the number of your Creator's forces but He, and the description portraying « Saqar » is only a reminder to mankind
No, but I swear by the moon
and by the night as it retreats and falls into a swoon
By the apparent ascent of the sun above the horizon at the beginning of the day
That "Saqar" is one of many pits of Hell that is. ghastly and immense
Portrayed to warn mankind
So that he who wishes to proceed to the right path may still have a chance, and he who wishes to lag behind, err and stray will have been warned
Every soul shall be pledged for its deeds
Except those destined to hold he position on the right
Beheld in bliss, they will convey their thoughts reciprocally in talk
With the wicked in their infernal abyss
They will ask them: “ What brought you to "Saqar" ? ”
We were not among those who engaged in worship. " they will admit
Nor did we feed the indigent nor to benevolence did we submit
We always joined those who delighted in idle talk and we were given to indulging in personal vanity and drowned ourselves in the nonsensical
We obstinately refused to acknowledge the truth of Day of Judgment and actuality
Until we were caught in the jaws of death and were affronted with reality
There and then, no intercession can profit them or afford them help
But why would they reject admonition and refuse to take heed
As if they were zebras
Rushing away from a lion in a stampede
Ironically every one of these infidels wants a Scripture to be revealed to him and alone
But no, they deny the Hereafter and their denial of it drives them to seek pleasure in vices instead of virtues and they think what they will is fate
Yet this Quran is the spirit of truth guiding into all truth and inducing those whose hearts' ears are open to lift to Allah their inward sight and keep Him always in mind
He who wishes to do so is left to his conscience to bind
But no wish would be fulfilled until Allah has so willed, He is Reverence personified. He is the Creator Who merits profound reverence and He is the Absolute Source of forgiveness, and to those who repent, perhaps He will relent and quit them all His debt
I swear by the Day of Resurrection
and by the self - reproaching soul
Does man think We are unable to assemble his bones? But indeed We are, even after they have been scattered or reduced to dust
But also each finger tip with its mark or prints We will be able to reconstruct
Indeed, impudent is he who has no shame of his sins
and in positive unbelief he asks as to when is that alleged Day of Resurrection
Then when the sight is dazed by terror and fright
and the moon is eclipsed and reflects no light
and the sun and the moon lose orbit and draw together in one mass and go out of shape
Shall man wonder as to which way to turn in order to have recourse to a shelter as a means of escape
But never; there is no shelter to recourse to
For now to Allah, your Creator, does the one - way journey proceed
There and then shall man be informed of all the good he had done and the evil he committed and of all he had neglected or omitted
Each one shall be his own witness, and his deeds shall be a witness of his worth. He knows exactly all that he had done and he also knows if he had perverted best things to worst abuse or to their meanest use
and of no import shall be his excuse
Do not rush O Muhammad to speak, but hold your tongue and listen to what the Angel relates
We are responsible for imprinting it in your heart and impressing it on your mind, and We are responsible for its compilation and for its perusal
When We read it to you, you follow its intonation
We are responsible for its interpretation
No, but you people value only the life here which is evanescent and ephemeral not lasting and faster than arrows
You ignore the great momentous Hereafter
There and then some faces shall feature radiant countenance expressive of deeply felt joy
derived from the countenance of Allah their Creator, c1othing their souls with the comely vesture of virtue and innocence, as a feature of the visible radiance of the divine
Other faces will be expressive of gloom and dismay
Expecting the calamity of the heavy debt to Allah which they will have to pay
No, but when the death - rattle is impending and it is time for the soul to part
and a hopeless effort is being made in search of a healer to restore his soul
But it is concluded that death is impending and he is to depart
Now both legs are laid across each other in preparation
For a one - way journey; and to Allah his Creator is the destination
No, but he was never disposed to benevolence nor did he engage in the act of worship
But he had refused to acknowledge the divine message and closed his heart's ears to the truth
and among his people he walked upon air and exercised self – conceit
So now, it serves you right
Indeed it serves you right
Does man think he could do what he will and act without restriction or limitation and neglect his duties and his obligations to Allah, and get away with it
Was he not a Notfa (sperm) in a seminal fluid that is emitted
Then by union with its counterpart it became Notfa Amshag* "zygote" which developed into a clinging organism. Then Allah has given it form and shape, proportions and a constitution ensuring that the individual is not alone human, but unique - from the pattern of the finger prints to the number, colour, shape and length of the eyelashes, - ref. Human Embryology M.j.T.Fitz Gerald M.D., London
and from this male seed "sperm" did He make the two sex divisions of organic beings the male and the female
Absolute as He is, Will He not be able to raise the dead when all creation is His
Was there not an era when man was not even heard of
We created man from the product of the union of two Notfas "sex cells" Notfa Amshag "Zygot" with the surest standard by which to test his tendency, and We endowed him with the gifts of hearing and vision, faculties divine
We guided him and conducted him to the right way which We ordained to be the course of life and conduct, and left him to choose to be grateful or to deviate from what is just and right
We have prepared for those who deny Allah chains, yokes and blazing Fire
But the righteous shall enjoy a drink with the distinctive fragrance and the distinguished savour of "kafoor" which excites relish and affords delight
Streaming from a source reserved especially for those who served Allah Whose object was the heart of their purpose and to Him, they lifted their inward sight
Those who kept their vows and feared a Day whose evil is far-reaching
For the love of Allah, they fed the indigent, the orphan and the captive, (believers or unbelievers), in spite of their attachment to the object they offer, thereby setting a good example and an excellent guide
Their true and hidden motive as expressed in words to those in need has always been : "We supply you with the necessities for the sake of Allah and the enjoyment induced". "We expect nothing in return, not even your gratitude
We dread Allah's righteous indignation on an endless drastically distressful Day
Consequently has Allah ensured them immunity from the evil of that Day and shall inspire them with lightened eyes and radiant countenance expressive of deeply felt joy
For their patience, there await them the abode in bliss and the exquisite silken attire
Reclining on thrones, they do not suffer the heat of the sun nor experience the bitter thrust of the cold, only the divine warmth to which they aspire
Enjoying themselves under delightful foliage afforded by trees whose fruits excellently adorn, as with blazonry, the branches springing up and down to be always within easy reach
They are served by handsome attendants for the table, where the food is dished in silver utensils, and the drinks in vessels of exquisite transparency
Vessels of translucent silver, like to the glorious sun’s transparent beams, whose extent has been prescribed to satisfy individual needs
They are served with drinks flavoured with zanjabeel of paradisiacal quality and splendour
Streaming from a fountain named Salsabeel, a name descriptive of its features of beauty, solemnity and the grandeur of its course and its flux; features causing the colours and the flow to blend in a music of tranquility
They are attended by perpetually young attendants -beauty personified- They have combination of qualities affording pleasure to the sense of sight and you would think they are sweet gentle radiance blazoned with fine rows of precious pearls
If you were to take a look O Muhammad, what will you see but bliss and splendour, a realm of magnificence and ecstasy and the loving kindness and mercies so tender
Brilliant figures dressed in green fine silk ornamented with brocade and wrists adorned with silver bracelets, and blessed be they with Allah's pure and divine drink which cleanses their hearts and their souls
To honour them, they shall be told : "Such magnificent reward has been apportioned to you to enjoy, and on your high endeavour shall the light of praise eternally shine; an endeavour with Grace divine imbued, and has been accepted with gratitude
We are revealing to you the Quran in successive stages to be impressed upon your heart, and your effort be imprinted by the Divine hand
So in response to My divine favours, be patient and await your Creator’s, command. Do not obey the sinner among them nor those who deny Allah and the hypocrites, nor any who wishes to obstruct your way
Celebrate Allah's Name your Creator. at the beginning and the end of the day
and at night bow to the ground in adoration and advance the glory of His Name and exercise your mind in thought and contemplation
These people -the infidels- think only of this world which is but evanescent, not lasting and faster than arrows, and they ignore an eventful Day of great momentum and heavy consequence
We created them and gave them enough will power to withstand temptation. When We will, We can replace them by others and effect a new creation
This is an admonition for him who chooses to follow the path prescribed by Allah his Creator. and ponder the Quranic Revelation
Nor can you exercise your will without Allah's accord; He has always been Alimun (Omniscient) and Hakimun (Wise)
He accepts whom He will and bestows His grace and mercy on whom He will and for the wrong-doers has He prepared a tormenting punishment, taking them from the highest stage of honour to the lowest stair of disgrace
By the winds blowing in any of the four directions and of gradual degrees of force perceptible to the senses
Then they become high, causing violent disturbance of the atmosphere and may engender a storm
and by the winds carrying clouds* floating at various heights and scatter them and drift them to where a nimbus must form
and by the angels carrying Allah's Messages to His Messengers heralding the standard by which anything is judged right or wrong, virtuous or immoral, permissible or forbidden
Then they disclose to them -to the Messengers- Allah's revelations and ordinances which inspirit the faith
To admonish the responsive who opens his hearts' ears and warn the irresponsive, who turns a deaf ear
That all that you have been promised, from resurrection to judgment and paying off the equivalent will come to pass
When the stars are dimmed and emit no light
And the heaven is split asunder
And the mountains melt and disappear out of sight
and at a later deferred date shall all the Messengers be made to convene
But as to which day has the Messengers convention been postponed and when will it then be made to supervene
It has been postponed until the Day of decision and adjudication
You just do not know what this Day of decision and adjudication is like
Woe then, to those who looked upon the truth as manifest falsification
Did We not destroy those who charged Our Messengers with falsehood among the predecessors
and in like manner did We destroy the successors
Thus do We requite people given to sin
Woe then, to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood
Did We not bring you into being from a contemptible fluid, an ejaculation
Fluid whose product, the fertilized seed,* We embedded in the depth of a safe and secure situation (the womb)
For a determined period of gestation
We then determined, besides the span of this period, the relevant constitution and how right is the determination
Woe then, to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood
Did We not make the earth widely spread
To accommodate the living and the dead
Did We not establish therein firm mountains* to afford stabilization, and furnish you with a supply of fresh water from springs, rain fall and other sources, each, in a blessed stead
Woe then, to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood
There and then shall the wicked be told "Now suffer the consequence of what you denied and treated as falsehood
Go to the blaze, with its fumes and scarlet shade and its flames that are shooting out in three colossal branches
Which neither screen, nor hide nor protect from the heat or from the blazing flames streaming in avalanches
Fire throwing off sparks as immense as the fortress
Sparks looking like huge implements covered with copper troubling the infidels grievously and subjecting them to a severe distress
Woe then to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of what is false
This is the Day they are dumbfounded and unable to talk
Nor are they permitted to plea in justification of their deeds of inequity nor of the deeds which with their words did not accord
Woe. then to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood
This is the Day of decision and adjudication, and thereon will We throng you all including all who came before
Now if you have a plan to evade judgment, conduct it to conclusion if you can
Woe then to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of what is false
But the righteous who keep Allah in mind with bosoms filled with reverential awe are amidst cool shades and spectacular springs
and delicious fruits to their hearts’ desire and all that righteousness merits and the felicity it brings
They shall be told: "Eat and drink and enjoy all that affords pleasure in return for your deeds and actions which involved effort directed to a definite and commendable end
For thus do We reward those whose deeds are imprinted with wisdom and piety and the benevolence they spend
Woe then, to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood
You infidels may eat and enjoy yourselves here, but the span is short and then your iniquities shall be laid to your charge
Woe to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of falsehood
When told to engage in the act of worship and to humble themselves to Allah and bow down to Him in adoration, they refuse
Woe then. to those who looked upon the truth as an intentional assertion of what is false, for nothing then will serve as an excuse
What then will convince them if this Quran does not
what now are they asking about
is it the great news of resurrection
the subject of dispute between those who argue in favour and those who argue against it
No, but they shall soon come to know
No, but indeed they shall soon come to know. Then Allah reminds them by drawing their attention to His omnipotence; He says
Did We not prepare the earth to be a settled habitation
and the mountains as stays that afford stabilization
We created you in pairs
We made your sleep* a repose for relief and recuperation
and the night a vestment and black was the colour chosen to absorb all light emanating from the cosmic sources of illumination
We made the day-time luminous for activity and livelihood
We built above you seven fortitudinous heavens vast and with endless amplitude
We installed a lamp glowing dispensing heat and illumination
We sent down from the rainy clouds water affluent and at times involving succession
To bring forth therewith grains and vegetation
and thickly foliaged orchards and gardens of delightful variation
Indeed the Day of Judgment foreordained falls at an absolute time Predestinated
This is the Day the trumpet is sounded and you come together in throngs embodying your souls and fully actuated
and the heaven is opened typifying open doors for the adminission of all
and the mountains are set in motion and into a mirage as if transmigrated
There and then hell is made to lie in wait
It is the destined abode of the transgressors wherein they are designated
Therein, they remain for ages as has been predestinated
They will taste no coolness for relief nor a drink to quench their thirst
But only boiling water and their rotten discharges for doing their worst
A requital commensurate with deeds
They never believed they would be judged
and Our revelations and signs they charged with falsehood and insolently did they negate
But everything We kept on record and in a book did We incorporate
Now taste the outcome of your deeds and plenty of the same will We increase and perpetuate
But for the righteous there is victory in the attainment of their goal
Orchards and vineyards
Companions of like age featuring highest quality of attractive femininity
and a cup full of delightful drink, clear, pure and really good
No vanities shall they hear therein nor is it the place for falsehood, or discord
A recompense from Allah, your Creator and a reward greatly in accord
Creator of the heavens and the earth and all in between. AL- Rahman, with whom no one can hold discourse nor shall an argument be allowed to intervene
This is the day when the spirit Jibril (Gabriel) and the angels stand in lines and keep silence at its height, except he whom AL-Rahman permits and then he says what is right
Indeed this is the day of truth, and who so desires may still turn to Allah, his Creator, for tutelary protection
We have warned you of punishment evident and quite near that deserves attention. On the day it comes to pass shall every one look at his deeds, the lawful and the lawless which his wrongful and unclean hands had committed. The infidel shall wish, then, he had remained mere dust
By the angels who violently disembody the souls of those who die captivated by disbelief and discord
and by the angels who tenderly disembody the souls of those who are with Allah in accord
and by the angels who convey an act of Allah's mercy, vouchsafed to His creatures
Then they press forward competing to be foremost
Then they execute the Allah's commands, and conduct the affairs
The day shall come when the trumpet is sounded and the universe goes into a violent convulsion
To be followed by the second sound when all shall go in extreme commotion
All hearts are then in extreme agitation
All eyes are cast down in humble modesty and utter humiliation
Yet people in their doubt, wonder whether after interment they could be restored to their former state
They cannot perceive how! "when bones disintegrate
Should this be true", they say, "it will mean immeasurable loss and condign punishment
Indeed all it takes is only one single rallying cry
and there they declare themselves on the surface of the earth
Have you heard O Muhammad of the narrative of Mussa
When Allah, his Creator, called him while he was in the sacred valley of Tuwa
Go to Pharaoh", Allah said, "for he has gone beyond all limits and all bounds he transgressed
Say to him: "Would you like to follow a path that leads you to righteousness and purity
I will guide you to the path of Allah your Creator, and thus you will find your innermost thoughts and being have become sensible of Him and your secret feelings will urge you to pay your duty to Him
Then Mussa, showed him the great act featuring Allah's Omnipotence and Authority
But Pharaoh refused to admit the truth and favoured disobedience
He turned his back to contend the truth with falsehood
He thronged the place with an audience and made a proclamation to satisfy his day dream
He said: "I am your lord supreme
But Allah punished him in requital as a caution against further transgression and made of him an example in this world, and worse shall his punishment be in Day of Judgement and adjudication
Indeed, in this event there is an instructive example to those who fear Allah and dread His indignation
Are you people the more difficult to create, or the heaven which He constructed
He lifted it up so high and its vast dimensions did He perfect and with celestial bodies did He complete it and its realms did He actuate
Its night did He darken and the day did He pervade with light and illuminate
and the earth did He prepare for life at a later date
He exteriorized its water and out of it did He spring its vegetation
and the mountains He set and anchored for stabilization
All being instrumental in supplying provisions for you and for your cattle
Then when the calamitous eventful event comes to pass
Man will then remember all he did
and Hell is brought in view for all to see
Then he who had transgressed
and chose to give himself to the life of this world and its vanities
Hell, for him, is the abode
But he who feared the moment of audience of his Creator and endeavoured to make his pious principles and his words together accord, and restrained himself from vanities and discord
Paradise, for him, is certainly the abode
They ask you O Muhammad as to when is the time of this proclaimed Hour
But how could you satisfy their query when you yourself do not know
It is only with Allah your Creator, that the knowledge of the appointed time rests
You are only there as a spectacle and a warning to him who fears it and on the wings of righteousness he rode sublime
On the day they eye-witness the Event, it appears to them in retrospect as if it were only an afternoon or a forenoon that they actually spent
He, -the Messenger- frowned and turned away
When the blind man came in (and interrupted his exhortation to some of the Qurashite nobilities who tried to suppress his mission and stood in his way)
You Muhammad do not know; he -the blind man- may well hug faith to his innermost thoughts and to his innermost being and commend his secret feelings to Allah
Or he might ponder what he learns and profit by it
But he who is rich, with abundant means at command
You give him attention, hoping he would submit
Yet you are absolved if his disbelief in Allah does not remit
But he who comes to you seeking authoritative counsel and admonition
With heart full of reverence and mindful of submission
you are unmindful of him and you give him little attention
No indeed, but let this incident be an admonition
and he who wishes, may keep Allah in mind and imprint in his heart His Glorious Quran which conduces to piety and to contrition
A Quran recorded in Books, honoured and highly esteemed
Exalted, absolute and pure honourably deemed
Recorded by Scribes emblematic of trust
Honourable, pious and just
Accursed be man, how he fights against his own good the best he can
From what primordium did Allah create him
From a seed in fluid emitted did He create him and animate, and his dimensions and his life span, his provisions and his lot did He determine, and his intellect did He actuate
Then He guided him to the path of safety and righteousness and his course did He facilitate
Then He occasioned his death and in the grave did He deposit and inanimate
Then when He wills, He shall resurrect him and animate
But no, he never fulfilled what Allah has commanded and ordained
Let man take a look at his food
We poured down rain-water in quantities which stream and flow
Then We split the earth and break up the soil to allow water in and vegetations to grow
Therein We grew edible grain
Grapes and herbage
Olive trees and palm-dates
Gardens of perennial and other purposeful trees
and fruits and fodder
Sustenance for you and for your cattle
Then when the deafening uproarious eventful Event* comes about
Man shall then flee from his own brother
From his mother and his father
and from his wife and his children
For each of them then, there is enough trouble of his own
Some faces will then be beaming
Smiling and rejoicing in all seeming
Other faces will be coated with gloom
A painful depressing darkness they shall assume
These are the wicked infidels who impudently defied admonition
When once the sun is contracted and loses light and becomes dim
The stars emit no light, lose aspect, contribute to cosmic catastrophes and they are no longer in trim
The mountains are put in motion and vanish
The precious pregnant she - camels are forsaken
The wild beasts are thronged
The seas boil and become inundated
The like are consorted with the like, joined in companionship and associated (or the souls embodied)
The entombed - alive female infant is asked
For what guilt was she made to suffer infanticide
And when the records are laid open and are open wide
And when the heaven is erased
And when Hell is blazed
And when Paradise is brought close at hand
Then, every soul becomes fully cognizant of what she brought along of deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety or works imprinted with iniquity and impiety
I swear by the heavenly bodies that recede
The planets which in a retrograde motion do proceed
And by the night when she feels her way and then softly moves away
And by the morn when it draws the breath of relief and heyday
That it -the Quran- is the word of Allah conveyed by a distinguished Messenger Jibril (Gabriel) who is regarded with honour
He is quite powerful and he is endued from the Throne of grace with high esteem
And he is obeyed in the realm and to his trust he is faithfully supreme
Nor is your companion the -Prophet Muhammad- possessed by an evil spirit
For he certainly saw him -the angel Jibril- at the clear horizon
Nor should he be accused of withholding any heavenly or divine knowledge of the unseen
Nor is it -the Quran- the word of an accursed spirit
How could you think this way and where can you turn
This Quran is but a universal message and an admonition of great concern
For him who, among you, wishes to follow the path of rectitude which is the path in the main
But even then you cannot exercise your will unless it be Allah's will; He is the Creator of the worlds
When once the heaven is cleaved asunder
And the planets are scattered
And the seas are overflown and gain advantage on the kingdom of the shore
And the graves are turned upside down and their contents are discharged and ejected
There and then shall every soul become aware of what it did in its early chapter of life and what it did of late
O man! what has enticed you to be audacious and disloyal to Allah, your Creator, the. Most Beneficent
Who created you and proportioned you and gifted you with interdependent systems to make you an organized whole, and in the upright position* He made you efficient
In whatever form He wills, He shapes you; not to mention, complete defective or deficient
No, but you refuse to acknowledge Allah and do not admit the truth of the Day of Judgement
Yet, in point of fact you are watched by guardian angels who do not recede
They are honourable Scribes
Who know and record every deed
The virtuous shall surely be destined to the heavenly bliss
The wicked shall surely be in the fiercely blazing abyss
A fate, they will suffer in Day of Judgement
They shall not be delivered therefrom nor are they given relief
You just do not know what the Day of Judgement is like
Indeed, you just do not know what the Day of Judgement is like
It is the Day when no soul can avail another nor is there a. safe path to strike, for the full command there and then belongs entirely to Allah
Woe are those who fraudulently scant the measure
When they buy from people they insist on a full measure that will not abate
And when they sell to them they fraudulently scant the measure or the weight
Do they not think they will be resurrected
On a great and eventful Day
A Day when all people shall rise and stand before Allah the Creator of the worlds
No, but now the register of the wicked points out to Sijjeen, the dungeon of the deep dark vault
And you just do not know what Sijjeen is like
The Register incorporates all those irrevocably destined to Sijjeen
There and then denounced shall be those who denied the truth and disagreed with reality
Who declared the Day of Judgment to be untrue and not an actuality
No one denies it but a transgressing impudent sinner
Who closes his heart's ears to Our revelation when rendered to him in discourse and says: "Tales fabled by those of old
No, but what deafened their hearts' ears and made them irresponsive was the blight which their hearts acquired through their ill deeds and woeful story
There and then shall they be excluded from the joy of being sensible to their Creator’s light and glory
That is besides suffering the blazing Hell Fire
There and then shall they be told: "This is the truth which you had always denied to satisfy your vain desire
But the Register of the righteous points out to 'Elliyeen elation and glory
You just do not know what 'Elliyeen is like
The Register incorporates all those irrevocably destined to Elliyeen
It is attested to by the angels nearest to Allah (that)
The virtuous shall he in the beatitude of the heavenly bliss
Gracefully seated, they see the wicked but they look at Allah's light and glory
You recognize in their expressive features the radiance of delight and their delightful story
They are served from sealed nectarian containers with drinks most inviting
Drinks that end with a musky flavour, delicious and righting; an inspiring goal for which may compete those whose ambition is the heavenly bliss
It is blended with ingredients taken from a watery source Tasneem; of quality supreme
Which is a spring reserved only for those nearest to Allah
Those who criminally denied Allah used to laugh at those who faithfully believed
When they went by them they winked to each other and treated them with ridicule
And when they returned to their people they returned with a mouth filled with laughter in contempt
When they saw the believers or met with them they said: "These are indeed the erring faction
As if they were sent to watch their action
And so, today, -Day of Judgment- the situation is being reversed; it is the turn of Allah's devotees to laugh at the infidels, scorn them and hold them in disdain
Gracefully seated, the devotees will direct their eyes at Allah's light and glory and be thankful for the favourable gain
Now have the infidels not been requited with what is commensurate with what they did
When once the heaven is split asunder
In obedience to the command of its Creator and in payment of its duty to Him
And when the earth is stretched out
And disgorges its contents and empties itself of the dead
In obedience to the command of its Creator and in payment of its duty to Him; there and then shall people be adjudged
Remember O man, you are arduously labouring and painfully toiling toward your Creator Whom you shall meet in the end
Then he who is given his book bearing his record in his right hand will have no cause to apprehend
His reckoning will be gracefully conducted
And to his people will he go back rejoicing and greatly delighted
But he who is given his book, bearing his record in his left hand from the back
Will wish he could perish
He will suffer the blazes
How vainly did he rejoice among his people before and disregarded the concord of this discord
He emphatically thought he would never return to his Creator, Whom he never recognized nor adored
But in effect Allah, his Creator had kept him in view and was fully aware of his actions
I swear by the glow of light and display of colour in the sky at the close of the day when the sun sets
And by the night when life closes its lids and past events come to memory and the night-eyed can see and the night wanderer wanders about and the soul roves heaven’s realm
And by the moon at full when its entire disk is illuminated thus dispelling the darkness of the night
That you people shall ride from one circumstance to another and from one mode of existence to another and from a state of things, in which events stand disposed at a particular time, to another, and from one world to another; for in the actual system of things man changes, from one condition to another. He is governed by the inherent dominating power by which actions and feelings are determined
What then prevents them -the infidels- from justifying faith as a conviction operative on their character and will
When the Quran is recited to them, they neither open their hearts' ears nor their minds to stand in awe of Allah and bow to the ground in adoration
No, but the infidels inherently deny the truth which they obstinately reject and the path of righteousness they tend to deviate from
Allah is fully cognizant of what they conceal in their hearts and what is forged in their bosoms and He knows that infidelity is their very prevalent inclination
Therefore, tell them O Muhammad to expect a condign punishment
But not those who believed with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues and with deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety; these are destined to a fortune that is elate, and they will be requited with a reward which will not abate
By the heaven that has been furnished with Zodiacal Signs
And by the day of which promise has been made; a promise affording a ground of expectation of judgment to come
And by the witness who will give evidence in relation to matters of fact when an account of one’s life is being rendered at judgement, and by the deeds which had been witnessed and will be the witness of one’s worth
Accursed above all and devoted to perdition shall be those who cut the trench to trench on the liberty of the innocent and enjoyed witnessing their torture, their torment and their agony
Fire was set in the. trench and supplied with fuel to burn those who surrendered themselves to what is dutiful to Allah
The accursed sat around the fire and regaled themselves
They witnessed and enjoyed what they were doing to those who recognized Allah with hearts impressed with the image of religious and spiritual virtues
They took a cruel, vengeance on them for no reason other than their recognition of Allah AL-Aziz (the Almighty) and AL-Hamid (the Worthy of all praise)
Allah to whom belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; the AL- Shaheed (the Omnipresent who witnesses all things)
Those who persecuted the believers among the men and the women and did not repent, shall have the painful requital in Hell and shall suffer the blazes
But those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety shall have gardens of surpassing beauty beneath which rivers flow; and such rapturous delight and elation shall triumph those favoured
The blow of Allah your Creator, is hard and strong
It is He Who creates and re-creates all along
He is the Forgiving Who compassionates whom He sees in distress
He is Allah Who occupies the Glorious Throne
Who carries into effect what He will
Did you not hear O Muhammad of the narrative of what had become of the hosts
The forces of Pharaoh and the Tribe of Thamud
Yet the infidels persist in labeling everything as falsehood
Allah hangs on their rear and besets them on all sides
Never you people doubt, for this indeed is a glorious Quran
Derived from the archetypal text which is preserved in heaven's realm
By the heaven and the celestial body which makes a strong impression upon the sense of vision
And you just do not know what the celestial body which makes a strong impression upon the sense of vision is like
It is the penetrant fiery celestial body which strikes to gain admittance into the terrestrial air
That every soul is but protected by a guardian angel who watches over innocence and folly
Let man ponder from what was he created
He was created from fluid that is simply emitted and ejaculated
He -man- issues forth at birth From the space between the bony pelvis and the breast-bone, the course that is normally negotiated
Does this not show that Allah is Omnipotent enough to have him recreated
That is on the Day of Resurrection, when secrets are brought into the open and man’s countenance will reveal, against his will, all he had hoped would be kept secret and will betray him to his fall or to his exultation
This is the Day when no one shall have power, nor find anyone to afford him help nor impede his prostration
By the heaven and what it returns of condensed water vapour as rain and what it reflects of the various kinds of waves
And by the earth which splits to allow plants to grow
That it- the Quran- is an authoritative revelation and a cannon of faith that is conclusive, determinate and decisive
And not the object of ridicule nor is it derisive
They - the infidels - in their effort to misguide people and divert them from Allah's path keep plotting and continue to scheme
And I -Allah- plan an unfailing scheme
And so, overlook their actions O Muhammad and give them respite; their plots will be of no avail, and Allah's purpose shall prevail
Glorify the Name of Allah, your Creator, the Supreme
Who created all beings and made them well proportioned, and kept the creation in equilibrium
Who guided every being to its befitting course and endowed all beings with the impulses determining their direction to a definite end, and He has indicated to man the path of misery and that of happiness and left him to choose his way
Who also brings forth the vegetation
Then He makes it decay and causes its degeneration
We shall make you recite so that you will not forget
Except as Allah will repeal at a later date; He knows what is avowed openly and the open course of action, and He knows what the breasts forge and what they store of thoughts and feelings and all that is suggested secretly to the mind and He knows all that you do out of sight
We shall facilitate your task and lead you to the facile and ready course
And so, exhort. any who is willing to open his heart's ears and favourably responds
The responsive will be he who reveres Allah with bosom filled with reverential awe
And it -the admonition- will be avoided and unwelcomed by the ill- omened, the unfortunate against whom have been denounced curses and woe
Who will suffer in Hell the immense fire
Wherein he does not die nor live or respire
But blessed, indeed, is he who vindicates his own wrongs and is kindly disposed to benevolence
Who calls Allah his Creator, to mind and engages in the act of worship, doing to Him sincere reverence
But you people prefer the life here afore the heavenly b1iss, knowing it is illusive and alluring
While the Hereafter is far better, blissful, infinitely lasting and enduring
This indeed, has been emphasized in the earlier Scriptures
The Scriptures of Ibrahim and Mussa
Have you been informed of the great talk apropos the overwhelming Event
Some faces are then incensed with humiliation
Reflecting the heedless life they spent uselessly, unprofitably and improvidently; and now they look faint and sick with travail and fear
They are entering into Hell, to suffer the intense heat of the blazing Fire
Only to be given to drink from water bubbling in agitation and issuing from a boiling hot spring
And nothing will they feed on but poisonous, noxious, foul thorny shrubs
Which neither nourish nor pacify their hunger pains
There will be other faces radiant with delight
Pleased with doing their endeavour in life lifting to Allah their inward sight
Enjoying the exalted gardens of Bliss
No matter of little value or insignificance will they hear therein, nor will they hear ill - tongues or what is morally evil
Therein is water streaming forth from a delightful spring
Therein are dignified seats covered with embroidered cloth woven in gold and ornamented with brocade
And drinking glasses set at hand
And cushions, ranked in rows, so bedecked and ornate
And rich carpets all round
Do they - the pagan Arabs - not ponder how camels* were created
How the heavens* have been distantly elevated
How the mountains* which stabilize the earth have been firmly erected
And how the earth has been expanded* and prepared for life thereon
You just continue to exhort the people, for you are here to put them in mind of Allah
And no authority have you over them
But he whose attitude has served to disincline him from doing reverence to Allah and to turn a deaf ear to all He has ordained
Will He requite him with a condign punishment and in Hell will he forever, be detained
Unto Us shall be their return
And then, their judgement will be Our concern
By the dawn and its mystery and what it entails of religious rites
By the ten highly esteemed sacred nights
And by the contrasted yet related, the even and the odd
And by the night when it flows along its way, then it softly moves away
Is there not enough assertion in these corroboratory facts for those who ponder
Did you not see how Allah, Your Creator, dealt with the people of ‘Ad, the Adites; (said to be fifth generation of descendants of Noah)
And with their city of Iram with its lofty and strong architectural pillars imposing, by reason of beauty coupled with magnitude that was indeed grand
The like of which was never created in the land
And how He dealt with the people of Thamud, who hewed out of the huge rocks in the valley outstanding buildings
And how He dealt with Pharaoh who impaled people on the stakes
All of whom practiced tyrannies in the land
They encouraged mischief therein and promoted an age of discord
In consequence did Allah, your Creator, requite them with. painful misfortunes which together with their principles and practice well accord
Allah your Creator is ever vigilant, He pays off the equivalent
When Allah tests man by crediting him with plenty, he immodestly says: "Allah, my Creator, has ministered to my necessities and honoured me with gratification
And when He tests him by restricting his means, he despairingly says: "Allah, my Creator, has disregarded me and reduced me to humiliation
No, but you do not take good care of the orphan to make him feel comfortable and secure
Nor do you encourage benevolence to the indigent who is really poor
You eat greedily all you can get of the inheritance
And you love to hoard wealth inordinately
No, but indeed when the earth will be severely pounded
And there come Allah, your Creator, with His angels ranked in row after row
And then Hell is brought face to face, and there is no escape from the encounter with the infernal hiss and crackle of the flame. Now man remembers his deeds, but how late it is to hope for a better fate
He will wish he had done better in life than what he used to perpetrate
But then no one requites for sins the way Allah does
Nor does anyone bind in captivity the way Allah makes fast with bonds
O you, the untroubled soul
Return to Allah, your Creator, pleased and blessed
Join My devotees
And take up your abode in My Paradise
I swear by this sacred town -Macca
In which you are being an inhabitant, the town which in due time shall open to you its gates and deliver to you O Muhammad its key to accomplish what you will, respected, vindicated and venerated
And I swear by the father –Adam- or –Ibrahim (Abraham)- and what he procreated
That We created man and set him on earth wherein he strives and struggles from womb to tomb, each according to his disposition and inclination and whether he will acknowledge resurrection and adjudication
Does he think no one can overpower him or he will not be called to account
He boastfully says: "I spent too much money", when it was not for a good cause
Does he think no one could see him, not even Allah
Have We not given him a pair of eyes for vision
A tongue and a pair of lips for eating and talking and pronouncing a decision
We showed him both paths, that of virtue and that of vice
Yet he has not been eager to challenge his way through the path of virtue and attempt the difficult path of overcoming self-interest
And you just do not know what the difficult path of overcoming self- interest
It is the freeing of a slave
Or feeding one in need on a day of privation
Such as an orphan of your kin or blood-relation
Or an indigent who is in dire need
Besides being one of those characterized by piety in every deed, who enjoin forbearance under provocation, bear with others their faults and limitations and enjoin endurance of pain, trouble or evil and constancy in labour, exertion or effort and show compassion toward suffering fellow-creatures, being disposed to forgive and exercise mercy
Such persons have rightfully earned the seat on the right
But those who rejected Allah and His authoritative signs and divine revelations are the ill-omened who have deservedly earned the awkward position on the left
Who are destined to be exposed to a perpetual fire in closed cells where there is no escape and of all hope they are bereft
By the sun and its daylight
By the moon which follows it when first seen shortly after their apparent proximity or conjunction
By the day which exposes the sun’s glory and exposes the earth to sight
By the night which keeps the sun out of view and the earth veiled to sight
By the heaven and the way it was constructed
And by the earth and the way its expanse was conducted
And by the soul and how it was made to comprehend the difference between right and wrong and how its contrary attributes were divinely inducted
And how He inspired the self with self-abuse and self-indulgence, as well as with reverence and vindication and self-sacrifice and adaptation
Successful indeed will be he who is endowed with the attribute of self- reproach and self-judgment, who listens to such advice as Allah propounds
And a loser indeed will be he who has perverted himself and by the hand of sin he is bound
The people of Thamud rejected the truth, brought to them by Allah's Messenger - Saleh -, through impudent transgression
And there, did their most wicked leader jump at the occasion to defy Allah's ordinance and prompt the aggression
Allah's Messenger warned them against harming Allah's She- Camel and advised them to let her drink
But they considered him a liar; they disabled the She-Camel by cutting her hamstring muscles; and so Allah pounded them away in requital of their criminal deed, and of all hopes they were dashed to the ground
For Allah fears no consequences nor to anything ever He is bound
By the night when its shades of darkness serve as a veil
And by the day-light and the illumination that emanates from it and does prevail
And by the creation of the, male and the female
That your endeavour you people to attain your goals is diverse; to some, righteousness is but a goal to their will, others in vanity they waste their days, others compromise between opposite motives and exercise adjustment of rival courses of action, and others attain it through benefaction
So that he who gives gratuitously and fears Allah indeed
And solemnly believes in deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety and that the\ end crowns the deed
We will facilitate his task and lead him to the facile and ready course
But he ho is niggardly thinking he is self-sufficient and exercises greed
Denying the Day of Judgment and the requital that is commensurate with one’s deed
We will allow his course to what is miserable, unfavourable and bad
Nor will his material advantages save him from the infernal abode which is dark, troublesome and sad
It is We who indicate to the people what is right and what is wrong
And to Us indeed do the beginning and the end belong, for, one’s own self and all his possessions are not truly his own, but Ours
Therefore I have warned you people of a fiercely blazing fire
No one suffers it but the unfortunate who obstinately denies the truth and to arrogance does he aspire
Who whole heartedly denies Allah and deviates from the path of righteousness and piety
But saved from it will be the one who entertains the profound reverence dutiful to Allah and carries his reverence to Allah from contemplation to reality
Who spends of his wealth in benefaction
With no obligation to any, or expectation of a reward or a favour in return or a mundane satisfaction
But only on account of his interest, to please Allah, his Creator – the Supreme -, and to gain His welcome into His realm and be held precious in His esteem; a welcome featured by the illumination proceeding from Him and by the language spoken by His countenance
Such a person shall be rewarded to his satisfaction
By the forenoon
And by the night when life is reduced to quietness and darkness prevails and falls into a swoon
Allah your Creator, has not forsaken you nor does He dislike you or with you He is displeased
Indeed what awaits you in the Hereafter far excels all that you will experience here with all the gratification and happiness to be occasioned by future victory and satisfaction
And Allah, your Creator, shall bestow on you gratuitously what will meet with your expectation of blessing and benefaction
Did He not find you an orphan and He gave you shelter and care through your kinsman
Did He not find you unsettled and not freed from doubt and uncertainty and He guided you to the path of righteousness and filled your breast with reverential bliss
And did He not find you needy and He made you independent
Therefore, do not mistreat the orphan or humiliate
Nor be unkind to the one who addresses a petition to you, be it for
And express your gratitude by announcing Allah's bounty upon you and all grace abounding in you
Did We not solace you O Muhammad and make joyful your bosom (and make your spirit thirsty for knowledge, wisdom and spiritual light)
And did We not unload your burden of the heavy responsibility (by prompting you to feel drawn to it by invisible influence making you hug it to your heart and inducing you to lift to Us your inward sight)
A burden of an immense magnitude, We realize was more than your back could bear
And did We not praise your name to fame (that you are being mentioned by others with admiration, adoration and commendation)
In instances of hardship there is always included something of relief
Yes, indeed, with an instance of hardship there is always included something of relief
Therefore, when you are free of worldly duties, engage in worship and meditation
And make Allah your Creator, the heart of your purpose and the goal of contemplation
By the figs and the olives (might refer to Mt. of olives just outside the wall of AL-Quds (Jerusolem) where Isa (Jesus) was sent or to the parable of Allah's light) – see Y.Ali, note
And by Mount Sinai (where, Allah declared in words His Supreme Majesty to Mussa (Moses)
And by this town -Macca-, the haven which confers security (where you Muhammad were chosen for the final mission)
We created man in the best of shape and form and distinctly upright
Then We abased the proud to an inhabitant of the realm of Hell in requital of his ill-deeds
But not those who believed with hearts impressed with religious and spiritual virtues and deeds of wisdom and piety; these will have passed through nature to Eternity
And so, what then drives people in the light of all this to deny religion and deny judgment by Allah your Creator
Is Allah not the Most just of all judges Who will compensate those who were wronged in life and were oppressed and their grievances no one ever redressed
Read " That is to say
He created man from a clinging organism – See introduction
Read : and realize that Allah, your Creator is most generous
He taught by the pen, (the main instrument of learning and knowledge, the instrument of authorship)
He taught man what he did not know
But no, man always goes beyond the limits prescribed
He believes he is independent and not contingent or conditioned by anything else
But then it is to Allah, your Creator, shall the return be in the end
What do you think of the one who forbids
A votary, against praying and against religious observances
Is he -the infidel- O Muhammad acting on guidance steered by divine inspiration
Or he enjoins righteousness and piety
Do you see that he denies the truth and rejects the path of righteousness
Does he not know that Allah the Omnipresent sees him and every act whether in the very doing or on the point of being done
But no, if he does not desist We will grasp him and drag him by the forelock overhanging his forehead on a Day of unbroken gloom
A forehead that is false, pretending to be a forehead of divinity
And then let him call his associates
We will call the punitive angels
But no, do not yield to him, and bow to the ground to Allah in adoration and get closer to Him by supplication
We revealed it - the Quran - commencing at the highest esteemable Night (in the month of Ramadan -the month of fasting)
And you just do not know the meritorious standing of this Night of highest esteem
Deeds imprinted with wisdom and piety (like supplication, benevolence, pondering, acquirement of knowledge, at that night) merit a reward outweighing the reward due for like deeds accomplished for one thousand months
There, descend the angles and the Spirit Jibril (Gabriel) to discharge the duties ordained by Allah, the Supreme
Peace and blessings prevail until the break of dawn
Neither the unbelievers among Ahl AL-Kitab nor the idolaters were going to change their position until they have received clear divine evidence
Through A Messenger sent by Allah to read to them Scriptures of purity, quality and magnificence
With divine texts representing Allah's authoritative precepts featuring His words carrying greatest significance
But Ahl AL-Kitab only became divided after they had received this clear divine evidence
Yet they have been commanded to worship no one but Allah and Him alone to revere, and to be true exclusively to the Faith and renounce idolatry, to impel themselves to freedom from dissimulation and to be sincere and to observe prayers and pay alms- Such is the religion approved by Allah and its path leads mankind to wisdom and piety, and induces them to discharge the duties naturally owed to Him
The unbelievers among Ahl AL-Kitab and the idolaters are indeed the eternal dwellers of Hell; they are the worst among Allah's intellectual beings
But those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety are the best of the intellectual beings
There awaits them in Allah's realm the abode in the Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will have passed through nature to Eternity, Allah well pleased with them and they with Him; a reward commensurate with the equitable deeds achieved by him who has entertained the profound reverence dutiful to Allah, his Creator
When the earth, quakes, convulses and is violently shaken
And when it casts its burdensome contents of metals, corpses, bones and all that had been burned within
And mankind be struck with surprise and astonishment and emotionally vent an exclamation "What happened" they say, "to make the earth unstable and agitated
There and then will the earth tell her story, exposing everyone by his insignia, that of immorality and another of glory and another indicating reprimand
Featuring her obedience to Allah’s inspired command
There and then will people go forth assorted in groups of like attributes to be requited with what is commensurate with their deeds
Then he who has done an atom’s weight of good, will see it and profit by it
And he who has done an atom’s weight of evil, will see it and be punished for it
By the high- mettled horses when they breath hard or pant
And their hoofs emit sparks as they touch the rough terrain
En route to launch an attack on Allah's enemies at dawn
Raising clouds of dust
And assemble to penetrate into their midst to put them to rout with an effective thrust
That man is indeed ungrateful to Allah his Creator
And by his behavior he bears witness to this discord
How greedy he is for wealth, gains and health
Does he not know what happens when the graves eject their contents
And all that was hidden in the peoples’ chests become personified and manifest
And that this is the Day their Creator reveals to them secrets He knows; which secrets they had long forgotten
The Big Event of the violent collision of all celestial bodies
How pounding is that collision
You just do not know what is like this violent collision
People will be like moths scattered about
And the mountains will be like flakes of wool carded out
Then he whose scales are tipped in favour of deeds of wisdom and piety
He will live a life of bliss in the exalted and blissful society
But he whose good works are light in weight and below par
Will be fostered by the deep bottomless abyss
And you just do not know what it is like in the abyss
It is the blazing infernal pit expressing fury with a crackle and a hiss
Multiplicity of the good things in life between wealth, conveniences and progeny divert your attention
Until the graves become your house of detention
There and then will you come to know all that is in conformity with truth and verity
But indeed you will come to know what is in accordance with fact and reality
No, but if only you knew the reality of what awaits those whose actions and dispositions do not accord with the divine standard, you would not succumb to illusions
For you will see the Hell fire awaiting the unjust who failed to reason their own conclusions
And you will see it with the eye of certainty
There and then shall you be asked of how you used the fruits of the years you received to your comfort and to your enjoyment and content, and how you exercised your faculties divine with which Allah had endowed you and to what extent
By the era distinctive of life on earth
Man suffers loss through negligence and misadventure and what his ambition is worth
Except those whose hearts reflect the image of religious and spiritual virtues and their deeds wisdom and piety, who commended adherence to what is in conformity with truth and accords with reality and promoted the virtue of patience in their society
Woe to every scandal-monger who thrives on traducing people
Who amasses money and multiplies it for the sake of accumulating wealth whereof reckoning it numerically gives him pleasure
He thinks that his fortune will immortalize him forever
Never, but he and all that he amassed will be cast into the Hutama, a fiercely merciless fire
You just do not know what the Hutama is like
It is the infernal pit of Hell fire ordained by Allah
Which fire finds its way to the innermost being of thoughts and desire
It is vaulted over the wicked
In lengths of columned extended tubes
Did you not see into or ponder O Muhammad how Allah your Creator, dealt with the expedition which included the elephant in their train
Did He not make their strategy as well as tactics simply vain
He overwhelmed them with throngs of birds coming in very large flights
Striking them with clay stones, spreading among them an epidemic
Until they became like the stubbles left over in a field that has been reaped
The union of the people of Qoraish into one whole body
And the safety of their customary trade journeys winter and summer
Are owed to Allah, the Sovereign of this Sanctuary -AL-Ka’ba- Whom they should worship, and Him alone they should adore
He saved them from hunger and gave them the security they longed for
Do you see the one who denies religion and does not recognize Allah nor His control and government of all events
Such is he who ill-treats the orphan
And discourages aid to the indigent faint soul past corporal toil
And so, Woe to those who make great pretences to religion and their hearts' ears to exhortation are not inclined
Who are oblivious of their act of worship, and when they perform it, their countenances reflect and speak absence of mind
Who cultivate pretence and they, themselves, are empty of all good
Their malevolence prevents benevolence and proves an occasion of so much discontent
We have bestowed on you O Muhammad AL-Kawther which is the abundance of good things. We favoured you with a good many blessings of magnificence and imposing magnitude here and Hereafter including knowledge, wisdom, distinction, followers, immunity, fame and insight
In return, perform your prayer first, then execute the sacrifice whose meat you distribute among the needy till benevolence has had its rite
As to your enemy who bore malice to you; it is he and not you who shall he cut off all hope and posterity and drown in shame. He will be denied the praise of his name to fame
Say O Muhammad to those who have rejected Faith: "O you infidels
I do not worship the idols which you worship
Nor do you worship Allah, Whom I worship
Nor do I observe your religious rites, but I observe what accords with fact and reason and with what is logically sound
Nor do you observe Allah’s ordinances or such advice as Allah inclines you to propound
You have your religion and I have mine
When Allah's help and victory come to pass and the gates of Macca are declared open to you O Muhammad
And you see the people embracing Allah’s system of faith and worship in great numbers
Then praise Allah, your Creator, and extoll His attributes and accord, and invoke His forgiveness and concord, for indeed, He always accepts repentance and the atonements made by the people
Perish the hands of Abu Lahab, (the instruments of his cruel actions against those who recognized Allah) and likewise perish he
Neither his wealth nor all his gains will save him from what awaits him of retributive punishment
He shall suffer the blazing fire which emits mountainous flames
Along with his slanderous wife who carried bundles of thorny wood (and laid them in the Prophet’s path to cause him bodily injury and to render his mission vain)
She shall be necklaced with a similar twisted rope to double her torment and augment her pain
Say O Muhammad: "He is Allah and He is One
He is Infinite, Absolute, and all creatures, spiritual, animate and inanimate, are in need of Him while He is in need of no one
He did not beget nor was He begotten
And like unto Him there is none
Say: "I commit myself to Allah the Creator of the dawn and the incipient gleam
Counter to the evil generated by the spiritual, the animate and the inanimate among those created by Him, the Supreme
And counter to an evil process evolving under the umbrella of the night" or "to a heavenly body " if it happens to explode within or beyond one’s sight
And counter to the evil generated by the witches who stand in the way of concord and blow over entangled knots to fan the flow of discord
And counter to the evil generated by the envious when he feels envy at the superior advantages of others
Say: "I commit myself to Allah, the Creator and Master of mankind
The Sovereign Supreme of mankind
The Ilah of Mankind
Counter to the evil generated by the sneak whisperer and by his confederates, and by those with characteristics befitting Al-Shaytan (Satan) separately or combined
Who instigate evil in peoples’ repositories of consciousness and suggest it secretly to the thoughts and the feeling and to the religious mind
Of the people among the. Jinn and mankind
