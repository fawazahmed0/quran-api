In the name of the most merciful God
Praise be to God, the Lord of all creatures
the most merciful
the king of the day of judgment
Thee do we worship, and of Thee do we beg assistance
Direct us in the right way
in the way of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; not of those against whom Thou art incensed, nor of those who go astray
M
There is no doubt in this book; it is a direction to the pious
who believe in the mysteries of faith, who observe the appointed times of prayer, and distribute alms out of what We have bestowed on them
and who believe in that revelation, which hath been sent down unto thee, and that which hath been sent down unto the prophets before thee, and have firm assurance in the life to come
these are directed by their Lord, and they shall prosper
As for the unbelievers, it will be equal to them whether thou admonish them, or do not admonish them; they will not believe
God hath sealed up their hearts and their hearing; a dimness covereth their sight, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment
There are some who say, We believe in God, and the last day; but are not really believers
they seek to deceive God, and those who do believe, but they deceive themselves only, and are not sensible thereof
There is an infirmity in their hearts, and God hath increased that infirmity; and they shall suffer a most painful punishment, because they have disbelieved
When one saith unto them, act not corruptly in the earth; they reply, Verily we are men of integrity
Are not they themselves corrupt doers? But they are not sensible thereof
And when one saith unto them, believe ye as others believe; they answer, shall we believe as fools believe? Are not they themselves fools? But they know it not
When they meet those who believe, they say, we do believe: But when they retire privately to their devils, they say, we really hold with you, and only mock at those people
God shall mock at them, and continue them in their impiety; they shall wander in confusion
These are the men who have purchased error at the price of true direction: But their traffick hath not been gainful, neither have they been rightly directed
They are like unto one who kindleth a fire, and when it hath enlightened all around him; God taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness, they shall not see
they are deaf, dumb, and blind, therefore will they not repent
Or like a stormy cloud from heaven, fraught with darkness, thunder, and lightning, they put their fingers in their ears, because of the noise of the thunder, for fear of death; God encompasseth the infidels
the lightning wanteth but little of taking away their sight; so often as it enlighteneth them, they walk therein, but when darkness cometh on them, they stand still; and if God so pleased, he would certainly deprive them of their hearing and their sight, for God is almighty
O men of Mecca serve your Lord who hath created you, and those who have been before you peradventure ye will fear Him
who hath spread the earth as a bed for you, and the heaven as a covering, and hath caused water to descend from heaven, and thereby produced fruits for your sustenance. Set not up therefore any equals unto God, against your own knowledge
If ye be in doubt concerning that revelation which We have sent down unto our servant, produce a chapter like unto it, and call upon your witnesses, besides God, if ye say truth
But if ye do it not, nor shall ever be able to do it; justly fear the fire whose fewel is men and stones, prepared for the unbeliebers
But bear good tidings unto those who believe, and do good works, that they shall have gardens watered by rivers; so often as they eat of the fruit thereof for sustenance, they shall say, this is what we have formerly eaten of; and they shall be supplied with several sorts of fruit having a mutual resemblance to one another. There shall they enjoy wives subject to no impurity, and there shall they continue for ever
Moreover God will not be ashamed to propound in a parable a gnat, or even a more despicable thing; for they who believe will know it to be the truth from their Lord; but the unbelievers will say, What meaneth God by this parable? He will thereby mislead many, and will direct many thereby: but He will not mislead any thereby, except the transgressors
who make void the covenant of God after the establishing thereof, and cut in sunder that which God hath commanded to be joined, and act corruptly in the earth; they shall perish
How is it that ye believe not in God? Since ye were dead, and He gave you life; He will hereafter cause you to die, and will again restore you to life; then shall ye return unto Him
It is He who hath created for you whatsoever is on earth, and then set his mind to the creation of heaven, and formed it into seven heavens; He knoweth all things
When thy Lord said unto the angels, I am going to place a substitute on earth; they said, Wilt thou place there one who will do evil therein, and shed blood? But we celebrate thy praise, and sanctify Thee. God answered, verily I know that which ye know not
and He taught Adam the names of all things, and then proposed them to the angels, and said, declare unto Me the names of these things if ye say truth
They answered, praise be unto thee, we have no knowledge but what Thou teachest us, for Thou art knowing and wise
God said, O Adam, tell them their names. And when he had told them their names, God said, did I not tell you that I know the secrets of heaven and earth, and know that which ye discover, and that which ye conceal
And when We said unto the angels, worship Adam; they all worshipped him, except Eblis who refused, and was puffed up with pride, and became of the number of unbelievers
And We said, O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in the garden, and eat of the fruit thereof plentifully wherever ye will; but approach not this tree, lest ye become of the number of the transgressors
But Satan caused them to forfeit paradise, and turned them out of the state of happiness wherein they had been; whereupon We said, get ye down, the one of you an enemy unto the other, and there shall be a dwelling place for you in earth, and a provision for a season
And Adam learned words of prayer from his Lord, and God turned unto him, for He is easy to be reconciled and merciful
We said, get ye all down from hence; hereafter shall there come unto you a direction from me, and whoever shall follow my direction, on them shall no fear come, neither shall they be grieved
but they who shall be unbelievers, and accuse our signs of falsehood, they shall be the companions of hell fire, therein shall they remain for ever
O children of Israel, remember my favour wherewith I have favoured you; and perform your covenant with me, and I will perform my covenant with you; and revere me
and believe in the revelation which I have sent down, confirming that which is with you, and be not the first who believe not therein, neither exchange my signs for a small price; and fear me
Cloath not the truth with vanity, neither conceal the truth against your own knowledge
observe the stated times of prayer, and pay your legal alms, and bow down yourselves with those who bow down
Will ye command men to do justice, and forget your own souls? Yet ye read the book of the law: Do ye not therefore understand
Ask help with perseverance and prayer; this indeed is grievous, unless to the humble
who seriously think they shall meet their Lord, and that to Him they shall return
O children of Israel, remember my favour wherewith I have favoured you, and that I have preferred you above all nations
Dread the day wherein one soul shall not make satisfaction for another soul, neither shall any intercession be accepted from them, nor shall any compensation be received, neither shall they be helped
Remember when we delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who grievously oppressed you, they slew your male children, and let your females live: Therein was a great trial from your Lord
And when we divided the sea for you and delivered you, and drowned Pharaoh's people while ye looked on
And when we treated with Moses forty nights; then ye took the calf for your God, and did evil
yet afterwards we forgave you, that preadventure ye might give thanks
And when we gave Moses the book of the law, and the distinction between good and evil, that peradventure ye might be directed
And when Moses said unto his people, O my people, verily ye have injured your own souls, by your taking the calf for your God; therefore be turned unto your Creator, and slay those among you who have been guilty of that crime; this will be better for you in the sight of your Creator; and thereupon He turned unto you, for He is easy to be reconciled, and merciful
And when ye said, O Moses, we will not believe thee, untill we see God manifestly; therefore a punishment came upon you, while ye looked on
then we raised you to life after ye had been dead, that peradventure ye might give thanks
And We caused clouds to overshadow you, and manna and quails to descend upon you, saying, eat of the food things which We have given you for food: And they injured not Us, but injured their own souls
And when We said, enter into this city, and eat of the provisions thereof plentifully as ye will; and enter the gate worshipping, and say, forgiveness! We will pardon you your sins, and give increase unto the well-doers
But the ungodly changed the expression into another, different from what had been spoken unto them; and we sent down upon the ungodly indignation from heaven, because they had transgressed
And when Moses asked drink for his people, We said, strike the rock with thy rod; and there gushed thereout twelve fountains according to the number of the tribes, and all men knew their respective drinking-place. Eat and drink of the bounty of God, and commit not evil in the earth, acting unjustly
And when ye said, O Moses, we will by no means be satisfied with one kind of food; pray unto thy Lord therefore for us, that He would produce for us of that which the earth bringeth forth, herbs, and cucumbers, and garlick, and lentils, and onions; Moses answered, will ye exchange that which is better, for that which is worse? Get ye down in Egypt, for there shall ye find what ye desire: And they were smitten with vileness and misery, and drew on themselves indignation from God. This they suffered, because they believed not in the signs of God, and killed the prophets unjustly; this, because they rebelled and transgressed
Surely those who believe, and those who Judaize, and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believeth in God, and the last day, and doth that which is right, they shall have their reward with their Lord, there shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
Call to mind also when we accepted your covenant, and lifted up the mountain of Sinai over you, saying, receive the law which we have given you, with a resolution to keep it, and remember that which is contained therein, that ye may beware
After this ye again turned back, so that if it had not been for God's indulgence and mercy towards you, ye had certainly been destroyed
Moreover ye know what befall those of your nation who transgressed on the sabbath day; we said unto them, be ye changed into apes, driven away from the society of men
And we made them an example unto those who were contemporary with them, and unto those who came after them, and a warning to the pious
And when Moses said unto his people, verily God commandeth you to sacrifice a cow; they answered, dost thou make a jest of us? Moses said, God fobid that I should be one of the foolish
They said, pray for us unto thy Lord, that He would shew us what cow it is. Moses answered, he saith, she is neither an old cow, nor a young heifer, but of a middle age between both: Do ye therefore that which ye are commanded
They said, pray for us unto thy Lord that he would shew us what colour she is of. Moses answered, he saith, she is a red cow, intensely red, her colour rejoiceth the beholders
They said, pray for us unto thy Lord, that He would further shew us what cow it is, for several cows with us are like one another, and we, if God please, will be directed
Moses answered, he saith, she is a cow not broken to plough the earth, or water the field, a found one, there is no blemish in her. They said, now hast thou brought the truth. Then they sacrificed her; yet they wanted but little of leaving it undone
And when ye slew a man, and contended among your selves concerning him, God brought forth to light that which ye concealed
For we said, strike the dead body with part of the sacrificed cow: So God raiseth the dead to life, and sheweth you his signs, that peradventure ye may understand
Then were your hearts hardened after this, even as stones, or exceeding them in hardness: For from some stones have rivers bursted forth, others have been rent in sunder, and water hath issued from them, and others have fallen down for fear of God. But God is not regardless of that which ye do
Do ye therefore desire that the Jews should believe you? Yet a part of them heard the word of God, and then perverted it, after they had understood it, against their own conscience
And when they meet the true believers, they say, we believe: But when they are privately assembled together, they say, will ye acquaint them with what God hath revealed unto you, that they may dispute with you concerning it in the presence of your Lord? Do ye not therefore understand
Do not they know that God knoweth that which they conceal as well as that which they publish
But there are illiterate men among them, who know not the book of the law, but only lying stories, although they think otherwise
And woe unto them who transcribe corruptly the book of the law with their hands, and then say, this is from God: That they may sell it for a small price. Therefore woe unto them because of that which their hands have written; and woe unto them for that which they have gained
They say, the fire of hell shall not touch us but for a certain number of days. Answer, have ye received any promise from God to that purpose? For God will not act contrary to his promise: Or do ye speak concerning God that which ye know not
Verily who so doth evil, and is encompassed by his iniquity, they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall remain therein for ever
But they who believe and do good works, they shall be the companions of paradise, they shall continue therein for ever
Remember also, when We accepted the covenant of the children of Israel, saying, ye shall not worship any other except God, and ye shall shew kindness to your parents and kindred, and to orphans, and to the poor, and speak that which is good unto men; and be constant at prayer, and give alms. Afterwards ye turned back, except a few of you, and retired afar off
And when We accepted your covenant, saying, ye shall not shed your brothers blood, nor dispossess one another of your habitations. Then ye confirmed it, and were witnesses thereto
Afterwards ye were they who slew one another, and turned several of your brethren out of their houses, mutually assisting each other against them with injustice and enmity; but if they come captives unto you, ye redeem them: Yet it is equally unlawful for you to dispossess them. Do ye therefore believe in part of the book of the law, and reject other part thereof? But whoso among you doth this, shall have no other reward than shame in this life, and on the day of resurrection they shall be sent to a most grievous punishment; for God is not regardless of that which ye do
These are they who have purchased this present life, at the price of that which is to come; wherefore their punishment shall not be mitigated, neither shall they be helped
We formerly delivered the book of the law unto Moses, and caused Apostles to succeed him, and gave evident miracles to Jesus the son of Mary, and strengthened him with the holy spirit. Do ye therefore, whenever an Apostle cometh unto you with that which your souls desire not, proudly reject him, and accuse some of imposture, and slay others
The Jews say, our hearts are uncircumcised: But God hath cursed them with their infidelity, therefore few shall believe
And when a book came unto them from God, confirming the scriptures which were with them, although they had before prayed for assistance against those who believed not, yet when that came unto them which they knew to be from God, they would not believe therein: therefore the curse of God shall be on the infidels
For a vile price have they sold their souls, that they should not believe in that which God hath sent down; out of envy, because God sendeth down his favours to such of his servants as he pleaseth: Therefore they brought on themselves indignation on indignation; and the unbelievers shall suffer an ignominious punishment
When one saith unto them, believe in that which God hath sent down; they answer, we believe in that which hath been sent down unto us: And they reject what hath been revealed since, although it be the truth, confirming that which is with them. Say, why therefore have ye slain the prophets of God in times past, if ye be true believers
Moses formerly came unto you with evident signs, but ye afterwards took the calf for your god and did wickedly
And when we accepted your covenant and lifted the mountain of Sinai over you, saying, receive the law which we have given you, with a resolution to perform it, and hear; they said, we have heard, and have rebelled: And they were made to drink down the calf into their hearts for their unbelief. Say, a grievous thing hath your faith commanded you, if ye be true believers
Say, if the future mansion with God be prepared peculiarly for you, exclusive of the rest of mankind, wish for death, if ye say truth
But they will never wish for it, because of that which their hands have sent before them; God knoweth the wicked doers
and thou shalt surely find them of all men the most covetous of life, even more than the idolaters: One of them would desire his life to be prolonged a thousand years, but none shall reprieve himself from punishment, that his life may be prolonged: God seeth that which they do
Say, whoever is an enemy to Gabriel -- for he hath caused the Koran to descend on thy heart, by the permission of God, confirming that which was before revealed, a direction, and good tidings to the faithful
whosoever is an enemy to God, or his angels, or his Apostles, or to Gabriel, or Michael, verily God is an enemy to the unbelievers
And now we have sent down unto thee evident signs, and none will disbelieve them but the evil-doers
Whenever they make a covenant, will some of them reject it? Yea the greater part of them do not believe
And when there came unto them an Apostle from God, confirming that scripture which was with them, some of those to whom the scriptures were given, cast the book of God behind their backs, as if they knew it not
And they followed the device which the devils devised against the kingdom of Solomon; and Solomon was not an unbeliever; but the devils believed not, they taught men sorcery, and that which was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut: Yet those two taught no man until they had said, verily we are a temptation, therefore be not an unbeliever. So men learned from those two a charm by which they might cause division between a man and his wife; but they hurt none thereby, unless by God's permission; and they learned that which would hurt them, and not profit them; and yet they knew that he who bought that art should have no part in the life to come, and woful is the price for which they have sold their souls, if they knew it
But if they had believed, and feared God, verily the reward they would have had from God, would have been better, if they had known it
O true believers, say not to our Apostle, Raina; but say Ondhorna; and hearken: The infidels shall suffer a grievous punishment
It is not the desire of the unbelievers, either among those unto whom the scriptures have been given, or among the idolaters, that any good should be sent down unto you from your Lord: But God will appropriate his mercy unto whom he pleaseth; for God is exceeding beneficent
Whatever verse we shall abrogate, or cause thee to forget, we will bring a better than it, or one like unto it. Dost thou not know that God is almighty
Dost thou not know that unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth? Neither have ye any protector or helper except God
Will ye require of your Apostle according to that which was formerly required of Moses? But he that hath exchanged faith for infidelity, hath already erred from the strait way
Many of those unto whom the scriptures have been given, desire to render you again unbelievers, after ye have believed; out of envy from their souls, even after the truth is become manifest unto them; but forgive them, and avoid them, till God shall send his command; for God is omnipotent
Be constant in prayer, and give alms; and what good ye have sent before for your souls, ye shall find it with God; surely God seeth that which ye do
They say, verily none shall enter paradise, except they who are Jews or Christians: This is their wish. Say, produce your proof of this, if ye speak truth
Nay, but he who resigneth himself to God, and doth that which is right, he shall have his reward with his Lord; there shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
The Jews say, the Christians are grounded on nothing; and the Christians say, the Jews are grounded on nothing: Yet they both read the scriptures. So likewise say they who know not the scripture, according to their saying. But God shall judge between them on the day of the resurrection, concerning that about which they now disagree
Who is more unjust than he who prohibiteth the temples of God, that his name should be remembered therin, and who hasteth to destroy them? Those men cannot enter therein, but with fear: They shall have shame in this world, and in the next a grievous punishment
To God belongeth the east and the west; therefore whithersoever ye turn your selves to pray, there is the face of God; for God is omnipresent and omniscient
They say, God hath begotten children: God forbid! To him belongeth whatever is in heaven, and on earth; all is possessed by him
the creator of heaven and earth; and when he decreeth a thing, he only saith unto it, be, and it is
And they who know not the scriptures say, unless God speak unto us, or thou shew us a sign, we will not believe. So said those before them, according to their saying: Their hearts resemble each other. We have already shewn manifest signs unto people who firmly believe
we have sent thee in truth, a bearer of good tidings, and a preacher; and thou shalt not be questioned concerning the companions of hell
But the Jews will not be pleased with thee, neither the Christians, until thou follow their religion; say, the direction of God is the true direction. And verily if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, thou shalt find no patron or protector against God
They to whom we have given the book of the Koran, and who read it with its true reading, they believe therein; and whoever believeth not therein, they shall perish
O children of Israel, remember my favour wherewith I have favoured you, and that I have preferred you before all nations
and dread the day wherein one soul shall not make satisfaction for another soul, neither shall any compensation be accepted from them, nor shall any intercession avail, neither shall they be helped
Remember when the Lord tried Abraham by certain words, which he fulfilled: God said, verily I will constitute thee a model of religion unto mankind; he answered, and also of my posterity; God said, my covenant doth not comprehend the ungodly
And when we appointed the holy house of Mecca to be a place of resort for mankind, and a place of security; and said, take the station of Abraham for a place of prayer; and we covenanted with Abraham and Ismael, that they should cleanse my house for those who should compass it, and those who should be devoutly assiduous there, and those who should bow down and worship
And when Abraham said, Lord, make this a territory of security, and bounteously bestow fruits on its inhabitants, such of them as believe in God and the last day; God answered, and whoever believeth not, I will bestow on him little, afterwards I will drive him to the punishment of hellfire; an ill journey shall it be
And when Abraham and Ismael raised the foundations of the house, saying, Lord, accept it from us, for thou art he who heareth and knoweth
Lord, make us also resigned unto thee, and of our posterity a people resigned unto thee, and shew us our holy ceremonies, and be turned unto us, for thou art easy to be reconciled, and merciful
Lord, send them likewise an Apostle from among them, who may declare thy signs unto them, and teach them the book of the Koran and wisdom, and may purify them; for thou art mighty and wise
Who will be averse to the religion of Abraham, but he whose mind is infatuated? Surely we have chosen him in this world, and in that which is to come he shall be one of the righteous
When his Lord said unto him, resign thy self unto me; he answered, I have resigned my self unto the Lord of all creatures
And Abraham bequeathed this religion to his children, and Jacob did the same, saying, my children, verily God hath chosen this religion for you, therefore die not, unless ye also be resigned
Were ye present when Jacob was at the point of death? When he said to his sons, whom will ye worship after me? They answered, we will worship thy God, and the God of thy fathers Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, one God, and to him will we be resigned
That people are now passed away, they have what they have gained, and ye shall have what ye gain; and ye shall not be questioned concerning that which they have done
They say, become Jews or Christians that ye may be directed. Say, nay, we follow the religion of Abraham the orthodox, who was no idolater
Say, we believe in God, and that which hath been sent down unto us, and that which hath been sent down unto Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which was delivered unto Moses, and Jesus, and that which was delivered unto the prophets from their Lord: We make no distinction between any of them, and to God are we resigned
Now if they believe according to what ye believe, they are surely directed, but if they turn back, they are in schism. God shall support thee against them, for he is the hearer, the wise
The baptism of God have we received, and who it better than God to baptize? Him do we worship
Say, will ye dispute with us concernig God, who is our Lord, and your Lord? We have our works, and ye have your works, and unto him are we sincerely devoted
Will ye say, truly Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, are ye wiser, or God? And who is more unjust than he who hideth the testimony which he hath received from God? But God is not regardless of that which ye do
That people are passed away, they have what they have gained, and ye shall have what ye gain, nor shall ye be questioned concerning that which they have done
The foolish men will say, what hath turned them from their Keblah, towards which they formerly prayed? Say, unto God belongeth the east and the west: He directeth whom he pleaseth into the right way
Thus have we placed you, O Arabians, an intermediate nation, that ye may be witnesses against the rest of mankind, and that the Apostle may be a witness against you. We appointed the Keblah towards which thou didst formerly pray, only that we might know him who followeth the Apostle, from him who turneth back on his heel; though this change seem a great matter, unless unto those whom God hath directed. But God will not render your faith of none effect; for God is gracious and merciful unto man
We have seen thee turn about thy face towards heaven with uncertainty, but we will cause thee to turn thy self towards a Keblah that will please thee. Turn therefore thy face towards the holy temple of Mecca; and wherever ye be, turn your faces towards that place. They to whom the scripture hath been given, know this to be truth from their Lord. God is not regardless of that which ye do
Verily although thou shouldest shew unto those to whom the scripture hath been given, all kinds of signs, yet they will not follow thy Keblah, neither shalt thou follow their Keblah; nor will one part of them follow the Keblah of the other. And if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, verily thou wilt become one of the ungodly
They to whom we have given the scripture know our apostle, even as they know their own children; but some of them hide the truth, against their own knowledge
Truth is from thy Lord, therefore thou shalt not doubt
Every sect hath a certain tract of heaven to which they turn themselves in prayer; but for ye strive to run after good things: Wherever ye be, God will bring you all back at the resurrection, for God is almighty
And from what place soever thou comest forth, turn thy face towards the holy temple; for this is truth from thy Lord; neither is God regardless of that which ye do
From what place soever thou comest forth, turn thy face towards the holy temple; and wherever ye be, thitherward turn your faces, lest men have matter of dispute against you; but as for those among them who are unjust doers, fear them not, but fear me, that I may accomplish my grace upon you, and that ye may be directed
As we have sent unto you an apostle from among you, to rehearse our signs unto you, and to purify you, and to teach you the book of the Koran and wisdom, and to teach you that which ye knew not
Therefore remember me, and I will remember you, and give thanks unto me, and be not unbelievers
O true believers, beg assistance with patience and prayer, for God is with the patient
And say not of those who are slain in fight for the religion of God, that they are dead; yea, they are living: But ye do not understand
We will surely prove you by afflicting you in some measure with fear, and hunger, and decrease of wealth, and loss of lives, and scarcity of fruits: But bear good tidings unto the patient
who when a misfortune befalleth them, say, we are God's, and unto him shall we surely return
Upon them shall be blessings from their Lord and mercy, and they are the rightly directed
Moreover Safa and Merwah are two of the monuments of God: Whoever therefore goeth on pilgrimage to the temple of Mecca or visiteth it, it shall be no crime in him if he compass them both. And as for him who voluntarily performeth a good work; verily God is grateful and knowing
They who conceal any of the evident signs, or the direction which we have sent down, after what we have manifested unto men in the scripture, God shall curse them; and they who curse shall curse them
But as for those who repent and amend, and make known what they concealed, I will be turned unto them, for I am easy to be reconciled and merciful
Surely they who believe not, and die in their unbelief, upon them shall be the curse of God, and of the angels, and of all men
they shall remain under it for ever, their punishment shall not be alleviated, neither shall they be regarded
Your God is one God, there is no God but He, the most merciful
Now in the creation of heaven and earth, and the vicissitude of night and day, and in the ship which saileth in the sea, loaden with what is profitable for mankind, and in the rain water which God sendeth from heaven, quickening thereby the dead earth, and replenishing the same with all sorts of cattle, and in the change of winds, and the clouds that are compelled to do service between heaven and earth, are signs to people of understanding
Yet some men take idols beside God, and love them as with the love due to God; but the true believers are more fervent in love towards God. Oh that they who act unjustly did perceive, when they behold their punishment, that all power belongeth unto God, and that he is severe in punishing
When those who have been followed, shall separate themselves from their followers, and shall see the punishment, and the cords of relation between them shall be cut in sunder
the followers shall say, if we could return to life, we would separate our selves from them, as they have now separated themselves from us. So God will shew them their works; they shall sigh grievously and shall not come forth from the fire of hell
O men, eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth; and tread not in the steps of the devil, for he is your open enemy
Verily he commandeth you evil and wickedness, and that ye should say that of God which ye know not
And when it is said unto them who believe not, follow that which God hath sent down; they answer, nay, but we will follow that which we found our fathers practise. What? Though their fathers knew nothing, and were not rightly directed
The unbelievers are like unto one who crieth aloud to that which heareth not so much as his calling, or the sound of his voice. They are deaf, dumb, and blind, therefore do they not understand
O true believers, eat of the good things which we have bestowed on you for food, and return thanks unto God, if ye serve him
Verily he hath forbidden you to eat that which dieth of itself, and blood, and swine's flesh, and that on which any other name but God's hath been invocated. But he who is forced by necessity, not lusting, nor returning to transgress, it shall be no crime in him if he eat of those things, for God is gracious and merciful
Moreover they who conceal any part of the scripture which God hath sent down unto them, and sell it for a small price, they shall swallow into their bellies nothing but fire; God shall not speak unto them on the day of resurrection, neither shall he purify them, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment
These are they who have sold direction for error, and pardon for punishment: But how great will their suffering be in the fire
This they shall endure, because God sent down the book of the Koran with truth, and they who disagree concerning that book, are certainly in a wide mistake
It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces in prayer towards the east and the west, but righteousness is of him who believeth in God and the last day, and the angels, and the scriptures, and the prophets; who giveth money for God's sake unto his kindred, and unto orphans, and the needy, and the stranger, and those who ask, and for redemption of captives; who is constant at prayer, and giveth alms; and of those who perform their covenant, when they have covenanted, and who behave themselves patiently in adversity, and hardships, and in time of violence: These are they who are true, and these are they who fear God
O true believers, the law of retaliation is ordained you for the slain: The free shall die for the free, and the servant for the servant, and a woman for a woman: But he whom his brother shall forgive, may be prosecuted, and obliged to make satisfaction according to what is just, and a fine shall be set on him with humanity. This is indulgence from your Lord, and mercy. And he who shall transgress after this, by killing the murderer, shall suffer a grievous punishment
And in this law of retaliation ye have life, O ye of understanding, that peradventure ye may fear
It is ordained you, when any of you is at the point of death, if he leave any goods, that he bequeath a legacy to his parents, and kindred, according to what shall be reasonable. This is a duty incumbent on those who fear God
But he who shall change the legacy, after he hath heard it bequeathed by the dying person, surely the sin thereof shall be on those who change it, for God is he who heareth and knoweth
Howbeit he who apprehendeth from the testator any mistake or injustice, and shall compose the matter between them, that shall be no crime in him, for God is gracious and merciful
O true believers, a fast is ordained you, as it was ordained unto those before you, that ye may fear God
A certain number of days shall ye fast: But he among you who shall be sick, or on a journey, shall fast an equal number of other days. And those who can keep it, and do not, must redeem their neglect by maintaining of a poor man. And he who voluntarily dealeth better with the poor man than he is obliged, this shall be better for him. But if ye fast it will be better for you, if ye knew it
The month of Ramadan shall ye fast, in which the Koran was sent down from heaven, a direction unto men, and declarations of direction, and the distinction between good and evil. Therefore let him among you who shall be present in this month, fast the same month; but he who shall be sick, or on a journey, shall fast the like number of other days. God would make this an ease unto you, and would not make it a difficulty unto you; that ye may fulfill the number of days, and glorify God, for that he hath directed you, and that ye may give thanks
When my servants ask thee concerning me, verily I am near; I will hear the prayer of him that prayeth, when he prayeth unto me: But let them hearken unto me, and believe in me, that they may be rightly directed
It is lawful for you on the night of the fast to go in unto your wives; they are a garment unto you, and ye are a garment unto them. God knoweth that ye defraud your selves therein, wherefore he turneth unto you, and forgiveth you. Now therefore go in unto them; and earnestly desire that which God ordaineth you, and eat and drink until ye can plainly distinguish a white thread from a black thread by the day-break: Then keep the fast until night, and go not in unto them, but be constantly present in the places of worship. These are the prescribed bounds of God, therefore draw not near them to transgress them. Thus God declareth his signs unto men, that they may fear him
Consume not your wealth among your selves in vain; nor present it unto judges, that ye may devour part of men's substance unjustly, against your own consciences
They will ask thee concerning the phases of the moon: Answer, they are times appointed unto men, and to shew the season of the pilgrimage to Mecca. It is not righteousness that ye enter your houses by the back parts thereof, but righteousness is of him who feareth God. Therefore enter your houses by their doors; and fear God, that ye may be happy
And fight for the religion of God against those who fight against you, but transgress not by attacking them first, for God loveth not the transgressors
And kill them wherever ye find them, and turn them out of that whereof they have dispossessed you, for temptation to idolatry is more grievous than slaughter: Yet fight not against them in the holy temple, until they attack you therein; but if they attack you, slay them there. This shall be the reward of the infidels
But if they desist, God is gracious and merciful
Fight therefore against them, until there be no temptation to idolatry, and the religion be God's: But if they desist, then let there be no hostility, except against the ungodly
A sacred month for a sacred month, and the holy limits of Mecca, if they attack you therein, do ye also attack them therein in retaliation; and whoever transgresseth against you by so doing, do ye transgress against him in like manner as he hath transgressed against you, and fear God, and know that God is with those who fear him
Contribute out of your substance toward the defence of the religion of God, and throw not your selves with your own hands into perdition; and do good, for God loveth those who do good
Perform the pilgrimage of Mecca, and the visitation of God: And if ye be besieged, send that offering which shall be the easiest; and shave not your heads, until your offering reacheth the place of sacrifice. But whoever among you is sick, or is troubled with any distemper of the head, must redeem the shaving his head by fasting, or alms, or some offering. When ye are secure from enemies, he who tarrieth in the visitation of the temple of Mecca until the pilgrimage, shall bring that offering which shall be the easiest. But he who findeth not any thing to offer, shall fast three days in the pilgrimage, and seven when ye are returned: They shall be ten days complete. This is incumbent on him, whose family shall not be present at the holy temple. And fear God and know that God is severe in punishing
The pilgrimage must be performed in the known months; whosoever therefore purposeth to go on pilgrimage therein, let him not know a woman, nor transgress, nor quarrel in the pilgrimage. The good which ye do, God knoweth it. Make provision for your journey; but the best provision is piety: And fear me, O ye of understanding
It shall be no crime in you, if ye seek an increase from your Lord, by trading during the pilgrimage. And when ye go in procession from Arafat, remember God near the holy monument; and remember him for that he hath directed you, although ye were before this of the number of those who go astray
Therefore go in procession from whence the people go in procession, and ask pardon of God, for God is gracious and merciful
And when ye have finished your holy ceremonies, remember God, according as ye remember your fathers, or with a more reverend commemoration. There are some men who say, O Lord, give us our portion in this world; but such shall have no portion in the next life
And there are others who say, O Lord, give us good in this world, and also good in the next world, and deliver us from the torment of hell fire
They shall have a portion of that which they have gained: God is swift in taking an account
Remember God the appointed number of days: But if any haste to depart from the valley of Mina in two days, it shall be no crime in him. And if any tarry longer, it shall be no crime in him, in him who feareth God. Therefore fear God, and know that unto him ye shall be gathered
There is a man who causeth thee to marvel by his speech concerning this present life, and calleth God to witness that which is in his heart, yet he is most intent in opposing thee
and when he turneth away from thee, he hasteth to act corruptly in the earth, and to destroy that which is sown, and springeth up: But God loveth not corrupt doing
And if one say unto him, fear God; pride seizeth him, together with wickedness; but hell shall be his reward, and an unhappy couch shall it be
There is also a man who selleth his soul for the sake of those things which are pleasing unto God; and God is gracious unto his servants
O true believers, enter into the true religion wholly, and follow not the steps of Satan, for he is your open enemy
If ye have slipped after the declarations of our will have come unto you, know that God is mighty and wise
Do the infidels expect less than that God should come down to them overshadowed with clouds, and the angels also? But the thing is decreed, and to God shall all things return
Ask the children of Israel how many evident signs we have shewed them; and whoever shall change the grace of God, after it shall have come unto him, verily God will be severe in punishing him
The present life was ordained for those who believe not, and they laugh the faithful to scorn; but they who fear God shall be above them, on the day of the resurrection: For God is bountiful unto whom he pleaseth without measure
Mankind was of one faith, and God sent prophets bearing good tidings, and denouncing threats, and sent down with them the scripture in truth, that it might judge between men of that concerning which they disagreed: And none disagreed concerning it, except those to whom the same scriptures were delivered, after the declarations of God's will had come unto them, out of envy among themselves. And God directed those who believed, to that truth concerning which they disagreed, by his will: For God directeth whom he pleaseth into the right way
Did ye think ye should enter paradise, when as yet no such thing had happened unto you, as hath happened unto those who have been before you? They suffered calamity, and tribulation, and were afflicted; so that the apostle, and they who believed with him, said; when will the help of God come? Is not the help of God nigh
They will ask thee what they shall bestow in alms: Answer, the good which ye bestow, let it be given to parents, and kindred, and orphans, and the poor, and the stranger. Whatsoever good ye do, God knoweth it
War is enjoined you against the infidels; but this is hateful unto you: Yet perchance ye hate a thing which is better for you, and perchance ye love a thing which is worse for you: But God knoweth and ye know not
They will ask thee concerning the sacred month, whether they may war therein: Answer, to war therein is grievous; but to obstruct the way of God, and infidelity towards him, and to keep men from the holy temple, and to drive out his people from thence, is more grievous in the sight of God, and the temptation to idolatry is more grievous than to kill in the sacred months. They will not cease to war against you, until they turn you from your religion, if they be able: But whoever among you shall turn back from his religion, and die an infidel, their works shall be vain in this world, and the next; they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall remain therein for ever
But they who believe, and who fly for the sake of religion, and fight in God's cause, they shall hope for the mercy of God; for God is gracious and merciful
They will ask thee concerning wine and lots: Answer, in both there is great sin, and also some things of use unto men; but their sinfulness is greater than their use. They will ask thee also what they shall bestow in alms: Answer, what ye have to spare. Thus God sheweth his signs unto you, that peradventure ye might seriously think
of this present world, and of the next. They will also ask thee concerning orphans: Answer, to deal righteously with them is best and if ye intermeddle with the management of what belongs to them, do them no wrong; they are your brethren: God knoweth the corrupt dealer from the righteous; and if God please, he will surely distress you, for God is mighty and wise
Marry not women who are idolaters, until they believe: Verily a maid servant who believeth, is better than an idolatress, although she please you more. And give not women who believe, in marriage to the idolaters, until they believe; for verily a servant, who is a true believer, is better than an idolater, though he please you more. They invite unto hell fire, but God inviteth unto paradise and pardon through his will, and declareth his signs unto men, that they may remember
They will ask thee also, concerning the courses of women: Answer, they are a pollution: Therefore separate your selves from women in their courses, and go not near them, until they be cleansed. But when they are cleansed, go in unto them as God hath commanded you, for God loveth those who repent, and loveth those who are clean
Your wives are your tillage; go in therefore unto your tillage in what manner soever ye will: And do first some act that may be profitable unto your souls; and fear God, and know that ye must meet him; and bear good tidings unto the faithful
Make not God the object of your oaths, that ye will deal justly, and be devout, and make peace among men; for God is he who heareth and knoweth
God will not punish you for an inconsiderate word in your oaths; but he will punish you for that which your hearts have assented unto: God is merciful and gracious
They who vow to abstain from their wives, are allowed to wait four months: But if they go back from their vow, verily God is gracious and merciful
and if they resolve on a divorce, God is he who heareth and knoweth
The women who are divorced shall wait concerning themselves until they have their courses thrice, and it shall not be lawful for them to conceal that which God hath created in their wombs, if they believe in God and the last day; and their husbands will act more justly to bring them back at this time, if they desire a reconciliation. The women ought also to behave towards their husbands in like manner as their husbands should behave towards them, according to what is just: But the men ought to have a superiority over them. God is mighty and wise
Ye may divorce your wives twice; and then either retain them with humanity, or dismiss them with kindness. But it is not lawful for you to take away any thing of what ye have given them, unless both fear that they cannot observe the ordinances of God. And if ye fear that they cannot observe the ordinances of God, it shall be no crime in either of them of account of that for which the wife shall redeem her self. These are the ordinances of God; therefore transgress them not; for whoever transgresseth the ordinances of God, they are unjust doers
But if the husband divorce her a third time, she shall not be lawful for him again, until she marry another husband. But if he also divorce her, it shall be no crime in them, if they return to each other, if they think they can observe the ordinances of God; and these are the ordinances of God, he declareth them to people of understanding
But when ye divorce women, and they have fulfilled their prescribed time, either retain them with humanity, or dismiss them with kindness; and retain them not by violence, so that ye transgress; for he who doth this, surely injureth his own soul. And make not the signs of God a jest: But remember God's favour towards you, and that he hath sent down unto you the book of the Koran, and wisdom, admonishing you thereby; and fear God, and know that God is omniscient
But when ye have divorced your wives, and they have fulfilled their prescribed time, hinder them not from marrying their husbands, when they have agreed among themselves according to what is honourable. This is given in admonition unto him among you who believeth in God, and the last day. This is most righteous for you, and most pure. God knoweth, but ye know not
Mothers after they are divorced shall give suck unto their children two full years, to him who desireth the time of giving suck to be completed; and the father shall be obliged to maintain them and cloath them in the mean time, according to that which shall be reasonable. No person shall be obliged beyond his ability. A mother shall not be compelled to what is unreasonable on account of her child, nor a father on account of his child. And the heir of the father shall be obliged to do in like manner. But if they choose to wean the child before the end of two years, by common consent, and on mutual consideration, it shall be no crime in them. And if ye have a mind to provide a nurse for your children, it shall be no crime in you, in case ye fully pay what ye offer her, according to that which is just. And fear God, and know that God seeth whatsoever ye do
Such of you as die, and leave wives, their wives must wait concerning themselves four months and ten days, and when they shall have fulfilled their term, it shall be no crime in you, for that which they shall do with themselves, according to what is reasonable. God well knoweth that which ye do
And it shall be no crime in you, whether ye make public overtures of marriage unto such women, within the said four months and ten days, or whether ye conceal such your designs in your minds: God knoweth that ye will remember them. But make no promise unto them privately, unless ye speak honourable words; and resolve not on the knot of marriage, until the prescribed time be accomplished; and know that God knoweth that which is in your minds, therefore beware of him, and know that God is gracious and merciful
It shall be no crime in you, if ye divorce your wives, so long as ye have not touched them, nor settled any dowry on them. And provide for them -- he who is at his ease must provide according to his circumstances, and he who is straitened according to his circumstances -- necessaries, according to what shall be reasonable. This is a duty incumbent on the righteous
But if ye divorce them before ye have touched them, and have already settled a dowry on them, ye shall give them half of what ye have settled, unless they release any part, or he release part in whose hand the knot of marriage is; and if ye release the whole, it will approach nearer unto piety. And forget not liberality among you, for God seeth that which ye do
Carefully observe the appointed prayers, and the middle prayer, and be assiduous therein, with devotion towards God
But if ye fear any danger, pray on foot or on horseback; and when ye are safe, remember God, how he hath taught you what as yet ye knew not
And such of you as shall die and leave wives, ought to bequeath their wives a year's maintenance, without putting them out of their houses: But if they go out voluntarily, it shall be no crime in you, for that which they shall do with themselves, according to what shall be reasonable; God is mighty and wise
And unto those who are divorced, a reasonable provision is also due; this is a duty incumbent on those who fear God
Thus God declareth his signs unto you, that ye may understand
Hast thou not considered those, who left their habitations, -- and they were thousands -- for fear of death? And God said unto them, die; then he restored them to life, for God is gracious towards mankind; but the greater part of men do not give thanks
Fight for the religion of God, and know that God is he who heareth and knoweth
Who is he that will lend unto God on good usury? Verily he will double it unto him manifold; for God contracteth and extendeth his hand as he pleaseth, and to him shall ye return
Hast thou not considered the assembly of the children of Israel, after the time of Moses; when they said unto their prophet Samual, set a king over us, that we may fight for the religion of God? The prophet answered, if ye are enjoined to go to war, will ye be near refusing to fight? They answered, and what should ail us that we should not fight for the religion of God, seeing we are dispossessed of our habitations, and deprived of our children? But when they were enjoined to go to war, they turned back, except a few of them: And God knew the ungodly
And their prophet said unto them, verily God hath set Jalut, king over you: They answered, how shall he reign over us, seeing we are more worthy of the kingdom than he, neither is he possessed of great riches? Samual said, verily God hath chosen him before you, and hath caused him to increase in knowledge and stature, for God giveth his kingdom unto whom he pleaseth; God is bounteous and wise
And their prophet said unto them, verily the sign of his kingdom shall be, that the ark shall come unto you; Therein shall be tranquility from your Lord, and the relics which have been left by the family of Moses, and the family of Aaron; the angels shall bring it. Verily this shall be a sign unto you, if ye believe
And when Jalut departed with his soldiers, he said, verily God will prove you by the river: For he who drinketh thereof, shall not be on my side -- but he who shall not taste thereof he shall be on my side -- except he who drinketh a draught out of his hand. And they drank thereof, except a few of them. And when they had passed the river, he and those who believed with him, they said, we have no strength to day, against Jalut and his forces. But they who considered that they should meet God at the resurrection, said, how often hath a small army discomfited a great army, by the will of God? And God is with those who patiently persevere
And when they went forth to battle against Jalut and his forces, they said, O Lord, pour on us patience, and confirm our feet, and help us against the unbelieving people
Therefore they discomfited them, by the will of God, and David slew Jalut. And God gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him his will, and if God had not prevented men, the one by the other, verily the earth had been corrupted: But God is beneficent towards his creatures
These are the signs of God: We rehearse them unto thee with truth, and thou art surely one of those who have been sent by God
These are the apostles; we have preferred some of them before others: Some of them hath God spoken unto, and hath exalted the degree of others of them. And we gave unto Jesus the son of Mary manifest signs, and strengthened him with the holy spirit. And if God had pleased, they who came after those apostles, would not have contended among themselves, after manifest signs had been shewn unto them. But they fell to variance; therefore some of them believed, and some of them believed not; and if God had so pleased, they would not have contended among themselves, but God doth what he will
O true believers, give alms of that which we have bestowed on you, before the day cometh wherein there shall be no merchandizing, nor friendship, nor intercession. The infidels are unjust doers
God! There is no God but he; the living, the self-subsisting: Neither slumber nor sleep seizeth him; to him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven, and on earth. Who is he that can intercede with him, but through his good pleasure? He knoweth that which is past, and that which is to come unto them, and they shall not comprehend any thing of his knowledge, but so far as he pleaseth. His throne is extended over heaven and earth, and the preservation of both is no burden unto him. He is the high, the mighty
Let there be no violence in religion. Now is right direction manifestly distinguished from deceit: Whoever therefore shall deny Tagut(false gods), and believe in God, he shall surely take hold on a strong handle, which shall not be broken; God is he who heareth and seeth
God is the patron of those who believe; he shall lead them out of darkness into light: But as to those who believe not, their patrons are Tagut(false gods); they shall lead them from the light into darkness; they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall remain therein for ever
Hast thou not considered him who disputed with Abraham concerning his Lord, because God had given him the kingdom? When Abraham said, my Lord is he who giveth life, and killeth: He answered, I give life, and I kill. Abraham said, verily God bringeth the sun from the east, now do thou bring it from the west. Whereupon the infidel was confounded; for God directeth not the ungoldly people
Or hast thou not considered how he behaved who passed by a city which had been destroyed, even to her foundations? He said, how shall God quicken this city, after she hath been dead? And God caused him to die for an hundred years, and afterwards raised him to life. And God said, how long hast thou tarried here? He answered, a day, or part of a day. God said, nay, thou hast tarried here an hundred years. Now look on thy food and thy drink, they are not yet corrupted; and look on thine ass: And this have we done that we might make thee a sign unto men. And look on the bones of thine ass, how we raise them, and afterwards cloath them with flesh. And when this was shewn unto him, he said, I know that God is able to do all things
And when Abraham said, O Lord, shew me how thou wilt raise the dead; God said, dost thou not yet believe? He answered, yea; but I ask this that my heart may rest at ease. God said, take therefore four birds, and divide them; then lay a part of them on every mountain; then call them, and they shall come swiftly unto thee: And know that God is mighty and wise
The similitude of those who lay out their substance for advancing the religion of God, is as a grain of corn which produceth seven ears, and in every ear an hundred grains; for God giveth twofold unto whom he pleaseth: God is bounteous and wise
They who lay out their substance for the religion of God, and afterwards follow not what they have so laid out by reproaches or mischief, they shall have their reward with their Lord; upon them shall no fear come, neither shall they be grieved
A fait speech, and to forgive, is better than alms followed by mischief. God is rich and merciful
O true believers, make not your alms of none effect by reproaching, or mischief, as he who layeth out what he hath to appear unto men to give alms, and believeth not in God and the last day. The likeness of such a one, is as a flint covered with earth, on which a violent rain falleth, and leaveth it hard. They cannot prosper in any thing which they have gained, for God directeth not the unbelieving people
And the likeness of those who lay out their substance from a desire to please God, and for an establishment for their souls, is as a garden on a hill, on which a violent rain falleth, and it bringeth forth its fruits twofold; and if a violent rain falleth not on it, yet the dew falleth thereon: And God seeth that which ye do
Doth any of you desire to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, through which rivers flow, wherein he may have all kinds of fruits, and that he may attain to old age, and have a weak off-spring? Then a violent fiery wind shall strike it, so that it shall be burned. Thus God declareth his signs unto you, that ye may consider
O true believers bestow alms of the good things which ye have gained, and of that which we have produced for you out of the earth, and choose not the bad thereof, to give it in alms, such as ye would not accept your selves, otherwise than by connivance: And know that God is rich and worthy to be praised
The devil threateneth you with poverty, and commandeth you filthy covetousness, but God promiseth you pardon from himself and abundance: God bounteous and wise
He giveth wisdom unto whom he pleaseth, and he unto whom wisdom is given, hath received much good: But none will consider, except the wise of heart
And whatever alms ye shall give, or whatever vow ye shall vow, verily God knoweth it; but the ungodly shall have none to help them
If ye make your alms to appear, it is well; but if ye conceal them, and give them unto the poor, this will be better for you, and will atone for your sins: And God is well informed of that which ye do
The direction of them belongeth not unto thee; but God directeth whom he pleaseth. The good that ye shall give in alms shall redound unto your selves; and ye shall not give unless out of desire of seeing the face of God. And what good thing ye shall give in alms, it shall be repaid you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly
unto the poor who are wholly employed in fighting for the religion of God, and cannot go to and fro in the earth; whom the ignorant man thinketh rich, because of their modesty: Thou shalt know them by this mark, they ask not men with importunity; and what good ye shall give in alms, verily God knoweth it
They who distribute alms of their substance night and day, in private and in public, shall have their reward with their Lord; on them shall no fear come, neither shall they be grieved
They who devour usury shall not arise from the dead, but as he ariseth whom Satan hath infected by a touch: This shall happen to them because they say. Truly selling is but as usury: And yet God hath permitted selling and forbidden usury. He therefore who when there cometh unto him an admonition from his Lord, abstaineth from usury for the future, shall have what is past forgiven him, and his affair belongeth unto God. But whoever returneth to usury, they shall be the companions of hell fire, they shall continue therein for ever
God shall take his blessing from usury, and shall increase alms: For God loveth no infidel, or ungodly person
But they who believe and do that which is right, and observe the stated times of prayer, and pay their legal alms, they shall have their reward with their Lord: There shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
O true believers, fear God, and remit that which remaineth of usury, if ye really believe
but if ye do it not, hearken unto war, which is declared against you from God and his apostle: Yet if ye repent, ye shall have the capital of your money. Deal not unjustly with others, and ye shall not be dealt with unjustly
If there be an debtor under a difficulty of paying his debt, let his creditor wait till it be easy for him to do it; but if ye remit it as alms, it will be better for you, if ye knew it
And fear the day wherein ye shall return unto God, then shall every soul be paid what it hath gained, and they shall not be treated unjustly
O true believers, when ye bind yourselves one to the other in a debt for a certain time, write it down; and let a writer write between you according to justice, and let not the writer refuse writing according to what God hath taught him; but let him write, and let him who oweth the debt dictate, and let him fear God his Lord, and not diminish ought thereof. But if he who oweth the debt be foolish, or weak, or be not able to dictate himself, let his agent dictate according to equity; and call to witness two witnesses of your neighbouring men; but if there be not two men, let there be a man and two women of those whom ye shall choose for witnesses: If one of those women should mistake, the other of them will cause her to recollect. And the witnesses shall not refuse, whensoever they shall be called. And disdain not to write it down, be it a large debt, or be it a small one, until its time of payment: This will be more just in the sight of God, and more right for bearing witness, and more easy, that ye may not doubt. But if it be a present bargain which ye transact between your selves, it shall be no crime in you, if ye write it not down. And take witnesses when ye sell one to the other, and let no harm be done to the writer, nor to the witness; which if ye do, it will surely be injustice in you: And fear God, and God will instruct you, for God knoweth all things
And if ye be on a journey, and find no writer, let pledges be taken: But if one of you trust the other, let him who is trusted return what he is trusted with, and fear God his Lord. And conceal not the testimony, for he who concealeth it, hath surely a wicked heart: God knoweth that which ye do
Whatever is in heaven, and on earth is God's: And whether ye manifest that which is in your minds, or conceal it, God will call you to account for it, and will forgive whom he pleaseth, and will punish whom he pleaseth; for God is almighty
The apostle believeth in that which hath been sent down unto him from his Lord, and the faithful also. Every one of them believeth in God, and his angels, and his scriptures, and his apostles: We make no distinction at all between his apostles. And they say, we have heard, and do obey: We implore thy mercy, O Lord, for unto thee must we return
God will not force any soul beyond its capacity: It shall have the good which it gaineth, and it shall suffer the evil which it gaineth. O Lord punisth us not, if we forget, or act sinfully: O Lord lay not on us a burden like that which thou hast laid on those who have been before us; neither make us, O Lord, to bear what we have not strength to bear, but be favourable unto us, and spare us, and be merciful unto us. Thou art our patron, help us therefore against the unbelieving nations
M
There is no God but God, the living, the self-subsisting
He hath sent down unto thee the book of the Koran with truth, confirming that which was revealed before it; for he had formerly sent down the law, and the gospel
a direction unto men; and he had also sent down the distinction between good and evil. Verily those who believe not the signs of God, shall suffer a grievous punishment; for God is mighty, able to revenge
Surely nothing is hidden from God, of that which is on earth, or in heaven
it is he who formeth you in the wombs, as he pleaseth; there is no God but he, the mighty, the wise
It is he who hath sent down unto thee the book, wherein are some verses clear to be understood, they are the foundation of the book; and others are parabolical. But they whose hearts are perverse will follow that which is parabolical therein, out of love of schism, and a desire of the interpretation thereof; yet none knoweth the interpretation thereof, except God. But they who are well grounded in knowledge say, we believe therein, the whole is from our Lord; and none will consider except the prudent
O Lord, cause not our hearts to swerve from truth, after thou hast directed us: And give us from thee mercy, for thou art he who giveth
O Lord, thou shalt surely gather mankind together, unto a day of resurrection: There is no doubt of it, for God will not be contrary to the promise
As for the infidels, their wealth shall not profit them any thing, nor their children, against God: They shall be the fewel of hell fire
According to the wont of the people of Pharaoh, and of those who went before them, they charged our signs with a lie; but God caught them in their wickedness, and God is severe in punishing
Say unto those who believe not, ye shall be overcome, and thrown together into hell ; an unhappy couch shall it be
Ye have already had a miracle shewn you in two armies which attacked each other: One army fought for God's true religion, but the other were infidels; they saw the faithful twice as many as themselves in their eye-sight; for God strengtheneth with his help whom he pleaseth. Surely herein was an example unto men of understanding
The love and eager desire of wives, and children, and sums heaped up of gold and silver, and excellent horses, and cattle, and land, is prepared for men: This is the provision of the present life; but unto God shall be the most excellent return
Say, shall I declare unto you better things than this? For those who are devout are prepared with their Lord, gardens through which rivers flow; therin shall they continue for ever : And they shall enjoy wives free from impurity, and the favour of God; for God regardeth his servants
who say, O Lord we do sincerely believe; forgive us therefore our sins, and deliver us from the pain of hell fire
The patient, and the lovers of truth, and the devout, and the almsgivers, and those who ask pardon early in the morning
God hath born witness that there is no God but he; and the angels, and those who are endowed with wisdom profess the same; who executeth righteousness; there is no God but he; the mighty, the wise
Verily the true religion in the sight of God, is Islam; and they who had received the scriptures dissented not therefrom, until after the knowledge of God's unity had come unto them, out of envy among themselves; but whosoever believeth not in the signs of God, verily God will be swift in bringing him to account
If they dispute with thee, say, I have resigned my self unto God, and he who followeth me doth the same: And say unto them who have received the scriptures, and to the ignorant, do ye profess the religion of Islam? Now if they embrace Islam, they are surely directed; but if they turn their backs, verily unto thee belongeth preaching only; for God regardeth his servants
And unto those who believe not in the signs of God, and slay the prophets without a cause, and put those men to death who teach justice; denounce unto them a painful punishment
These are they whose works perish in this world, and in that which is to come; and they shall have none to help them
Hast thou not observed those unto whom part of the scripture was given? They were called unto the book of God, that it might judge between them; then some of them turned their backs, and retired afar off
This they did because they said, the fire of hell shall by no means touch us, but for a certain number of days: And that which they had falsly devised, hath deceived them in their religion
How then will it be with them, when we shall gather them together at the day of judgment, of which there is no doubt; and every soul shall be paid that which it hath gained, neither shall they be treated unjustly
Say, O God, who possessest the kingdom; thou givest the kingdom unto whom thou wilt, and thou takest away the kingdom from whom thou wilt: Thou exaltest whom thou wilt, and thou humblest whom thou wilt: In thy had is good, for thou art almighty
Thou makest the night to succeed the day: Thou bringest forth the living out of the dead, and thou bringest forth the dead out of the living; and providest food for whom thou wilt without measure
Let not the faithful take the infidels for their protectors, rather than the faithful: He who doth this, shall not be protected of God at all; unless ye fear any danger from them: But God warneth you to beware of himself; for unto God must ye return
Say, whether ye conceal that which is in your breasts, or whether ye declare it, God knoweth it; for he knoweth whatever is in heaven, and whatever is on earth: God is almighty
On the last day every soul shall find the good which it hath wrought, present; and the evil which it hath wrought, it shall wish that between it self and that were a wide distance: But God warneth you to beware of himself; for God is gracious unto his servants
Say, if ye love God, follow me: Then God shall love you, and forgive you your sins; for God is gracious, and merciful
Say, obey God, and his apostle: But if ye go back, verily God loveth not the unbelievers
God hath surely chosen Adam, and Noah, and the family of Abraham, and the family of Imran above the rest of the world
a race descending the one from the other: God is he who heareth and knoweth
Remember when the wife of Imran said, Lord, verily I have vowed unto thee that which is in my womb, to be dedicated to thy service: Accept it therefore of me; for thou art he who heareth and knoweth
And when she was delivered of it, she said, Lord, verily I have brought forth a female, -- and God well knew what she had brought forth -- and a male is not as a female: I have called her Mary; and I commend her to thy protection, and also her issue, against Satan driven away with stones
Therefore the Lord accepted her with a gracious acceptance, and caused her to bear an excellent offspring. And Zacharias took care of the child; whenever Zacharias went into the chamber to her, he found provisions with her: And he said, O Mary, whence hadst thou this? She answered, this is from God: For God provideth for whom he pleaseth without measure
There Zacharias called on his Lord, and said, Lord, give me from thee a good offspring, for thou art the hearer of prayer
And the angels called to him, while he stood praying in the chamber, saying, verily God promiseth thee a son named John, who shall bear witness to the word which cometh from God; an honourable person, chast, and one of the righteous prophets
He answered, Lord, how shall I have a son, when old age hath overtaken me, and my wife is barren? The angel said, so God doth that which he pleaseth
Zacharias answered, Lord, give me a sign. The angel said, thy sign shall be, that thou shalt speak unto no man for three days, otherwise than by gesture: Remember thy Lord often, and praise him evening and morning
And when the angels said, O Mary, verily God hath chosen thee, and hath purified thee, and hath chosen thee above all the women of the world
O Mary, be devout towards thy Lord, and worship, and bow down with those who bow down
This is a secret history: We reveal it unto thee, although thou wast not present with them when they threw in their rods to cast lots which of them should have the education of Mary; neither wast thou with them, when they strove among themselves
When the angels said; O Mary, verily God sendeth thee good tidings, that thou shalt bear the word, proceeding from himself; his name shall be Christ Jesus the son of Mary, honourable in this world and in the world to come, and one of those who approach near to the presence of God
and he shall speak unto men in the cradle, and when he is grown up; and he shall be one of the righteous
She answered, Lord, how shall I have a son, since a man hath not touched me? The Angel said, so God createth that which he pleaseth: When he decreeth a thing, he only saith unto it, be, and it is
God shall teach him the scripture, and wisdom, and the law, and the gospel
and shall appoint him his apostle to the children of Israel; and he shall say, verily I come unto you with a sign from your Lord; for I will make before you, of clay, as it were the figure of a bird; then I will breathe thereon, and it shall become a bird, by the permission of God: And I will heal him that hath been blind from his birth; and the leper: And I will raise the dead by the permission of God: And I will prophesy unto you what ye eat, and what ye lay up for store in your houses. Verily herein will be a sign unto you, if ye believe
And I come to confirm the law which was revealed before me, and to allow unto you as lawful, part of that which hath been forbidden you: And I come unto you with a sign from your Lord; therefore fear God, and obey me
Verily God is my Lord, and your Lord: Therefore serve him. This is the right way
But when Jesus perceived their unbelief, he said, who will be my helpers towards God? The apostles answered, we will be the helpers of God; we believe in God, and do thou bear witness that we are true believers
O Lord, we believe in that which thou hast sent down, and we have followed thy apostle; write us down therefore with those who bear witness of him
And the Jews devised a stratagem against him; but God devised a stratagem against them; and God is the best deviser of stratagems
When God said, O Jesus, verily I will cause thee to die, and I will take thee up unto me, and I will deliver thee from the unbelievers; and I will place those who follow thee, above the unbelievers, until the day of resurrection: Then unto me shall ye return, and I will judge between you of that concerning which ye disagree
Moreover, as for the infidels, I will punish them with a grievous punishment in this world, and in that which is to come; and there shall be none to help them
But they who believe, and do that which is right, he shall give them their reward; for God loveth not the wicked doers
These signs, and this prudent admonition do we rehearse unto thee
Verily the likeness of Jesus in the sight of God, is as the likeness of Adam: He created him out of the dust, and then said unto him, be; and he was
This is the truth from thy Lord; be not therefore one of those who doubt
And whoever shall dispute with thee concerning him, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, say unto them, come, let us call together our sons, and your sons, and our wives, and your wives, and our selves, and your selves; then let us make imprecations, and lay the curse of God on those who lie
Verily this is a true history: And there is no God, but God; and God is most mighty, and wise
If they turn back, God well knoweth the evil doers
Say, O ye who have received the scripture, come to a just determination between us and you; that we worship not any except God, and associate no creature with him; and that the one of us take not the other for lords, beside God. But if they turn back, say, bear witness that we are true believers
O ye to whom the scriptures have been given, why do ye dispute concerning Abraham, since the law and the gospel were not sent down until after him? Do ye not therefore understand
Behold ye are they who dispute concerning that which ye have some knowledge in; why therefore do ye dispute concerning that which ye have no knowledge of? God knoweth, but ye know not
Abraham was neither a Jew, nor a Christian; but he was of the true religion, one resigned unto God, and was not of the number of the idolaters
Verily the men who are the nearest of kin unto Abraham, are they who follow him; and this prophet, and they who believe on him: God is the patron of the faithful
Some of those who have received the scriptures desire to seduce you; but they seduce themselves only, and they perceive it not
O ye who have received the scriptures, why do ye not believe in the signs of God, since ye are witnesses of them
O ye who have received the scriptures, why do ye clothe truth with vanity, and knowingly hide the truth
And some of those to whom the scriptures were given, say, believe in that which hath been sent down unto those who believe, in the beginning of the day; and deny it in the end thereof; that they may go back from their faith
And believe him only who followeth your religion. Say, verily the true direction is the direction of God, that there may be given unto some other a revelation like unto what hath been given unto you. Will they dispute with you before your Lord? Say, surely excellence is in the hand of God, he giveth it unto whom he pleaseth; God is bounteous and wise
He will confer peculiar mercy on whom he pleaseth; for God is indued with great beneficence
There is of those who have received the scriptures, unto whom if thou trust a talent, he will restore it unto thee; and there is also of them, unto whom is thou trust a dinar, he will not restore it unto thee, unless thou stand over him continually with great urgency. This they do because they say, we are not obliged to observe justice with the heathen: But they utter a lie against God, knowingly
Yea; whoso keepeth his covenant, and feareth God, God surely loveth those who fear him
But they who make merchandize of God's covenant, and of their oaths, for a small price, shall have no portion in the next life, neither shall God speak to them or regard them on the day of resurrection, nor shall he cleanse them; but they shall suffer a grievous punishment
And there are certainly some of them, who read the scriptures perversely, that ye may think what they read to be really in the scriptures, yet it is not in the scripture; and they say, this is from God; but it is not from God: And they speak that which is false concerning God, against their own knowledge
It is not fit for a man, that God should give him a book of revelations, and wisdom, and prophecy; and then he should say unto men, be ye worshippers of me, besides God; but he ought to say, be ye perfect in knowledge and in works, since ye know the scriptures, and exercise your selves therein
God hath not commanded you to take the angels and the prophets for your Lords: Will He command you to become infidels, after ye have been true believers
And remember when God accepted the covenant of the prophets, saying, this verily is the scripture and the wisdom which I have given you: Hereafter shall an apostle come unto you, conforming the truth of that scripture which is with you; ye shall surely believe on Him, and ye shall assist Him. God said, are ye firmly resolved, and do ye accept my covenant on this condition? They answered, we are firmly resolved: God said, be ye therefore witnesses; and I also bear witness with you
And whosoever turneth back after this, they are surely the transgressors
Do they therefore seek any other religion but God's? Since to him is resigned whosoever is in heaven or on earth, voluntarily, or of force: And to him shall they return
Say, we believe in God, and that which hath been sent down unto us, and that which was sent down unto Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which was delivered to Moses, and Jesus, and the prophets, from their Lord; we make no distinction between any of them; and to him are we resigned
Whoever followeth any other religion than Islam, it shall not be accepted of him: And in the next life he shall be of those who perish
How shall God direct men who have become infidels after they had believed, and born witness that the apostle was true, and manifest declarations of the divine will had come unto them? For God directeth not the ungodly people
Their reward shall be, that on them shall fall the curse of God, and of angels, and of all mankind
They shall remain under the same for ever; their torment shall not be mitigated, neither shall they be regarded
except those who repent after this, and amend; for God is gracious and merciful
Moreover they who become infidels after they have believed, and yet increase in infidelity, their repentance shall in no wise be accepted, and they are those who go astray
Verily they who believe not, and die in their unbelief, the world full of gold shall in no wise be accepted from any of them, even though he should give it for his ransom; they shall suffer a grievous punishment, and they shall have none to help them
Ye will never attain unto righteousness, until ye give in alms of that which ye love: And whatever ye give, God knoweth it
All food was permitted unto the children of Israel, except what Israel forbad unto himself, before the Pentateuch was sent down. Say unto the Jews, bring hither the Pentateuch and read it, if ye speak truth

Say, God is true: Follow ye therefore the religion of Abraham the orthodox; for he was no idolater
Verily the first house appointed unto men to worship in was that which is in Becca; blessed, and a direction to all creatures
Therein are manifest signs: The place where Abraham stood; and whoever entereth therein, shall be safe. And it is a duty towards God, incumbent on those who are able to go thither, to visit this house; but whosoever disbelieveth, verily God needeth not the service of any creature
Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, why do ye not believe in the signs of God
Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, why do ye keep back from the way of God, him who believeth? Ye seek to make it crooked, and yet are witnesses that it is the right: But God will not be unmindful of what ye do
O true believers, if ye obey some of those who have received the scripture, they will render you infidels, after ye have believed
And how can ye be infidels, when the signs of God are read unto you, and his apostle is among you? But he who cleaveth firmly unto God, is already directed into the right way
O believers, fear God with his true fear; and die not unless ye also be true believers
And cleave all of you unto the covenant of God, and depart not from it, and remember the favour of God towards you: Since ye were enemies, and he reconciled your hearts, and ye became companions and brethren by his favour: And ye were on the brink of a pit of fire, and he delivered you thence. Thus God declareth unto you his signs, that ye may be directed
Let there be people among you, who invite to the best religion; and command that which is just, and forbid that which is evil; and they shall be happy
And be not as they who are divided, and disagree in matters of religion, after manifest proofs have been brought unto them: They shall suffer a great torment
On the day of resurrection some faces shall become white, and other faces shall become black. And unto them whose faces shall become black, God will say, have ye returned unto your unbelief, after ye had believed? Therefore taste the punishment, for that ye have been unbelievers
But they whose faces shall become white shall be in the mercy of God, therein shall they remain for ever
These are the signs of God: We recite them unto thee with truth. God will not deal unjustly with his creatures
And to God belongeth whatever is in heaven and on earth; and to God shall all things return
Ye are the best nation that hath been raised up unto mankind: Ye command that which is just, and ye forbid that which is unjust, and ye believe in God. And if they who have recieved the scriptures had believed, it had surely been the better for them: There are believers among them, but the greater part of them are transgressors
They shall not hurt you, unless with a slight hurt; and if they fight against you, they shall turn their backs to you; and they shall not be helped
They are smitten with vileness wheresoever they are found; unless they obtain security by entering into a treaty with God, and a treaty with men: And they draw on themselves indignation from God, and they are afflicted with poverty. This they suffer, because they disbelieved the signs of God, and slew the prophets unjustly; this, because they were rebellious, and transgressed
Yet they are not all alike: There are of those who have received the scriptures, upright people; they meditate on the signs of God in the night season, and worship
They believe in God, and the last day; and command that which is just, and forbid that which is unjust, and zealously strive to excel in good works: These are of the righteous
And ye shall not be denied the reward of the good which ye do; for God knoweth the pious
As for the unbelievers, their wealth shall not profit them at all, neither their children, against God: They shall be the companions of hell fire; they shall continue therein for ever
The likeness of that which they lay out in this present life, is as a wind wherein there is a scorching cold: It falleth on the standing corn of those men who have injured their own souls, and destroyeth it. And God dealeth not unjustly with them; but they injure their own souls
O true believers, contract not an intimate friendship with any besides your selves: They will not fail to corrupt you. They wish for that which may cause you to perish: Their hatred hath already appeared from out of their mouths; but what their breasts conceal is yet more inveterate. We have already shewn you signs of their ill will towards you, if ye understand
Behold, ye love them, and they do not love you: Ye believe in all the scriptures, and when they meet you, they say, we believe; but when they assemble privately togeher, they bite their fingers ends out of wrath against you. Say unto them, die in your wrath: Verily God knoweth the innermost part of your breasts
If good happen unto you, it grieveth them; and if evil befall you, they rejoice at it. But if ye be patient, and fear God, their subtlety shall not hurt you at all; for God comprehendeth whatever they do
Call to mind when thou wentest forth early from thy family, that thou mightest prepare the faithful a camp for war; and God heard and knew it
when two companies of you were anxiously thoughtful, so that ye became faint-hearted; but God was the supporter of them both; and in God let the faithful trust
And God had already given you the victory at Bedr, when ye were inferior in number; therefore fear God, that ye may be thankful
When thou saidst unto the faithful, is it not enough for you, that your Lord should assist you with three thousand angels, sent down from heaven
Verily if ye persevere, and fear God, and your enemies come upon you suddenly, your Lord will assist you with five thousand angels, distinguished by their horses and attire
And this God designed only as good tidings for you that your hearts might rest secure: For victory is from God alone, the mighty, the wise

O true believers, devour not usury, doubling it twofold; but fear God, that ye may prosper
And fear the fire which is prepared for the unbelievers
and obey God, and his apostle, that ye may obtain mercy
And run with emulation to obtain remission from your Lord, and paradise, whose breadth equalleth the heavens and the earth, which is prepared for the godly
who give alms in prosperity and adversity; who bridle their anger, and forgive men: For God loveth the beneficent
And who, after they have committed a crime, or dealt unjustly with their own souls, remember God, and ask pardon for their sins, -- for who forgiveth sins except God? -- and persevere not in what they have done knowingly
Their reward shall be pardon from their Lord, and gardens wherein rivers flow, they shall remain therein for ever: And how excellent is the reward of those who labour
There have already been before you examples of punishment of infidels, therefore go through the earth, and behold what hath been the end of those who accuse God's apostles of imposture
This book is a declaration unto men, and a direction, and an admonition to the pious
And be not dismayed, neither be ye grieved; for ye shall be superior to the unbelievers if ye believe
If a wound hath happended unto you in war, a like wound hath already happened unto the unbelieving people: And we cause these days of different success interchangeably to succeed each other among men; that God may know those who believe, and may have martyrs from among you: -- God loveth not the workers of iniquity
and that God might prove those who believe, and destroy the infidels
Did ye imagine that ye should enter paradise, when as yet God knew not those among you who fought strenuously in his cause; nor knew those who persevered with patience
Moreover ye did sometime wish for death before that ye met it; but ye have now seen it, and ye looked on, but retreated from it
Mohammed is no more than an apostle; the other apostles have already deceased before him: If he die therefore, or be slain, will ye turn back on your heels? But he who turneth back on his heels, will not hurt God at all; and God will surely reward the thankful
No soul can die unless by the permission of God, according to what is written in the book containing the determinations of things. And whoso chooseth the reward of this world, we will give him thereof: But whoso chooseth the reward of the world to come, we will give him thereof; and we will surely reward the thankful
How many prophets have encountered those who had many myriads of troops: And yet they desponded not in their mind for what had befallen them in fighting for the religion of God; and were not weakened, neither behaved themselves in an abject manner? God loveth those who persevere patiently
And their speech was no other than that they said, our Lord forgive us our offences and our transgressions in our business; and confirm our feet, and help us against the unbelieving people
And God gave them the reward of this world, and a glorious reward in the life to come; for God loveth the well-doers
O ye who believe, if ye obey the infidels, they will cause you to turn back on your heels, and ye will be turned back and perish
But God is your Lord; and he is the best helper
We will surely cast a dread into the hearts of the unbelievers, because they have associated with God that concerning which he sent them down no power: Their dwelling shall be the fire of hell; and the receptacle of the wicked shall be miserable
God had already made good unto you his promise, when ye destroyed them by his permission, until ye became faint-hearted and disputed concerning the command of the apostle, and were rebellious; after God had shewn you what ye desired. Some of you chose this present world, and others of you chose the world to come. Then he turned you to flight from before them, that he might make trial of you: -- But he hath now pardoned you; for God is indued with beneficence towards the faithful
when ye went up as ye fled, and looked not back on any; while the apostle called you, in the uttermost part of you. Therefore God rewarded you with affliction on affliction, that ye be not grieved hereafter for the spoils which ye fail of, nor for that which befalleth you; for God is well acquainted with whatever ye do
Then he sent down upon you after affliction security; a soft sleep which fell on some part of you; but other part were troubled by their own souls; falsely thinking of God a foolish imagination, saying, will any thing of the matter happen unto us? Say, verily the matter belongeth wholly unto God. They concealed in their minds what they declared not unto thee; saying, if any thing of the matter had happened unto us, we had not been slain here. Answer, if ye had been in your houses, verily they would have gone forth to fight, whose slaughter was decreed, to the places where they died, and this came to pass that God might try what was in your breasts, and might discern what was in your hearts; for God knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
Verily they among you who turned their backs on the day whereon the two armies met each other at Ohod, Satan caused them so slip, for some crime which they had committed: But now hath God forgiven them; for God is gracious and merciful
O true believers, be not as they who believed not, and said of their brethren, when they had journeyed in the land or had been at war, if they had been with us, those had not died, nor had these been slain: Whereas what befell them was so ordained that God might make it matter of sighing in their hearts. God giveth life, and causeth to die: And God seeth that which ye do
Moreover if ye be slain, or die in defence of the religion of God; verily pardon from God, and mercy is better than what they heap together of worldly riches
And if ye die, or be slain, verily unto God shall ye be gathered
And as to the mercy granted unto the disobedient from God, thou O Mohammed hast been mild towards them; but if thou hadst been severe, and hard-hearted, they had surely separated themselves from about thee. Therefore forgive them, and ask pardon for them: And consult them in the affair of war; and after thou hast deliberated, trust in God; for God loveth those who trust in Him
If God help you, none shall conquer you; but if he desert you, who is it that will help you after Him? Therefore in God let the faithful trust
It is not the part of a prophet to defraud, for he who defraudeth, shall bring with him what he hath defrauded any one of, on the day of the resurrection. Then shall every soul be paid what he hath gained; and they shall not be treated unjustly
Shall he therefore who followeth that which is well-pleasing unto God, be as he who bringeth on himself wrath from God, and whose receptacle is hell? An evil journey shall it be thither
There shall be degrees of rewards and punishments with God, for God seeth what they do
Now hath God been gracious unto the believers when he raised up among them an apostle of their own nation, who should recite his signs unto them, and purify them, and teach them the book of the Koran and wisdom; whereas they were before in manifest error
After a misfortune hath befallen you at Ohod, -- ye had already obtained two equal advantages -- do ye say, whence cometh this? Answer, this is from yourselves: For God is almighty
And what happened unto you, on the day whereon the two armies met, was certainly by the permission of God; and that he might know the faithful
and that he might know the ungodly. It was said unto them, come, fight for the religion of God, or drive back the enemy: They answered, if we had known ye went out to fight, we had certainly followed you. They were on that day nearer unto unbelief, than they were to faith; they spake with their mouths, what was not in their hearts: But God perfectly knew what they concealed
who said of their brethren, while themselves staid at home, if they had obeyed us, they had not been slain. Say, then keep back death from yourselves, if ye say truth
Thou shalt in no wise reckon those who have been slain at Ohod in the cause of God, dead; nay, they are sustained alive with their Lord
rejoicing for what God of his favour hath granted them; and being glad for those, who coming after them, have not as yet overtaken them; because there shall no fear come on them, neither shall they be grieved
They are filled with joy for the favour which they have received from God, and his bounty; and for that God suffereth not the reward of the faithful to perish
They who hearkened unto God and his apostle, after a wound had befallen them at Ohod, such of them as do good works, and fear God, shall have a great reward
unto whom certain men said, verily the men of Mecca have already gathered forces against you, be ye therefore afraid of them: But this increased their faith, and they said, God is our support, and the most excellent patron
Wherefore they returned with favour from God, and advantage; no evil befell them: And they followed what was well pleasing unto God; for God is endowed with great liberality
Verily that devil would cause you to fear his friends: But be ye not afraid of them; but fear me, if ye be true believers
They shall not grieve thee, who emulously hasten unto infidelity; for they shall never hurt God at all. God will not give them a part in the next life, and they shall suffer a great punishment
Surely those who purchase infidelity with faith, shall by no means hurt God at all, but they shall suffer a grievous punishment
And let not the unbelievers think, because we grant them lives long and prosperous, that it is better for their souls: We grant them long and prosperous lives only that their iniquity may be increased; and they shall suffer an ignominious punishment
God is not disposed to leave the faithful in the condition which ye are now in, until he sever the wicked from the good; nor is God disposed to make you acquainted with what is a hidden secret, but God chooseth such of his apostles as he pleaseth, to reveal his mind unto: Believe therefore in God, and his apostles; and if ye believe, and fear God, ye shall receive a great reward
And let not those who covetous of what God of his bounty hath granted them, imagine that their avarice is better for them: Nay, rather it is worse for them. That which they have covetously reserved shall be bound as a collar about their neck, on the day of the resurrection: Unto God belongeth the inheritance of heaven and earth; and God is well acquainted with what ye do
God hath already heard the saying of those who said, verily God is poor, and we are rich: We will surely write down what they have said, and the slaughter which they have made of the prophets without a cause; and we will say unto them, taste ye the pain of burning
This shall they suffer for the evil which their hands have sent before them; and because God is not unjust towards mankind
who also say, surely God hath commanded us, that we should not give credit to any apostle, until one should come unto us with a sacrifice, which should be consumed by fire. Say, apostles have already come unto you before me, with plain proofs, and with the miracle which ye mention: Why therefore have ye slain them, if ye speak truth
If they accuse thee of imposture, the apostles before thee have also been accounted impostors, who brought evident demonstrations, and the scriptures, and the book which enlighteneth the understanding
Every soul shall taste of death, and ye shall have your rewards on the day of resurrection; and he who shall be far removed from hell fire, and shall be admitted into paradise, shall be happy: But the present life is only a deceitful provision
Ye shall surely be proved in your possessions, and in your persons; and ye shall hear from those unto whom the scripture was delivered before you, and from the idolaters, much hurt: But if ye be patient, and fear God, this is a matter that is absolutely determined
And when God accepted the covenant of those to whom the book of the law was given, saying, ye shall surely publish it unto mankind, ye shall not hide it: Yet they threw it behind their backs, and sold it for a small price; but woful is the price for which they have sold it
Think not that they who rejoice at what they have done, and expect to be praised for what they have not done; think not, O prophet, that they shall escape from punishment, for they shall suffer a painful punishment
and unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth: God is almighty
Now in the creation of heaven and earth, and the vicissitude of night and day, are signs unto those who are indued with understanding
who remember God standing, and sitting, and lying on their sides; and meditate on the creation of heaven and earth, saying, O Lord, thou hast not created this in vain; far be it from thee: Therefore deliver us from the torment of hell fire
O Lord, surely whom thou shalt throw into the fire, thou wilt also cover with shame: Nor shall the ungodly have any to help them
O Lord, we have heard a preacher inviting us to the faith, and saying, believe in your Lord: And we believed. O Lord, forgive us therefore our sins, and expiate our evil deeds from us, and make us to die with the righteous
O Lord, give us also the reward which thou hast promised by thy apostles; and cover us not with shame on the day of resurrection; for thou art not contrary to the promise
Their Lord therefore answereth them, saying, I will not suffer the work of him among you who worketh to be lost, whether he be male, or female: The one of you is from the other. They therefore who have left their country, and have been turned out of their houses, and have suffered for my sake, and have been slain in battle; verily I will expiate their evil deeds from them, and I will surely bring them into gardens watered by rivers: a reward from God: And with God is the most excellent reward
Let not the prosperous dealing of the unbelievers in the land, deceive thee
It is but a slender provision; and then their receptacle shall be hell; an unhappy couch shall it be
But they who fear their Lord shall have gardens through which rivers flow, they shall continue therein for ever : This is the gift of God; for what is with God shall be better for the righteous than short-lived worldly prosperity
There are some of those who have received the scriptures, who believe in God, and that which hath been sent down unto you, and that which hath been sent down to them, submitting themselves unto God; they sell not the signs of God for a small price: These shall have their reward with their Lord; for God is swift in taking an account
O true believers, be patient, and strive to excel in patience, and be constant-minded, and fear God, that ye may be happy
O men, fear your Lord, who hath created you out of one man, and out of him created his wife, and from them two hath multiplied many men, and women: And fear God by whom ye beseech one another; and respect women who have born you, for God is watching over you
And give the orphans when they come to age their substance; and render them not in exchange bad for good: And devour not their substance, by adding it to your own substance; for this is a great sin
And if ye fear that ye shall not act with equity towards orphans of the female sex, take in marriage of such other women as please you, two, or three, or four, and not more. But if ye fear that ye cannot act equitably towards so many, marry one only, or the slaves which ye shall have acquired. This will be easier, that ye swerve not from righteousness
And give women their dowry freely; but if they voluntarily remit unto you any part of it, enjoy it with satisfaction and advantage
And give not unto those who are weak of understanding, the substance which God hath appointed you to preserve for them; but maintain them thereout, and clothe them, and speak kindly unto them
And examine the orphans until they attain the age of marriage: But if ye perceive they are able to manage their affairs well, deliver their substance unto them; and waste it not extravagantly, or hastily, because they grow up. Let him who is rich abstain entirely from the orphans estates; and let him who is poor take thereof according to what shall be reasonable. And when ye deliver their substance unto them, call witnesses thereof in their presence: God taketh sufficient account of your actions
Men ought to have a part of what their parents and kindred leave behind them when they die: And women also ought to have a part of what their parents and kindred leave, whether it be little, or whether it be much; a determinate part is due to them
And when they who are of kin are present at the dividing of what is left, and also the orphans, and the poor; distribute unto them some part thereof; and if the estate be too small, at least speak comfortably unto them
And let those fear to abuse orphans, who if they leave behind them a weak off-spring, are sollicitous for them: let them therefore fear God, and speak that which is convenient
Surely they who devour the possessions of orphans unjustly, shall swallow down nothing but fire into their bellies, and shall broil in raging flames
God hath thus commanded you concerning your children. A male shall have as much as the share of two females: But if they be females only, and above two in number, they shall have two third parts of what the deceased shall leave; and if there be but one, she shall have the half. And the parents of the deceased shall have each of them a sixth part of what he shall leave, if he have a child: But if he have no child, and his parents be his heirs, then his mother shall have the third part. And if he have brethren, his mother shall have a sixth part, after the legacies which he shall bequeath, and his debts be paid. Ye know not whether your parents or your children be of greater use unto you. This is an ordinance from God, and God is knowing and wise
Moreover ye may claim half of what your wives shall leave, if they have no issue; but if they have issue, then ye shall have the fourth part of what they shall leave, after the legacies which they shall bequeath, and the debts be paid. They also shall have the fourth part of what ye shall leave, in case ye have no issue; but if ye have issue, then they shall have the eighth part of what ye shall leave, after the legacies which ye shall bequeath, and your debts be paid. And if a man or woman's substance be inherited by a distant relation, and he or she have a brother or sister; each of them two shall have a sixth part of the estate. But if there be more than this number, they shall be equal sharers in a third part, after payment of the legacies which shall be bequeathed, and the debts, without prejudice to the heirs. This is an ordinance from God: And God is knowing and gracious
These are the statutes of God. And whoso obeyeth God and his apostle, God shall lead him into gardens wherein rivers flow, they shall continue therein for ever; and this shall be great happiness
But whoso disobeyeth God, and his apostle, and transgresseth his statutes, God shall cast him into hell fire; he shall remain therein for ever, and he shall suffer a shameful punishment
If any of your women be guilty of whoredom, produce four witnesses from among you against them, and if they bear witness against them, imprison them in separate apartments until death release them, or God affordeth them a way to escape
And if two of you commit the like wickedness, punish them both: But if they repent and amend, let them both alone; for God is easy to be reconciled and merciful
Verily repentance will be accepted with God, from those who do evil ignorantly, and then repent speedily; unto them will God be turned: For God is knowing and wise
But no repentance shall be accepted from those who do evil until the time when death presenteth it self unto one of them, and he saith, verily I repent now; nor unto those who die unbelievers: For them have we prepared a grievous punishment
O true believers, it is not lawful for you to be heirs of women against their will, nor to hinder them from marrying others, that ye may take away part of what ye have given them in dowry; unless they have been guilty of a manifest crime: But converse kindly with them. And if ye hate them, it may happen that ye may hate a thing wherein God hath placed much good
If ye be desirous to exchange a wife for another wife, and ye have already given one of them a talent; take not away any thing therefrom; Will ye take it by slandering her, and doing her manifest unjustice
And how can ye take it, since the one of you hath gone in unto the other, and they have received from you a firm covenant
Marry not women, whom your fathers have had to wife; -- except what is already past: -- For this is uncleanness, and an abomination, and an evil way
Ye are forbidden to marry your mothers, and your daughters, and your sisters, and your aunts both on the fathers and on the mothers side, and your brothers daughters, and your sisters daughters, and your mothers who have given you suck, and your foster-sisters, and your wives mothers, and your daughters-in-law which are under your tuition, born of your wives unto whom ye have gone in, -- but if ye have not gone in unto them, it shall be no sin in you to marry them, -- and the wives of your sons who proceed out of your loins; and ye are also forbidden to take to wife two sisters; except what is already past: For God is gracious and merciful
Ye are also forbidden to take to wife free women who are married, except those women whom your right hands shall possess as slaves. This is ordained you from God. Whatever is beside this, is allowed you; that ye may with your substance provide wives for your selves, acting that which is right, and avoiding whoredom. And for the advantage which ye receive from them, give them their reward, according to what is ordained: But it shall be no crime in you to make any other agreement among your selves, after the ordinance shall be complied with; for God is knowing and wise
Whoso among you hath not means sufficient that he may marry free women, who are believers, let him marry with such of your maid-servants whom your right hands possess, as are true believers; for God well knoweth your faith. Ye are the one from the other: Therefore marry them with the consent of their masters; and give them their dower according to justice; such as are modest, not guilty of whoredom, nor entertaining lovers. And when they are married, if they be guilty of adultery, they shall suffer half the punishment which is appointed for the free women. This is allowed unto him among you, who feareth to sin by marrying free women; but if ye abstain from marrying slaves, it will be better for you; God is gracious and merciful
God is willing to declare these things unto you and to direct you according to the ordinances of those who have gone before you, and to be merciful unto you. God is knowing and wise
God desireth to be gracious unto you; but they who follow their lusts, desire that ye should turn aside from the truth with great deviation
God is minded to make His religion light unto you: For man was created weak
O true believers, consume not your wealth among your selves in vanity; unless there be merchandizing among you by mutual consent: neither slay your selves; for God is merciful towards you
And whoever doth this maliciously and wickedly, he will surely cast him to be broiled in hell fire; and this is easy with God
If ye turn aside from the grievous sins, of those which ye are forbidden to commit, we will cleanse you from your smaller faults; and will introduce you into paradise with an honourable entry
Covet not that which God hath bestowed on some of you preferably to others. Unto the men shall be given a portion, of what they shall have gained, and unto the women shall be given a portion, of what they shall have gained: Therefore ask God of his bounty; for God is omniscient
We have appointed unto every one kindred, to inherit part of what their parents and relations shall leave at their deaths. And unto those with whom your right hands have made an alliance, give their part of the inheritance; for God is witness of all things
Men shall have the pre-eminence above women, because of those advantages wherein God hath caused the one of them to excel the other, and for that which they expend of their substance in maintaining their wives. The honest women are obedient, careful in the absence of their husbands, for that God preserveth them, by committing them to the care and protection of the men. But those, whose perverseness ye shall be apprehensive of, rebuke; and remove them into separate apartments, and chastise them. But if they shall be obedient unto you, seek not an occasion of quarrel against them; for God is high and great
And if ye fear a breach between the husband and wife, send a judge out of his family, and a judge out of her family: If they shall desire a reconciliation, God will cause them to agree; for God is knowing and wise
Serve God, and associate no creature with him; and shew kindness unto parents, and relations, and orphans, and the poor, and your neighbour who is of kin to you, and also your neighbour who is a stranger, and to your familiar companion, and the traveller, and the captives whom your right hands shall possess
for God loveth not the proud or vainglorious, who are covetous, and recommend covetousness unto men, and conceal that which God of his bounty hath given them, -- we have prepared a shameful punishment for the unbelievers
and who bestow their wealth in charity to be observed of men, and believe not in God, nor in the last day; and whoever hath Satan for a companion, an evil companion hath he
And what harm would befall them if they should believe in God, and the last day, and give alms out of that which God hath bestowed on them? Since God knoweth them who do this
Verily God will not wrong any one even the weight of an ant: And if it be a good action, he will double it, and will recompense it in his sight with a great reward
How will it be with the unbelievers, when we shall bring a witness out of each nation against itself, and shall bring thee, O Mohammed, a witness against these people
In that day they who have not believed, and have rebelled against the apostle of God, shall wish the earth was levelled with them; and they shall not be able to hide any matter from God
O true believer , come not to prayer when ye are drunk, until ye understand what ye say; nor when ye are polluted by emission of seed, unless ye be travelling on the road, until ye wash yourselves. But if ye be sick, or on a journey, or any of you come from easing nature, or have touched women, and find no water; take fine clean sand and rub your faces and your hands therewith; for God is merciful and inclined to forgive
Hast thou not observed those unto whom part of the scripture was delivered? They sell error, and desire that ye may wander from the right way
but God well knoweth your enemies. God is a sufficient patron, and God is a sufficient helper
Of the Jews there are some who pervert words from their places; and say, we have heard, and have disobeyed; and do thou hear without understanding our meaning, and look upon us: Perplexing with their tongues, and reviling the true religion. But if they had said, we have heard, and do obey; and do thou hear, and regard us: Certainly it were better for them, and more right. But God hath cursed them by reason of their infidelity; therefore a few of them only shall believe
O ye to whom the scriptures have been given, believe in the revelation which we have sent down, confirming that which is with you; before we deface your countenances, and render them as the back parts thereof; or curse them, as we cursed those who transgressed on the sabbath day; and the command of God was fulfilled
Surely God will not pardon the giving Him an equal; but will pardon any other sin, except that, to whom He pleaseth: And whoso giveth a companion unto God, hath devised a great wickedness
Hast thou not observed those who justify themselves? But God justifieth whomsoever He pleaseth, nor shall they be wronged a hair
Behold, how they imagine a lie against God; and therein is iniquity sufficiently manifest
Hast thou not considered those to whom part of the scripture hath been given? They believe in false gods and idols, and say of those who believe not, these are more rightly directed in the way of truth, than they who believe on Mohammed
Those are the men whom God hath cursed; and unto him whom God shall curse, thou shalt surely find no helper
Shall they have a part of the kingdom, since even then they would not bestow the smallest matter on men
Do they envy other men that which God of his bounty hath given them? We formerly gave unto the family of Abraham a book of revelations and wisdom; and we gave them a great kingdom
There is of them who believeth on Him; and there is of them who turneth aside from Him: But the raging fire of hell is a sufficient punishment
Verily those who disbelieve our signs, we will surely cast to be broiled in hell fire; so often as their skins shall be well burned, we will give them other skins in exchange, that they may taste the sharper torment; for God is mighty and wise
But those who believe and do that which is right, we will bring into gardens watered by rivers, therein shall they remain for ever, and there shall they enjoy wives free from all impurity; and we will lead them into perpetual shades
Moreover God commandeth you to restore what ye are trusted with, to the owners; and when ye judge between men, that ye judge according to equity: And surely an excellent virtue it is to which God exhorteth you; for God both heareth and seeth
O true believers, obey God, and obey the apostle, and those who are in authority among you, and if ye differ in any thing, refer it unto God and the apostle, if ye believe in God, and the last day: This is better, and a fairer method of determination
Hast thou not observed those who pretend they believe in what hath been revealed unto thee, and what been revealed before thee? They desire to go to judgment before Taghut, although they have been commanded not to believe in him; and Satan desireth to seduce them into a wide error
And when it is said unto them, come unto the book which God hath sent down, and to the apostle; thou seest the ungodly turn aside from thee, with great aversion
But how will they behave when a misfortune shall befall them, for that which their hands have sent before them? Then will they come unto thee, and swear by God, saying, if we intended any other, than to do good, and to reconcile the parties
God knoweth what is in the hearts of these men; therefore let them alone, and admonish them, and speak unto them a word which may affect their souls
We have not sent any apostle, but that he might be obeyed by the permission of God: But if they, after they have injured their own souls, come unto thee, and ask pardon of God, and the apostle ask pardon for them, they shall surely find God easy to be reconciled and merciful
And by thy Lord they will not perfectly believe, until they make thee judge of their controversies; and shall not afterwards find in their own minds any hardship in what thou shalt determine, but shall acquiesce therein with entire submission
And if we had commanded them, saying, slay your selves, or depart from your houses; they would not have done it, except a few of them. And if they had done what they were admonished, it would certainly have been better for them, and more efficacious for confirming their faith
and we should then have surely given them in our sight an exceeding great reward
and we should have directed them in the right way
Whoever obeyeth God and the apostle, they shall be with those unto whom God hath been gracious, of the prophets, and the sincere, and the martyrs, and the righteous; and these are the most excellent company
This is bounty from God; and God is sufficiently knowing
O true believers, take your necessary precaution against your enemies, and either go forth to war in separate parties, or go forth all together in a body
There is of you who tarrieth behind; and if a misfortune befall you, he saith, verily God hath been gracious unto me, that I was not present with them
But if success attend you from God, he will say, -- as if there was no friendship between you and him, -- would to God I had been with them, for I should have acquired great merit
Let them therefore fight for the religion of God, who part with the present life in exchange for that which is to come; for whosoever fighteth for the religion of God, whether he be slain, or be victorious, we will surely give him a great reward
And what ails you, that ye fight not for God's true religion, and in defence of the weak among men, women, and children, who say, O Lord, bring us forth from this city, whose inhabitants are wicked; grant us from before thee a protector, and grant us from before thee a defender
They who believe fight for the religion of God; but they who believe not fight for the religion of Taghut. Fight therefore against the friends of Satan, for the stratagem of Satan is weak
Hast thou not observed those unto whom it was said, withhold your hands from war, and be constant at prayers, and pay the legal alms? But when war is commanded them, behold, a part of them fear men as they should fear God, or with a greater fear, and say, O Lord, wherefore hast thou commanded us to go to war, and hast not suffered us to wait our approaching end? Say unto them, The provision of this life is but small; but the future shall be better for him who feareth God; and ye shall not be in the least injured at the day of judgment
Wheresoever ye be, death will overtake you, although ye be in lofty towers. If good befall them, they say, this is from God; but if evil befall them, they say, this is from thee, O Mohammed: Say, all is from God; and what aileth these people, that they are so far from understanding what is said unto them
Whatever good befalleth thee, O man it is from God; and whatever evil befalleth thee, it is from thy self. We have sent thee an apostle unto men, and God is a sufficient witness thereof
Whoever obeyeth the apostle, obeyeth God; and whoever turneth back, we have not sent thee to be a keeper over them
They say, obedience: Yet when they go forth from thee, part of them meditate by night a matter different from what thou speakest; but God shall write down what they meditate by night: Therefore let them alone, and trust in God, for God is a sufficient protector
Do they not attentively consider the Koran? If it had been from any besides God, they would certainly have found therein many contradictions
When any news cometh unto them, either of security or fear, they immediately divulge it; but if they told it to the apostle and to those who are in authority among them, such of them would understand the truth of the matter, as inform themselves thereof from the apostle and his chiefs. And if the favour of God and his mercy had not been upon you, ye had followed the devil, except a few of you
Fight therefore for the religion of God, and oblige not any to what is difficult, except thy self; however excite the faithful to war, perhaps God will restrain the courage of the unbelievers; for God is stronger than they, and more able to punish
He who intercedeth between men with a good intercession shall have a portion thereof; and he who intercedeth with an evil intercession shall have a portion thereof; for God overlooketh all things
When ye are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation, or at least return the same; for God taketh an account of all things
God! There is no God but He; He will surely gather you together on the day of resurrection; there is no doubt of it: And who is more true than God in what he saith
Why are ye divided concerning the ungodly into two parties; since God hath overturned them for what they have committed? Will ye direct him whom God hath led astray; since for him whom God shall lead astray, thou shalt find no true path
They desire that ye should become infidels, as they are infidels, and that ye should be equally wicked with themselves. Therefore take not friends from among them, until they fly their country for the religion of God; and if they turn back from the faith, take them, and kill them where-ever ye find them; and take no friend from among them, nor any helper
except those who go unto a people who are in alliance with you, or those who come unto you, their hearts forbidding them either to fight against you, or to fight against their own people. And if God pleased He would have permitted them to have prevailed against you, and they would have fought against you. But if they depart from you, and fight not against you, and offer you peace, God doth not allow you to take or kill of them
Ye shall find others who are desirous to enter into a confidence with you, and at the same time to preserve a confidence with their own people: So often as they return to sedition, they shall be subverted therein; and if they depart not from you, and offer you peace, and restrain their hands from warring against you, take them and kill them wheresoever ye find them; over these have we granted you a manifest power
It is not lawful for a believer to kill a believer, unless it happen by mistake; and whoso killeth a believer by mistake, the penalty shall be the freeing of a believer from slavery, and a fine to be paid to the family of the deceased, unless they remit it as alms: And if the slain person be of a people at enmity with you, and be a true believer, the penalty shall be the freeing of a believer; but if he be of a people in confederacy with you, a fine to be paid to his family, and the freeing of a believer. And he who findeth not wherewith to do this, shall fast two months consecutively, as a penance enjoined from God; and God is knowing and wise
But whoso killeth a believer designedly, his reward shall be hell; he shall remain therein for ever; and God shall be angry with him; and shall curse him, and shall prepare for him a great punishment
O true believers, when ye are on a march in defence of the true religion, justly discern such as ye shall happen to meet, and say not unto him who saluteth you, thou art not a true believer; seeking the accidental goods of the present life; for with God is much spoil: Such have ye formerly been; but God hath been gracious unto you; therefore make a just discernment, for God is well acquainted with that which ye do
Those believers who sit still at home, not having any hurt, and those who employ their fortunes and their persons for the religion of God, shall not be held equal. God hath preferred those who employ their fortunes and their persons in that cause, to a degree of honour above those who sit at home: God hath indeed promised every one paradise, but God hath preferred those who fight for the faith before those who sit still
by adding unto them a great reward, by degrees of honour conferred on them from him, and by granting them forgiveness, and mercy; for God is indulgent and merciful
Moreover unto those whom the angels put to death, having injured their own souls, the angels said, of what religion were ye? They answered, we were weak in the earth. The angels replied, was not God's earth wide enough, that ye might fly therein to a place of refuge? Therefore their habitation shall be hell; and an evil journey shall it be thither
Except the weak among men, and women, and children, who were not able to find means, and were not directed in the way
these peradventure God will pardon, for God is ready to forgive and gracious
Whosoever flieth from his country for the sake of God's true religion, shall find in the earth many forced to do the same, and plenty of provisions. And whoever departeth from his house, and flieth unto God and his apostle, if death overtake him in the way, God will be obliged to reward him, for God is gracious and merciful
When ye march to war in the earth, it shall be no crime in you if ye shorten your prayers, in case ye fear the infidels may attack you; for the infidels are your open enemy
But when thou, O prophet, shalt be among them, and shalt pray with them, let a party of them arise to prayer with thee, and let them take their arms; and when they shall have worshipped, let them stand behind you, and let another party come that hath not prayed, and let them pray with thee, and let them be cautious and take their arms. The unbelievers would that ye should neglect your arms and your baggage while ye pray, that they might turn upon you at once. It shall be no crime in you, if ye be incommoded by rain, or be sick, that ye lay down your arms; but take your necessary precaution: God hath prepared for the unbelievers an ignominious punishment
And when ye shall have ended your prayer, remember God, standing, and sitting, and lying on your sides. But when ye are secure from danger, complete your prayer; for prayer is commanded the faithful, and appointed to be said at the stated times
Be not negligent in seeking out the unbelieving people, though ye suffer some inconvenience; for they also shall suffer, as ye suffer, and ye hope for a reward from God which they cannot hope for; and God is knowing and wise
We have sent down unto thee the book of the Koran with truth; that thou mayest judge between men through that wisdom which God sheweth thee therein; and be not an advocate for the fraudulent
but ask pardon of God for thy wrong intention, since God is indulgent and merciful
Dispute not for those who deceive one another, for God loveth not him who is a deceiver or unjust
Such conceal themselves from men, but they conceal not themselves from God; for He is with them when they imagine by night a saying which pleaseth Him not, and God comprehendeth what they do
Behold, ye are they who have disputed for them in this present life; but who shall dispute with God for them on the day of resurrection, or who will become their patron
Yet he who doth evil, or injureth his own soul, and afterwards asketh pardon of God, shall find God gracious and merciful
Whoso committeth wickedness, committeth it against his own soul: God is knowing and wise
And whoso committeth a sin or iniquity, and afterwards layeth it on the innocent, he shall surely bear the guilt of calumny and manifest injustice
If the indulgence and mercy of God had not been upon thee, surely a part of them had studied to seduce thee; but they shall seduce themselves only, and shall not hurt thee at all. God hath sent down unto thee the book of the Koran and wisdom, and hath taught thee that which thou knewest not; for the favour of God hath been great towards thee
There is no good in the multitude of their private discourses, unless in the discourse of him who recommendeth alms, or that which is right, or agreement amongst men: Whoever doth this out of a desire to please God, We will surely give him a great reward
But whoso separateth himself from the apostle, after true direction hath been manifested unto him, and followeth any other way, than that of the true believers, we will cause him to obtain that to which he is inclined, and will cast him to be burned in hell; and an unhappy journey shall it be thither
Verily God will not pardon the giving Him a companion, but He will pardon any crime besides that, unto whom He pleaseth: And he who giveth a companion unto God, is surely led aside into a wide mistake
The infidels invoke beside Him only female deities; and only invoke rebellious Satan
God cursed him; and he said, verily I will take of thy servants a part cut off from the rest
and I will seduce them, and will insinuate vain desires into them, and I will command them and they shall cut off the ears of cattle; and I will command them and they shall change God's creature. But whoever taketh Satan for his patron, besides God, shall surely perish with a manifest destruction
He maketh them promises, and insinuateth into them vain desires; yet Satan maketh them only deceitful promises
The receptacle of these shall be hell, they shall find no refuge from it
But they who believe, and do good works, We will surely lead them into gardens, through which rivers flow, they shall continue therein for ever, according to the true promise of God; and who is more true than God in what He saith
It shall not be according to your desires, nor according to the desires of those who have received the scriptures. Whoso doth evil, shall be rewarded for it; and shall not find any patron or helper, beside God
but whoso doth good works, whether he be male or female, and is a true believer; they shall be admitted into paradise, and shall not in the least be unjustly dealt with
Who is better in point of religion, than he who resigneth himself unto God, and is a worker of righteousness, and followeth the law of Abraham the orhodox? Since God took Abraham for his friend
And to God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; God comprehendeth all things
They will consult thee concerning women; answer, God instructeth you concerning them, and that which is read unto you in the book of the Koran concerning female orphans, to whom ye give not that which is ordained them, neither will ye marry them, and concerning weak infants, and that ye observe justice towards orphans: Whatever good ye do, God knoweth it
If a woman fear ill usage, or aversion from her husband, it shall be no crime in them if they agree the matter amicably between themselves; for a reconciliation is better than a separation. Mens souls are naturally inclined to covetousness: But if ye be kind towards women, and fear to wrong them, God is well acquainted with what ye do
Ye can by no means carry your selves equally between women in all respects, although ye study to do it; Therefore turn not from a wife with all manner of aversion, nor leave her like one in suspense: If ye agree, and fear to abuse your wives, God is gracious and merciful
but if they separate, God will satisfy them both of His abundance; for God is extensive and wise
and unto God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth. We have already commanded those unto whom the scriptures were given before you, and we command you also, saying, fear God; but if ye disbelieve, unto God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; and God is self-sufficient, and to be praised
for unto God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth, and God is a sufficient protector
If He pleaseth He will take you away, O men, and will produce others in your stead; for God is able to do this

O true believers, observe justice when ye bear witness before God, although it be against your selves, or your parents, or relations; whether the party be rich, or whether he be poor; for God is more worthy than them both: Therefore follow not your own lust in bearing testimony, so that ye swerve from justice. And whether ye wrest your evidence, or decline giving it, God is well acquainted with that which ye do
O true believers, believe in God and his apostle, and the book which he hath caused to descend unto his apostle, and the book which He hath formerly sent down. And whosoever believeth not in God, and his angels, and his scriptures, and his apostles, and the last day, he surely erreth in a wide mistake
Moreover they who believed, and afterwards became infidels, and then believed again, and after that disbelieved, and increased in infidelity, God will by no means forgive them, nor direct them into the right way
Declare unto the ungodly that they shall suffer a painful punishment
They who take the unbelievers for their protectors, besides the faithful, do they seek for power with them? Since all power belongeth unto God
And he hath already revealed unto you, in the book of the Koran, the following passage, when ye shall hear the signs of God, they shall not be believed, but they shall be laughed to scorn. Therefore sit not with them who believe not, until they engage in different discourse; for if ye do ye will certainly become like unto them. God will surely gather the ungodly and the unbelievers together in hell
They who wait to observe what befalleth you, if victory be granted you from God, say, were we not with you? But if any advantage happen to the infidels, they say unto them, were we not superior to you, and have we not defended you against the believers? God shall judge between you on the day of resurrection; and God will not grant the unbelievers means to prevail over the faithful
The hypocrites act deceitfully with God, but he will deceive them; and when they stand up to pray, they stand carelesly, affecting to be seen of men, and remember not God, unless a little
wavering between faith and infidelity, and adhering neither unto these nor unto those: And for him whom God shall lead astray, thou shalt find no true path
O true believers, take not the unbelievers for your protectors, besides the faithful. Will ye furnish God with an evident argument of impiety against you
Moreover the hypocrites shall be in the lowest bottom of hell fire, and thou shalt not find any to help them thence
But they who repent and amend, and adhere firmly unto God, and approve the sincerity of their religion to God, they shall be numbered with the faithful; and God will surely give the faithful a great reward
And how should God go about to punisth you, if ye be thankful and believe? For God is grateful and wise
God loveth not the speaking ill of any one in public, unless he who is injured call for assistance; and God heareth and knoweth
Whether ye publish a good action, or conceal it, or forgive evil, verily God is gracious and powerful
They who believe not in God, and his apostles, and would make a distinction between God and his apostles, and say, we believe in some of the prophets and reject others of them, and seek to take a middle way in this matter
these are really unbelievers: And we have prepared for the unbelievers an ignominious punishment
But they who believe in God and his apostles, and make no distinction between any of them, unto those will we surely give their reward; and God is gracious and merciful
They who have received the scriptures will demand of thee, that thou cause a book to descend unto them from heaven: They formerly asked of Moses a greater thing than this; for they said, shew us God visibly. Wherefore a storm of fire from heaven destroyed them, because of their iniquity. Then they took the calf for their God, after that evident proofs of the divine unity had come unto them: But we forgave them that, and gave Moses a manifest power to punish them
And we lifted the mountain of Sinai over them, when we exacted from them their covenant; and said unto them, enter the gate of the city worshipping. We also said unto them, transgress not on the sabbath day. And we received from them a firm covenant, that they would observe these things
Therefore for that they have made void their covenant, and have not believed in the signs of God, and have slain the prophets unjustly, and have said, our hearts are uncircumcised; -- but God hath sealed them up, because of their unbelief; therefore they shall not believe, except a few of them
And for that they have not believed on Jesus, and have spoken against Mary a grievous calumny
and have said, verily we have slain Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the apostle of God; yet they slew him not, neither crucified him, but he was represented by one in his likeness; and verily they who disagreed concerning him, were in a doubt as to this matter, and had no sure knowledge thereof, but followed only an uncertain opinion. They did not really kill him
but God took him up unto Himself: And God is mighty and wise
And there shall not be one of those who have received the scriptures, who shall not believe in him, before his death; and on the day of resurrection he shall be a witness against them
Because of the iniquity of those who judaize, we have forbidden them good things, which had been formerly allowed them; and because they shut out many from the way of God
and have taken usury, which was forbidden them by the law, and devoured men's substance vainly: We have prepared for such of them as are unbelievers a painful punishment
But those among them who are well grounded in knowledge, and the faithful, who believe in that which hath been sent down unto thee, and that which hath been sent down unto the prophets before thee, and who observe the stated times of prayer, and give alms, and believe in God and the last day; unto these will we give a great reward
Verily We have revealed our will unto thee, as We have revealed it unto Noah and the prophets who succeeded him; and as we revealed it unto Abraham, and Ismael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and unto Jesus, and Job, and Jonas, and Aaron, and Solomon; and We have given thee the Koran, as We gave the psalms unto David
Some apostles have We sent, whom We have formerly mentioned unto thee, and other apostles have We sent, whom We have not mentioned unto thee; and God spake unto Moses, discoursing with him
apostles declaring good tidings, and denouncing threats, lest men should have an argument of excuse against God, after the apostles had been sent unto them; God is mighty and wise
God is witness of that revelation which He hath sent down unto thee; He sent it down with his special knowledge: The angels also are witnesses thereof; but God is a sufficient witness
They who believe not, and turn aside others from the way of God, have erred in a wide mistake
Verily those who believe not, and act unjustly, God will by no means forgive, neither will He direct them into any other way
than the way of hell; they shall remain therein for ever: And this is easy with God
O men, now is the apostle come unto you, with truth from your Lord; believe therefore, it will be better for you. But if ye disbelieve, verily unto God belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; and God is knowing and wise
O ye who have received the scriptures, exceed not the just bounds in your religion, neither say of God any other than the truth. Verily Christ Jesus the son of Mary is the apostle of God, and his word, which he conveyed into Mary, and a spirit proceeding from him. Believe therefore in God, and his apostles, and say not, there are three Gods; forbear this; it will be better for you. God is but one God. Far be it from Him that He should have a son! Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth; and God is a sufficient protector
Christ doth not proudly disdain to be a servant unto God; neither the angles who approach near to his presence: And whoso disdaineth his service, and is puffed up with pride, God will gather them all to Himself, on the last day
Unto those who believe, and do that which is right, He shall give their rewards, and shall superabundantly add unto them of his liberality: But those who are disdainful and proud, He will punish with a grievous punishment; and they shall not find any to protect or to help them, besides God
O men, now is an evident proof come unto you from your Lord, and We have sent down unto you manifest light
They who believe in God and firmly adhere to him, He will lead them into mercy from him, and abundance; and He will direct them in the right way to himself
They will consult thee for thy decision in certain cases; say unto them, God giveth you these determinations, concerning the more remote degrees of kindred. If a man die without issue, and have a sister; she shall have the half of what he shall leave: And he shall be heir to her, in case she have no issue. But if there be two sisters, they shall have between them two third parts of what he shall leave; and of there be several, both brothers and sisters, a male shall have as much as the portion of two females. God declareth unto you these precepts, lest ye err: And God knoweth all things
O true believers, perform your contracts. Ye are allowed to eat the brute cattle, other than what ye are commanded to abstain from, except the game which ye are allowed at other times, but not while ye are on pilgrimage to Mecca; God ordaineth that which He pleaseth
O true believers, violate not the holy rites of God, nor the sacred month, nor the offering, nor the ornaments hung thereon, nor those who are travelling to the holy house, seeking favour from their Lord, and to please Him. But when ye shall have finished your pilgrimage; then hunt. And let not the malice of some, in that they hindered you from entering the sacred temple, provoke you to transgress, by taking revenge on them in the sacred months. Assist one another according to justice and piety, but assist not one another in injustice and malice: Therefore fear God; for God is severe in punishing
Ye are forbidden to eat that which dieth of it self, and blood, and swine's flesh, and that on which the name of any besides God, hath been invocated; and that which hath been strangled, or killed by a blow, or by a fall, or by the horns of another beast, and that which hath been eaten by a wild beast, except what ye shall kill your selves; and that which hath been sacrificed unto idols. It is likewise unlawful for you to make division by casting lots with arrows. This is an impiety. On this day, wo be unto those who have apostatized from their religion; therefore fear not them, but fear Me. This day have I perfected your religion for you, and have completed my mercy upon you; and I have chosen for you Islam, to be your religion. But whosoever shall be driven by necessity through hunger, to eat of what we have forbidden, not designing to sin, surely God will be indulgent and merciful unto him
They will ask thee what is allowed them as lawful to eat? Answer, such things as are good are allowed you; and what ye shall teach animals of prey to catch, training them up for hunting after the manner of dogs, and teaching them according to the skill which God hath taught you. Eat therefore of that which they shall catch for you; and commemorate the name of God thereon; and fear God, for God is swift in taking an account
This day are ye allowed to eat such things as are good, and the food of those to whom the scriptures were given is also allowed as lawful unto you; and your food is allowed as lawful unto them. And ye are also allowed to marry free women that are believers, and also free women of those who have received the scriptures before you, when ye shall have assigned them their dower; living chastly with them, neither committing fornication, nor taking them for concubines. Whoever shall renounce the faith, his work shall be vain, and in the next life he shall be of those who perish
O true believers, when ye prepare your selves to pray, wash your faces, and your hands unto the elbows; and rub your heads, and your feet unto the ancles; and if ye be polluted by having lain with a woman, wash your selves all over. But if ye be sick, or on a journey, or any of you cometh from the privy, or if ye have touched women, and ye find no water, take fine clean sand, and rub your faces and your hands therewith; God would not put a difficulty upon you; but he desireth to purify you, and to complete his favour upon you, that ye may give thanks
Remember the favour of God towards you, and his covenant which he hath made with you, when ye said, we have heard, and will obey. Therefore fear God, for God knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
O true believers, observe justice when ye appear as witnesses before God, and let not hatred towards any induce you to do wrong: But act justly; this will approach nearer unto piety; and fear God, for God is fully acquainted with what ye do
God hath promised unto those who believe, and do that which is right, that they shall receive pardon and a great reward
But they who believe not, and accuse our signs of falsehood, they shall be the companions of hell
O true believers, remember God's favour towards you, when certain men designed to stretch forth their hands against you, but he restrained their hands from hurting you; therefore fear God, and in God let the faithful trust
God formerly accepted the covenant of the children of Israel, and we appointed out of them twelve leaders: And God said, verily I am with you: If ye observe prayer, and give alms, and believe in my apostles, and assist them, and lend unto God on good usury, I will surely expiate your evil deeds from you, and I will lead you into gardens, wherein rivers flow: But he among you who disbelieveth after this, erreth from the strait path
Wherefore because they have broken their covenant, we have cursed them, and hardened their hearts; they dislocate the words of the pentateuch from their places, and have forgotten part of what they were admonished; and thou wilt not cease to discover deceitful practices among them, except a few of them. But forgive them, and pardon them, for God loveth the beneficent
And from those who say, we are Christians, we have received their covenant; but they have forgotten part of what they were admonished; wherefore we have raised up enmity and hatred among them, till the day of resurrection; and God will then surely declare unto them what they have been doing
O ye who have received the scriptures, now is our apostle come unto you, to make manifest unto you many things which ye concealed in the scriptures; and to pass over many things. Now is light and a perspicuous book of revelations come unto you from God
Thereby will God direct him who shall follow his good pleasure, into the paths of peace; and shall lead them out of darkness into light, by his will, and shall direct them in the right way
They are infidels, who say, verily God is Christ the son of Mary. Say unto them, and who could obtain any thing from God to the contrary, if he pleased to destroy Christ the son of Mary, and his mother, and all those who are on the earth? For unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth, and whatsoever is contained between them; he createth what he pleaseth, and God is almighty
The Jews and the Christians say, we are the children of God, and his beloved. Answer, why therefore doth he punish you for your sins? Nay, but ye are men, of those whom he hath created. He forgiveth whom he pleaseth, and punisheth whom he pleaseth, and unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth, and of what is contained between them both; and unto him shall all things return
O ye who have received the scriptures, now is our apostle come unto you, declaring unto you the true religion, during the cessation of apostles, lest ye should say, there came unto us no bearer of good tidings, nor any warner: But now is a bearer of good tidings, and a warner come unto you; and God is almighty
Call to mind when Moses said unto his people, O my people, remember the favour of God towards you, since he hath appointed prophets among you, and constituted you kings, and bestowed on you what he hath given to no other nation in the world
O my people, enter the holy land, which God hath decreed you, and turn not your backs, lest ye be subverted and perish
They answered, O Moses, verily there are a gigantic people in the land; and we will by no means enter it, until they depart thence; but if they depart thence, then will we enter therein
And two men of those who feared God, unto whom God had been gracious, said, enter ye upon them suddenly by the gate of the city; and when ye shall have entered the same, ye shall surely be victorious: Therefore trust in God, if ye are true believers
They replied, O Moses, we will never enter the land, while they remain therein: Go therefore thou, and thy Lord, and fight; for we will sit here
Moses said, O Lord, surely I am not master of any except my self, and my brother; therefore make a distinction between us and the ungodly people
God answered, verily the land shall be forbidden them forty years; during which time they shall wander like men astonished in the earth; therefore be not thou solicitous for the ungodly people
Relate also unto them the history of the two sons of Adam, with truth. When they offered their offering, and it was accepted from one of them, and was not accepted from the other, Cain said to his brother, I will certainly kill thee. Abel answered, God only accepteth the offering of the pious
if thou stretchest forth thy hand against me, to slay me, I will not stretch forth my hand against thee, to slay thee; for I fear God the Lord of all creatures
I choose that thou shouldest bear my iniquity and thine own iniquity; and that thou become a companion of hell fire; for that is the reward of the unjust
But his soul suffered him to slay his brother, and he slew him; wherefore he became of the number of those who perish
And God sent a raven, which scratched the earth, to shew him how he should hide the shame of his brother, and he said, wo is me! Am I unable to be like this raven, that I may hide my brother's shame? And he became one of those who repent
Wherefore we commanded the children of Israel, that he who slayeth a soul, without adding thereto the murder of another soul, or without committing wickedness in the earth, shall be as if he had slain all mankind: But he who saveth a soul alive, shall be as if he had saved the lives of all mankind. Our apostles formerly came unto them, with evident miracles; then were many of them, after this, transgressors on the earth
But the recompense of those who fight against God and his apostle, and study to act corruptly in the earth, shall be, that they shall be slain, or crucified, or have their hands and their feet cut off on the opposite sides, or be banished the land. This shall be their disgrace in this world, and in the next world they shall suffer a grievous punishment
except those who shall repent, before ye prevail against them; for know that God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
O true believers, fear God, and earnestly desire a near conjunction with Him, and fight for his religion, that ye may be happy
Moreover they who believe not, although they had whatever is in the earth, and as much more withal, that they might therewith redeem themselves from punishment on the day of resurrection; it shall not be accepted from them, but they shall suffer a painful punishment
They shall desire to go forth from the fire, but they shall not go forth from it, and their punishment shall be permanent
If a man or a woman steal, cut off their hands, in retribution for that which they have committed; this is an exemplary punishment appointed by God; and God is mighty and wise
But whoever shall repent after his iniquity, and amend, verily God will be turned unto him, for God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
Dost thou not know that the kingdom of heaven and earth is God's? He punisheth whom he pleaseth, and he pardoneth whom he pleaseth; for God is almighty
O apostle, let not them grieve thee, who hasten to infidelity, either of those who say, we believe, with their mouths, but whose hearts believe not; or of the Jews, who hearken to a lie, and hearken to other people; who come not unto thee: They pervert the words of the law from their true places, and say, if this be brought unto you, receive it; but if it be not brought unto you, beware of receiving ought else; and in behalf of him whom God shall resolve to seduce , thou shalt not prevail with God at all. They whose hearts God shall not please to cleanse, shall suffer shame in this world, and a grievous punishment in the next
Who hearken to a lie, and eat that which is forbidden. But if they come unto thee for judgment, either judge between them, or leave them; and if thou leave them, they shall not hurt thee at all. But if thou undertake to judge, judge between them with equity; for God loveth those who observe justice
And how will they submit to thy decision, since they have the law, containing the judgment of God? Then will they turn their backs, after this; but those are not true believers
We have surely sent down the law, containing direction, and light: Thereby did the prophets, who professed the true religion, judge those who Judaized; and the doctors and priests also judged by the book of God, which had been committed to their custody; and they were witnesses thereof. Therefore fear not men, but fear me; neither sell my signs for a small price. And whoso judgeth not according to what God hath revealed, they are infidels
We have therein commanded them, that they should give life for life, and eye for eye, and nose for nose, and ear for ear, and tooth for tooth; and that wounds should also be punished by retaliation: But whoever should remit it as alms, it should be accepted as an atonement for him. And whoso judgeth not according to what God hath revealed, they are unjust
We also caused Jesus the son of Mary to follow the footsteps of the prophets, confirming the law which was sent down before him; and we gave him the gospel, containing direction and light; confirming also the law which was given before it, and a direction and admonition unto those who fear God
That they who have received the gospel might judge according to what God hath revealed therein: And whoso judgeth not according to what God hath revealed, they are transgressors
We have also sent down unto thee the book of the Koran with truth, confirming that scripture which was revealed before it; and preserving the same safe from corruption. Judge therefore between them according to that which God hath revealed; and follow not their desires, by swerving from the truth which hath come unto thee. Unto every of you have we given a law, and an open path; and if God had pleased, he had surely made you one people; but he hath thought fit to give you different laws, that he might try you in that which he hath given you respectively. Therefore strive to excel each other in good works: Unto God shall ye all return, and then will he declare unto you that concerning which ye have disagreed
Wherefore do thou, O prophet, judge between them according to that which God hath revealed and follow not their desires; but beware of them, lest they cause thee to err from part of those precepts which God hath sent down unto thee; and if they turn back, know that God is pleased to punish them for some of their crimes; for a great number of men are transgressors
Do they therefore desire the judgment of the time of ignorance? But who is better than God, to judge between people who reason aright
O true believers, take not the Jews, or Christians for your friends; they are friends the one to the other; but whoso among you taketh them for his friends, he is surely one of them: Verily God directeth not unjust people
Thou shalt see those in whose hearts there is an infirmity, to hasten unto them, saying, we fear lest some adversity befall us; but it is easy for God to give victory, or a command from Him, that they may repent of that which they concealed in their minds
And they who believe will say, are these the men who have sworn by God, with a most firm oath, that they surely held with you? Their works are become vain, and they are of those who perish
O true believers, whoever of you apostatizeth from his religion, God will certainly bring other people to supply his place, whom He will love, and who will love Him; who shall be humble towards the believers, but severe to the unbelievers: They shall fight for the religion of God, and shall not fear the obloquy of the detracter. This is the bounty of God, He bestoweth it on whom He pleaseth: God is extensive and wise
Verily your protector is God, and his apostle, and those who believe, who observe the stated times of prayer, and give alms, and who bow down to worship
And whoso taketh God, and his apostle, and the believers for his friends, they are the party of God, and they shall be victorious
O true believers, take not such of those to whom the scriptures were delivered before you, or of the infidels, for your friends, who make a laughingstock, and a jest of your religion; but fear God, if ye be true believers
nor those who, when ye call to prayer, make a laughing-stock and a jest of it, this they do, because they are people who do not understand
Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, do ye reject us for any other reason than because we believe in God, and that revelation which hath been sent down unto us, and that which was formerly sent down, and for that the greater part of you are transgressors
Say, shall I denounce unto you a worse thing than this, as to the reward which ye are to expect with God? He whom God hath cursed, and with whom he hath been angry, having changed some of them into apes and swine, and who worship Taghut, they are in the worse condition, and err more widely from the straitness of the path
When they came unto you, they said, we believe: Yet they entered into your company with infidelity, and went forth from you with the same; but God well knew what they concealed
Thou shalt see many of them hastening unto iniquity and malice, and to eat things forbidden; and woe unto them for what they have done
Unless their doctors and priests forbid them uttering wickedness, and eating things forbidden; woe unto them for what they shall have committed
The Jews say, the hand of God is tied up. Their hands shall be tied up, and they shall be cursed for that which they have said. Nay, his hands are both stretched forth; He bestoweth as He pleaseth: That which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord shall increase the transgression and infidelity of many of them; and we have put enmity and hatred between them, until the day of resurrection. So often as they shall kindle a fire for war, God shall extinguish it; and they shall set their minds to act corruptly in the earth, but God loveth not the corrupt doers
More, if they who have received the scriptures believe, and fear God, We will surely expiate their sins from them, and We will lead them into gardens of pleasure
and if they observe the law, and the gospel, and the other scriptures which have been sent down unto them from their Lord, they shall surely eat of good things both from above them, and from under their feet. Among them there are people who act uprightly; but how evil is that which many of them do work
O apostle, publish the whole of that which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord: For if thou do not, thou dost not in effect publish any part thereof; and God will defend thee against wicked men; for God directeth not the unbelieving people
Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, ye are not grounded on any thing, until ye observe the law and the gospel, and that which hath been sent down unto you from your Lord. That which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord shall surely increase the transgression and infidelity of many of them: But be not thou solicitous for the unbelieving people
Verily they who believe, and those who judaize, and the Sabians, and the Christians, whoever of them believeth in God and the last day, and doth that which is right, there shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
We formerly accepted the covenant of the children of Israel, and sent apostles unto them. So often as an apostle came unto them with that which their souls desired not, they accused some of them of imposture, and some of them they killed
And they imagined that there should be no punishment for those crimes, and they became blind, and deaf. Then was God turned unto them; afterwards many of them again became blind and deaf; but God saw what they did
They are surely infidels, who say, verily God is Christ the son of Mary; since Christ said, O children of Israel, serve God, my Lord and your Lord; whoever shall give a companion unto God, God shall exclude him from paradise, and his habitation shall be hell fire; and the ungodly shall have none to help them
They are certainly infidels, who say, God is the third of three: For there is no God, besides one God; and if they refrain not from what they say, a painful torment shall surely be inflicted on such of them as are unbelievers
Will they not therefore be turned unto God, and ask pardon of him? Since God is gracious and merciful
Christ, the son of Mary, is no more than an apostle; other apostles have preceded him; and his mother was a woman of veracity: They both eat food. Behold, how we declare unto them the signs of God's unity; and then behold, how they turn aside from the truth
Say unto them, will ye worship, besides God, that which can cause you neither harm nor profit? God is He who heareth and seeth
Say, O ye who have received the scriptures, exceed not the just bounds in your religion, by speaking beside the truth; neither follow the desires of peole who have heretofore erred, and who have seduced many, and have gone astray from the strait path
Those among the children of Israel who believed not, were cursed by the tongue of David, and of Jesus the son of Mary. This befell them because they were rebellious and transgressed
They forbade not one another the wickedness which they committed; and wo unto them for what they committed
Thou shalt see many of them take for their friends, those who believe not. Woe unto them for what their souls have sent before them, for that God is incensed against them, and they shall remain in torment for ever
But, if they had believed in God, and the prophet, and that which hath been revealed unto him, they had not taken them for their friends; but many of them are evil doers
Thou shalt surely find the most violent of all men in enmity against the true believers, to be the Jews, and the idolaters: And thou shalt surely find those among them to be the most inclinable to entertain friendship for the true believers, who say, we are Christians. This cometh to pass, because there are priests and monks among them; and because they are not elated with pride
And when they hear what has been revealed to this Messenger, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears, because of the truth which they have recognized. They say, 'Our Lord, we believe, so write us down among the witnesses
And why should we not believe in God and in the truth which has come to us, while we earnestly wish that our Lord should include us among the righteous people
So God rewarded them for what they said, with Gardens beneath which streams flow. Therein shall they abide: and that is the reward of those who do good
And those who have disbelieved and rejected Our Signs, these are they who are the inmates of Hell
O ye who believe! make not unlawful the good things which God has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Surely God loves not the transgressors
And eat of that which God has provided for you of what is lawful and good. And fear God in Whom you believe
God will not take you to task for such of your oaths as are vain, but He will take you to task for breaking the oaths which you take in earnest. The expiation thereof, then, is the feeding of ten poor persons with such average food as you feed your families with, or the clothing of them or the freeing of a slave. But whoso finds not the means shall fast for three days. That is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn. And keep your oaths. Thus does God explain to you His Signs that you may be grateful
O ye who believe! wine and the game of chance and idols and divining arrows are only the abomination of Satan's handiwork. So shun each one of them that you may prosper
Satan seeks only to create enmity and hatred among you by means of wine and the game of chance, and to keep you back from the remembrance of God and from Prayer. Then will you keep back
And obey God and obey the Messenger, and be on your guard. But if you turn away, then know that on Our Messenger lies only the clear conveyance of the Message
On those who believe and do good works there shall be no sin for what they eat, provided they fear God and believe and do good works, and again fear God and believe, yet again fear God and do good. And God loves those who do good
O ye who believe! God will surely try you in a little matter: the game which your hands and lances can reach, so that God may cause to be known those who fear Him in secret. Whoso, therefore, will transgress after this, shall have a grievous punishment
O ye who believe! kill not game while you are in a state of Pilgrimage. And whoso among you kills it intentionally, its compensation is a quadruped like unto that which he has killed, as determined by two just men from among you, the same to be bought as an offering to the Ka'bah; or as an expiation he shall feed a number of poor persons, or fast an equivalent number of days, so that he may taste the penalty of his deed. As for the past, God forgives it; but whoso reverts to it, God will punish him for his offence. And God is the Lord of retribution
The game of the sea and the eating thereof is made lawful for you as a provision for you and the travelers; but forbidden to you is the game of the land as long as you are in the state of Pilgrimage. And fear God to whom you shall be gathered
God has made the Ka'bah the Sacred House, a means of support and uplift for mankind, as also the Sacred Month and the offerings and the animals with collars. That is so that you may know that God knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and that God knows all things well
Know that God is Severe in punishment and that God is also Most Forgiving and ever Merciful
On the Messenger lies only the conveying of the Message. And God knows what you disclose and what you hide
Say, 'The bad and the good are not alike,' even though the abundance of bad may please thee. So be mindful of your duty to God, O men of understanding, that you may prosper
O ye who believe! ask not about things which, if revealed to you, would cause you trouble, though if you ask about them while the Qur'an is being sent down they will be revealed to you. God has left them out on purpose. And God is Most Forgiving and Forbearing
A people before you asked about such things, but then they became disbelievers therein
God has not ordained any 'Bahira' or 'Sa'ibah' or Wasilah' or 'Hami' but those who disbelieve forge a lie against God, and most of them do not make use of their understanding
And when it is said to them, 'Come to what God has revealed, and to the Messenger,' they say, 'Sufficient for us is that wherein we found our fathers.' What! even though their fathers had no knowledge and had no guidance
O ye who believe! take care of your own selves. He who goes astray cannot harm you when you yourselves are rightly guided. To God will you all return; then He will inform you of what you used do
O ye who believe! the right evidence among you, when death comes to one of you, at the time of making a will, is of two just men from among you; or of two others not from among you, in case you be journeying in the land and the calamity of death befalls you. You shall detain them both after Prayer for giving evidence; and if you have doubt concerning their evidence, they shall both swear by God, saying, 'We will not take for this any price, even though the person affected thereby be a near relation, nor will we hide the testimony enjoined by God; surely in that case we shall be among the sinners
But if it be discovered that the two witnesses are guilty of sin, then two others shall take their place from amongst those against whom the former two witnesses -- who were in a better position to give true evidence -- had deposed, and the two latter witnesses shall swear by God, saying, 'Surely our testimony is truer than the testimony of the former two, and we have not been unfair in any way; for then, indeed, we should be of the unjust
Thus it is more likely that they will give evidence according to facts or that they will fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths. And fear God and hearken. And God guides not the disobedient people
Think of the day when God will assemble the Messengers and say, 'What was the reply made to you?' They will say, 'We have no knowledge, it is only Thou Who art the Knower of hidden things
When God will say, 'O Jesus son of Mary, remember My favour upon thee and upon thy mother; When I strengthened thee with the spirit of holiness so that thou didst speak to the people in the cradle and when of middle age; and when I taught thee the Book and the wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel; and when thou didst fashion a creation out of clay, in the likeness of a bird, by My command; then thou didst breathe into it a new spirit and it became a soaring being by My command; and thou didst heal the night-blind and the leprous by My command; and when thou didst raise the dead by My command; and when I restrained the Children of Israel from putting thee to death when thou didst come to them with clear Signs; and those who disbelieved from among them said, 'This is nothing but clear deception
And remember My favour when I inspired the disciples saying, 'Believe in Me and My Messenger,' they said, 'We believe and bear Thou witness that we have submitted
When the disciples said, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, is thy Lord able to send down to us a table spread with food from heaven? He said, 'Fear God, if you are believers
They said, 'We desire that we may eat of it, and that our hearts may be at rest and that we may know that thou hast spoken the truth to us, and that we may be witness thereto
Said Jesus, son of Mary, 'O God, our Lord, send down to us a table from heaven spread with food that it may be to us a festival, to the first of us and to the last of us and a Sign from Thee; and provide sustenance for us, for Thou art the Best of Sustainers
God said, 'Surely I will send it down to you; but whosoever of you disbelieves afterwards -- I will surely punish them with a punishment wherewith I will not punish any other of the peoples
And when God will say, 'O Jesus, son of Mary, didst thou say to men, 'Take me and my mother for two gods beside God?' he will answer, 'Holy art Thou, I could never say that which I had no right. If I had said it, Thou wouldst have surely known it. Thou knowest what is in my mind, and I know not what is in Thy mind. It is Thou alone Who art the Knower of all hidden things
I said nothing to them except that which Thou didst command me -- Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them as long as I remained among them, but since Thou didst cause me to die, Thou, hast been the Watcher over them, and Thou art Witness over all things
If Thou punish them, they are Thy servants; and if Thou forgive them, Thou surely art the Mighty, the Wise
God will say, 'This is a day when only the truthful shall profit by their truthfulness. For them are Gardens beneath which streams flow; therein shall they abide forever. God is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him; that indeed is the supreme achievement
To God belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them; and He has power over all things
All praise belongs to God Who created the heavens and the earth and brought into being darkness and light; yet those who disbelieve set up equals to their Lord
He it is Who created you from clay and then He decreed a term. And there is another term fixed with Him. Yet you doubt
And He is God, the God, both in the heavens and in the earth. He knows what you disclose and your secrets. And He knows what you earn
And there comes not to them any Sign of the Signs of their Lord, but they turn away from it
So they rejected the truth when it came to them; but soon shall come to them the tidings of that at which they mocked
See they not how many a generation We have destroyed before them? We had established them in the earth as We have not established you and We sent the clouds over them, pouring down abundant rain; and We caused streams to flow beneath them; then did We destroy them because of their sins and raised up after them another generation
And if We had sent down to thee a writing upon the parchment and they had felt it with their hands even then the disbelievers would have surely said, 'This is nothing but manifest sorcery
And they say, 'Why has not an angel been sent down to him?' And if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided, and then they would have been granted no respite
And if We had appointed as Messenger an angel, We would have made him appear as a man; and thus We would have caused to be confused to them that which they are themselves confusing
And surely the Messengers have been mocked at before thee, but that which they mocked at encompassed those of them who scoffed at it
Say, 'Go about in the earth and see what was the end of those who treated the Prophets as liars
Say, 'To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?' Say, 'To God.' He has taken upon Himself to show mercy. He will certainly continue to assemble you till the Day of Resurrection. There is no doubt in it. Those who have ruined their souls will not believe
To Him belongs whatever exists in the darkness of the night and the light of the day. And He is All-Hearing, the All-Knowing
Say, 'Shall I take any protector other than God, the Maker of the heavens and the earth, Who feeds and is not fed?' Say, 'I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit.' And be thou not of those who associate partners with God
Say, 'Indeed I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of an awful day
He from whom it is averted on that day, God indeed has had mercy on him. And that indeed is a manifest achievement
And if God touch thee with affliction, there is none to remove it but He; and if He touch thee with happiness, then He has the power to do all that He wills
And He is supreme over His servants; and He is the Wise, the All-Aware
Say, 'What thing is the weightiest in testimony.' Say, 'God is a Witness between me and you. And this Qur'an has been revealed to me so that with it I may warn you, as well as whomsoever it reaches, of the impending punishment. What! do you really bear witness that there are other gods besides God?' Say, 'I bear not witness thereto.' Say, 'He is the One God, and certainly I am innocent of that which you associate with Him
Those to whom We gave the Book recognize him as they recognize their sons. But those who ruin their souls -- they will not believe
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against God or treat His Signs as lies? Surely the unjust shall not prosper
And think of the day when We shall gather them all together; then shall We say to those who associated partners with God, 'Where are the partners you spoke of -- those whom you asserted
Then they will have no excuse save that they shall say, 'By God, our Lord, we were not idolaters
See how they shall lie against themselves. And that which they fabricated shall fail them
And among them are some who give ear to thee; but We have put veils on their hearts, that they should not understand, and deafness in their ears. And even if they see every Sign, they would not believe therein, so much so that when they come to thee, disputing with thee, those who disbelieve say, 'This is nothing but fables of the ancients
And they forbid others to believe in it and themselves too they keep away from it. And they ruin none but their ownselves; only they perceive not
And if thou couldst only see when they are made to stand before the Fire! They will say, 'Oh, would that we might be sent back! And then we would not treat the Signs of our Lord as lies and we would be of the believers
Nay, that which they used to hide before has now become clear to them. And if they were sent back, they would surely return to that which they are forbidden. And they are certainly liars
And they say, 'There is nothing except this our present life, and we shall not be raised again
And if thou couldst only see when they are made to stand before their Lord, He will say, 'Is not this second life the truth? They will say, 'Yea, by our Lord.' He will say, 'Then taste the punishment because you disbelieved
Those indeed are the losers who deny the meeting with God, so much so, that when the Hour shall come on them unawares, they will say, 'O our grief for our neglecting this Hour!' And they shall bear their burdens on their backs. Surely, evil is that which they bear
And the life of this world is nothing but a sport and pastime. And surely the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand
We know indeed that what they say grieves thee; for surely it is not thee that they charge with falsehood but it is the Signs of God that the evil-doers reject
And the Messengers indeed have been rejected before thee, but notwithstanding their rejection and persecution they remained patient until Our help came to them. There is none to change the words of God. And there have already come to thee some of the tidings of the past Messengers
And if their turning away is hard on thee, then, if thou art able to seek a passage into the earth or a ladder unto heaven and bring them a Sign, thou canst do so. And had God enforced His will, He could surely have brought them all together to the guidance. So be thou not of those who lack knowledge
Only those can accept the truth who listen. And as for the dead, God will raise them to life, then to Him shall they all be brought back
And they say, 'Why has not a Sign been sent down to him from his Lord?' Say, 'Surely God has the power to send down a Sign, but most of them do not know
There is not an animal that crawls in the earth, nor a bird that flies on its two wings, but they are communities like you. We have left out nothing in the Book. Then to their Lord shall they all be gathered together
Those who have rejected Our signs are deaf and dumb, in utter darkness. Whom God wills He lets go astray and whom He wills He places on the right path
Say,`Will you tell me if the punishment of God come or there come upon you the Hour, will you call upon any other than God, if you are truthful
Nay, but on Him alone will you call; then will He remove, if He pleases, that which you call on Him to remove, and you will forget what you associate with Him
And indeed We sent Messengers to peoples before thee; then We afflicted them with poverty and adversity that they might humble themselves
Why, then, when Our punishment came upon them, did they not humble themselves? But their hearts were hardened all the more and Satan made all that they did seem fair to them
When they forgot that with which they had been admonished, and We opened unto them the gates of all things, till, even as they were rejoicing in what they were given, We seized them suddenly, and lo! they were in utter despair
So the last remnant of the people who did wrong was cut off; and all praise belongs to God, the Lord of all the worlds
Say, 'Will you tell me, if God should take away your hearing and your sight, and seal up your hearts, who is the god other than God who can bring it back to you?' See how We expound the Signs in various ways, yet they turn away
Say, 'Will you tell me, if the punishment of God come upon you suddenly or openly, will any be destroyed save the wrongdoing people
And We sent not the Messengers but as bearers of glad tidings and as Warners. So those who believe and reform themselves, on them shall come no fear nor shall they grieve
And those who reject our Signs, punishment will touch them, because they disobeyed
Say, 'I do not say to you: 'I possess the treasures of God, nor do I know the unseen; nor do I say to you: 'I am an angel, I follow only that which is revealed to me.' Say, 'Can a blind man and one who sees be alike?' Will you not then reflect
And warn thereby those who fear that they shall be gathered to their Lord that they shall have no friend nor intercessor besides Him, so that they may become righteous
And drive not away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His pleasure. Thou art not at all accountable for them nor are they accountable for thee. So if thou shouldst drive them away thou wilt be of the unjust
And in the like manner have We tried some of them by others, that they may say, 'Is it these whom God has favoured from among us?' Does not God know best those who are grateful
And when those who believe in Our Signs come to thee, say; 'Peace be unto you! Your Lord has taken it upon Himself to show mercy, so that whoso among you does evil in ignorance and repents thereafter and reforms, then He is Most Forgiving and Merciful
And thus do We expound the Signs that the truth may become manifest and that the way of the sinners may become clear
Say, 'I am forbidden to worship those on whom you call besides God.' Say, 'I will not follow your low desires. In that case, I shall have gone astray and I shall not be of the rightly guided
Say, 'I take my stand on a clear evidence from my Lord and you reject it. That which you desire to be hastened is not in my power. The decision rest with God alone. He explains the truth and He is the Best of Judges
Say, 'If that which you desire to be hastened were in my power, surely the matter would have been decided between me and you. And God knows best the unjust
And with Him are the keys of the unseen; none knows them but He. And He knows whatsoever is in the land and in the sea. And there falls not a leaf but He knows it; nor is there a grain in the deep darkness of the earth, nor anything green or dry, but it is recorded in a clear book
And He it is who takes your soul by night and knows what you do by day, then He raises you up again therein, that the appointed term may be completed. Then to Him is your return. Then will He inform you of what you used to do
And He is Supreme over His servants, and He sends guardians to watch over you, until, when death comes to anyone of you, Our Messengers take his soul, and they fail not
Then they are returned to God, their true Lord. Surely, His is the judgment. And He is the Swiftest of reckoners
Say, 'Who delivers you from the calamities of the land and the sea, when you call upon Him in humility and in secret, saying, 'If He deliver us from this, we will surely be of those who are grateful
Say, 'God delivers you from them and from every distress, yet you associate partners with Him
Say, 'He has the power to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet, or to confound you by splitting you into sects and make you taste the violence of one another. See how We expound the Signs in various ways that they may understand
And thy people have rejected it though it is the truth. Say, 'I am not a guardian over you
For every prophecy there is a fixed time; and soon will you come to know
And when thou seest those who engage in vain discourse concerning Our Signs, then turn thou away from them until they engage in a discourse other than that. And if Satan should cause thee to forget, then sit not, after recollection, with the unjust people
And those who are righteous are not at all accountable for them, but their duty is to admonish them that they may fear God
And leave alone those who take their religion to be a sport and a pastime, and whom worldly life has beguiled. And admonish people thereby lest a soul be consigned to perdition for what it has earned. It shall have no helper nor intercessor beside God; and even if it offer every ransom it shall not be accepted from it. These are they who have been delivered over to destruction for their own acts. They will have a drink of boiling water and a grievous punishment, because they disbelieved
Say, 'Shall we call beside God, upon that which can neither profit us nor harm us, and shall we be turn back on our heels after God guided us? -- Like one whom the evil ones entice away, leaving him bewildered in the land, and who has companions who call him to guidance, saying, 'Come to us.' Say : 'Surely, the guidance of God is the only true guidance and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds
And we have been given the command: Observe Prayers and fear Him;' and He it is Whom you shall all be gathered
And He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in accordance with the requirements of wisdom; and on the day when He will say, 'Be', it will be. His word is the truth, and His will be the Kingdom on the day when the trumpet will be blown. He is the Knower of the unseen and the seen. And He is the Wise, the All-Aware
And remember the time when Abraham said to his father, Azar, 'Dost thou take idols for gods? Surely, I see thee and thy people in manifest error
And thus did we show Abraham the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he should have full knowledge and that he might be of those who possess certainty of faith
And when the night darkened upon him, he saw a star. He said, 'Can this be my Lord?' But when it set, he said, I like not those that set
And when he saw the moon rise with spreading light, he said, 'Can this be my lord?' But when it set, he said, 'If my Lord guide me not, I shall surely be of the people who go astray
And when he saw the sun rise with spreading light, he said, 'Can this be my Lord? This is the greatest.' But when it also set, he said, 'O my people! surely I am quit of that which you associate with God
I have turned my face toward Him Who created the heavens and the earth, being ever inclined to God, and I am not of those who associate gods with Him
And his people argued with him. He said, 'Do you argue with me concerning God when He has guided me aright? And I fear not that which you associate with HIM' except that I fear what my Lord wills. My Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. Will you not them be admonished
And why should I fear that which you associate with God, when you fear not to associate with God that for which He has sent down to you no authority? Which, then, of the two parties has better title to security, If indeed you know
Those who belief and mix not up their belief with injustice -- it is they who shall have peace, and who are rightly guided
And that is Our argument which We gave to Abraham against his people. We exalt in decrees of rank whomso We please. Thy Lord is indeed Wise, All-Knowing
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob; each did We guide aright, and Noah did We guide aright aforetime, and of his progeny, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward those who do good
And We guided Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias; each one of them was of the righteous
And We also guided Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot! and each one of them did We exalt above the people
And We exalted some of their fathers and their children and their brethren, and We chose them and We guided them in the straight path
That is the guidance of God. He guides thereby those of His servants whom He pleases. And if they had worshiped aught beside Him, surely all they did would have been of no avail to them
It is to these whom We gave the Book and dominion and Prophethood. But if they are ungrateful for these favours it matters not, for We have now entrusted them to a people who are not ungrateful for them
These it is whom God guide aright, so follow thou their guidance. Say, 'I ask not of you any reward for it. This is naught but an admonition for all mankind
And they do not make a just estimate of the attributes of God, when they say, 'God has not revealed anything to any man. Say, 'Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and a guidance for the people -- though you treat it as scrapes of paper, some of which you show while you hide much thereof and you have been taught that which neither you nor your fathers knew?' Say, 'God.' Then leave them to amuse themselves with idle talk
And this is a Book which We have revealed, full of blessings, to fulfill that which preceded it, and to enable thee to warn the Mother of towns and those around her. And those, who believe in the Hereafter, believe therein and they strictly observe their Prayers
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against God, or says, 'It has been revealed to me,' while nothing has been revealed to him; and who says, 'I will sent down the like of that which God has sent down?' And if thou couldst only see, when the wrongdoers are in the agonies of death, and the angels stretch forth their hands, saying, 'Yield up your souls. This day shall you be awarded the punishment of disgrace because of that which you spoke against God falsely and because you turned away from His Signs with disdain
And now you come to Us one by one even as We create you at first, and you have left behind your backs that which We bestowed upon you, and We do not see with you your intercessors of whom you asserted that they were partners with God in your affairs. Now you have been cut off from one another and that which you asserted has failed you
Verily, it is God Who causes the grain and the date-stones to sprout. He brings forth the living from the dead, and He is the Bringer forth of the dead from the living. That is God; wherefore, then, are you turned back
He causes the break of day and He made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for the reckoning of time. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise
And He it is Who has made the stars for you that you may follow the right direction with their help amid the darkness of the land and the sea. We have explained the Signs in detail for a people who possess knowledge
And He it is Who has produced you from a single soul and there is for you a temporary resort and a permanent abode. We have explained the Signs in detail for a people who understand
And He it is Who sends down water from the cloud; And We bring forth therewith every kind of growth; then We bring forth with that green foliage wherefrom We produce clustered grain. And from the date-palm, out of its sheaths comes forth bunches hanging low. And We produce therewith gardens of grapes, and the olive and the pomegranate -- like and unlike. Look at the fruit thereof when it bears fruit, and the ripening thereof. Surely, in this are Signs for a people who believe
And they hold the jinn to be partners with God, although He created them; and they falsely ascribe to Him sons and daughters without any knowledge. Holy is He and exalted far above what they attribute to Him
The Originator of the heavens and the earth. How can He have a son when He has no consort, and when He has created everything and has knowledge of all things
Such is God, your Lord. There is no god but He, the creator of all things; so worship Him. and He is the Guardian over everything
Eyes cannot reach Him but He reaches the eyes. And He is the incomprehensible, the All-Aware
Proofs have indeed come to you from your Lord; so whoever sees, it is for His own good; and whoever becomes blind, it is to his own loss. And I am not a guardian over you
And thus do We explain the Signs in various ways that the truth may become established and that they may say, 'Thou hast read out what thou hast learnt' and that We may explain it to a people who have no knowledge
Follow that which has been revealed to thee from thy Lord; there is no god but He; and turn aside from the idolaters
And if God had enforced His will, they would not have set up gods with Him. And We have not made thee a keeper over them, nor art thou over them a guardian
And abuse not those whom they call upon besides God, lest they, out of spite, abuse God in their ignorance. Thus unto every people have We caused their doings to seem fair. Then unto their Lord is their return; And He will inform them of what they used to do
And they swear by God their strongest oaths that if there came to them a Sign, they would surely believe therein. Say, 'Surely, Signs are with God. And what should make you know that when the signs come, they will not believe
And We shall confound their hearts and their eyes, for they believe not therein the first time, and We shall leave them in their transgression to wander in distraction
And though We had sent down angels unto them, and the dead had spoken unto them, and We had gathered together before them all things in one view; they would not have believed, unless God had so pleased: But the greater part of them know it not
Thus have We appointed unto every prophet an enemy; the devils of men, and of genii: Who privately suggest the one to the other specious discourses to deceive; but if thy Lord pleased, they would not have done it. Therefore leave them, and that which they have falsely imagined
and let the hearts of those be inclined thereto, who believe not in the life to come; and let them please themselves therein, and let them gain that which they are gaining
Shall I seek after any other judge besides God to judge between us? It is He who hath sent down unto you the book of the Koran distinguishing between good and evil; and they to whom We gave the scripture know that it is sent down from thy Lord, with truth. Be not therefore one of those who doubt thereof
The words of thy Lord are perfect, in truth and justice; there is none who can change his words: He both heareth and knoweth
But if thou obey the greater part of them who are in the earth, they will lead thee aside from the path of God: They follow an uncertain opinion only, and speak nothing but lies
verily thy Lord well knoweth those who go astray from his path, and well knoweth those who are rightly directed
Eat of that whereon the name of God hath been commemorated, if ye believe in his signs
And why do ye not eat of that whereon the name of God hath been commemorated? Since He hath plainly declared unto you what He had forbidden you; except that which ye be compelled to by necessity eat of: Many lead others into error, because of their appetites, being void of knowledge; but thy Lord well knoweth who are the transgressors
Leave both the outside of iniquity, and the inside thereof: For they who commit iniquity shall receive the reward of that which they shall have gained
Eat not therefore of that whereon the name of God hath not been commemorated; for this is certainly wickedness: But the devils will suggest unto their friends, that they dispute with you concerning this precept; but if ye obey them, ye are surely idolaters
Shall he who hath been dead, and whom We have restored unto life, and unto whom We have ordained a light, whereby he may walk among men, be as he whose similitude is in darkness, from whence he shall not come forth? Thus was that which the infidels are doing, prepared for them
And thus have we placed in every city chief leaders of the wicked men thereof, that they may act deceitfully therein; but they shall act deceitfully against their own souls only; and they know it not
And when a sign cometh unto them, they say, we will by no means believe until a revelation be brought unto us, like unto that which hath been delivered unto the messengers of God. God best knoweth whom He will appoint for his messenger. Vileness in the sight of God shall fall upon those who deal wickedly, and a grievous punishment, for that they have dealt deceitfully
And whomsoever God shall please to direct, He will open his breast to receive the faith of Islam: But whomsoever He shall please to lead into error, He will render his breast strait and narrow, as though he were climbing up to heaven. Thus doth God inflict a terrible punishment on those who believe not
This is the right way of thy Lord. Now have We plainly declared our signs unto those people who will consider
They shall have a dwelling of peace with their Lord, and He shall be their patron, because of that which they have wrought
Think on the day whereon God shall gather them all together, and shall say, O company of genii, ye have been much concerned with mankind; and their friends from among mankind shall say, O Lord, the one of us hath received advantage from the other, and we are arrived at our limited term which Thou hast appointed us. God will say, hell fire shall be your habitation, therein shall ye remain for ever; unless as God shall please to mitigate your pains, for thy Lord is wise and knowing
Thus do We set some of the unjust over others of them, because of that which they have deserved
O company of genii and men, did not messengers from among your selves come unto you, rehearsing my signs unto you, and forewarning you of the meeting of this your day? They shall answer, we bear witness against our selves: The present life deceived them: And they shall bear witness against themselves that they were unbelievers
This hath been the method of God's dealing with his creatures, because thy Lord would not destroy the cities in their iniquity, while their inhabitants were careless
Every one shall have degrees of recompense of that which they shall do; for thy Lord is not regardless of that which they do
and thy Lord is self-sufficient and indued with mercy. If He pleaseth He can destroy you, and cause such as He pleaseth to succeed you, in like manner as He produced you from the posterity of other people
Verily that which is threatened you, shall surely come to pass; neither shall ye cause it to fail
Say unto those of Mecca, O my people, act according to your power; verily I will act according to my duty: And hereafter shall ye know whose will be the reward of paradise. The ungodly shall not prosper
Those of Mecca set apart unto God a portion of that which he hath produced of the fruits of the earth, and of cattle; and say, this belongeth unto God, -- according to their imaginations, -- and this unto our companions. And that which is destined for their companions cometh not unto God; yet that which is set apart unto God cometh unto their companions. How ill do they judge
In like manner have their companions induced many of the idolaters to slay their children, that they might bring them to perdition, and that they might render their religion obscure and confused unto them. But if God had pleased, they had not done this: Therefore leave them, and that which they falsely imagine
They also say, these cattle and fruits of the earth are sacred; none shall eat thereof but who we please, -- according to their imagination; -- and there are cattle whose backs are forbidden to be rode on, or loaden with burdens; and there are cattle on which they commemorate not the name of God when they slay them, devising a lie against him: God shall reward them for that which they falsely devise
And they say, that which is in the bellies of these cattle, is allowed our males to eat, and is forbidden to our wives: But if it prove abortive, then they are both partakers thereof. God shall give them the reward of their attributing these things to him: He is knowing and wise
They are utterly lost who have slain their children foolishly, without knowledge; and have forbidden that which God hath given them for food, devising a lie against God. They have erred, and were not rightly directed
He it is who produceth gardens of vines, both those which are supported on trails of wood, and those which are not supported, and palm-trees, and the corn affording various food, and olives, and pomegranates, alike and unlike unto one another. Eat of their fruit, when they bear fruit, and pay the due thereof on the day whereon ye shall gather it; but be not profuse, for God loveth not those who are too profuse
And God hath given you some cattle fit for bearing of burdens, and some fit for slaughter only. Eat of what God hath given you for food; and follow not the steps of Satan, for he is your declared enemy
Four pair of cattle hath God given you; of sheep one pair, and of goats one pair. Say unto them, hath God forbidden the two males, of sheep and of goats, or the two females; or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Tell me with certainty, if ye speak truth
And of camels hath God given you one pair, and of oxen one pair. Say, hath He forbidden the two males of these, or the two females; or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Were ye present when God commanded you this? And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie against God, that he may seduce men without understanding? Verily God directeth not unjust people
Say, I find not in that which hath been revealed unto me, any thing forbidden unto the eater, that he eat it not, except it be that which dieth of it self, or blood poured forth, or swine's flesh: For this is an abomination: Or that which is profane, having been slain in the name of some other than of God. But whoso shall be compelled by necessity to eat of these things, not lusting, nor wilfully transgressing, verily thy Lord will be gracious unto him and merciful
Unto the Jews did We forbid every beast having an undivided hoof; and of bullocks and sheep, We forbade them the fat of both; except that which should be on their backs, or their inwards, or which should be intermixed with the bone. This have We rewarded them with, because of their iniquity; and We are surely speakers of truth
If they accuse thee of imposture, say, your Lord is indued with extensive mercy; but his severity shall not be averted from wicked people
The idolaters will say, if God had pleased, we had not been guilty of idolatry, neither our fathers; and pretend that We have not forbidden them any thing. Thus did they who were before them accuse the prophets of imposture, until they tasted our severe punishment. Say, is there with you any certain knowledge of what ye alledge, that ye may produce it unto us? Ye follow only a false imagination; and ye only utter lies
Say, therefore unto God belongeth the most evident demonstration; for if he had pleased, he had directed you all
Say, produce your witnesses, who can bear testimony that God hath forbidden this. But if they bear testimony of this, do not thou bear testimony with them, nor do thou follow the desires of those who accuse our signs of falsehood, and who believe not in the life to come, and equalize idols with their Lord
Say, come; I will rehearse that which your Lord hath forbidden you; that is to say, that ye be not guilty of idolatry, and that ye shew kindness to your parents, and that ye murder not your children for fear lest ye be reduced to poverty: We will provide for you and them; and draw not near unto hainous crimes, neither openly nor in secret; and slay not the soul which God hath forbidden you to slay, unless for a just cause. This hath He injoined you that ye may understand
And meddle not with the substance of the orphan, otherwise than for the improving thereof, until he attain his age of strength; and use a full measure, and a just balance. We will not impose a task on any soul, beyond its ability. And when ye pronounce judgement observe justice, although it be for or against one who is near of kin, and fulfill the covenant of God. This hath God commanded you, that ye may be admonished
and that ye may know that this is my right way: Therefore follow it, and follow not the paths of others, lest ye be scattered from the path of God. This hath He commanded you that ye may take heed
We gave also unto Moses the book of the Law; a perfect rule unto him who should do right, and a determination concerning all things needful, and a direction and mercy; that the children of Israel might believe the meeting of their Lord
And this book which We have now sent down, is blessed; therefore follow it and fear God that ye may obtain mercy
Lest ye should say, the scriptures were only sent down unto two people before us; and we neglected to peruse them with attention
Or lest ye should say, if a book of divine revelations had been sent down unto us, we would surely have better directed than they. And now hath a manifest declaration come unto you from your Lord, and a direction and mercy: And who is more unjust than he who deviseth lies against the signs of God, and turneth aside from them? We will reward those who turn aside from our signs with a grievous punishment, because they have turned aside
Do they wait for any other than that the angels should come unto them, to part their souls from their bodies; or that thy Lord should come to punish them; or that some of the signs of thy Lord should come to pass, shewing the day of judgement to be at hand? On the day whereon some of thy Lord's signs shall come to pass, its faith shall not profit a soul which believed not before, or wrought not good in its faith. Say, wait ye for this day; we surely do wait for it
They who make a division in their religion, and become sectaries, have thou nothing to do with them; their affair belongeth only unto God. Hereafter shall He declare unto them that which they have done
He who shall appear with good works, shall receive a tenfold recompense for the same; but he who shall appear with evil works, shall receive only an equal punishment for the same; and they shall not be treated unjustly
Say, verily my Lord hath directed me into a right way, a true religion, the sect of Abraham the orthodox; and he was no idolater
Say, verily my prayers, and my worship, and my life, and my death are dedicated unto God, the Lord of all creatures
He hath no companion. This have I been commanded: I am the first Moslem
Say, shall I desire any other Lord besides God? Since He is the Lord of all things; and no soul shall acquire any merits or demerits but for itself; and no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another. Moreover unto your Lord shall ye return; and He shall declare unto you that concerning which ye now dispute
It is He who hath appointed you to succeed your predecessors in the earth, and hath raised some of you above others by various degrees of worldly advantages, that He might prove you by that which He hath bestowed on you. Thy Lord is swift in punishing; and He is also gracious and merciful
S
A book hath been sent down unto thee: And therefore let there be no doubt in thy breast concerning it; that thou mayest preach the same, and that it may be an admonition unto the faithful
Follow that which hath been sent down unto you from your Lord; and follow no guides besides Him: How little will ye be warned
How many cities have We destroyed; which our vengeance overtook by night, or while they were reposing themselves at noon-day
And their supplication, when our punishment came upon them, was no other than that they said, verily we have been unjust
We will surely call those to an account, unto whom a prophet hath been sent; and We will also call those to account who have been sent unto them
And We will declare their actions unto them with knowledge; for We are not absent from them
The weighing of mens actions on that day shall be just; and they whose balances laden with their good works shall be heavy, are those who shall be happy
but they whose balances shall be light, are those who have lost their souls, because they injured our signs
And now have We placed you on the earth, and have provided you food therein: But how little are ye thankful
We created you, and afterwards formed you; and then said unto the angels, worship Adam; and they all worshipped him, except Eblis, who was not one of those who worshipped
God said unto him, what hindered thee from worshipping Adam, since I had commanded thee? He answered, I am more excellent than he: Thou hast created me of fire, and hast created him of clay
God said, get thee down therefore from paradise; for it is not fit that thou behave thy self proudly therein: Get thee hence; thou shalt be one of the contemptible
He answered, give me respite until the day of resurrection
God said, verily thou shalt be one of those who are respited
The devil said, because thou hast depraved me, I will lay wait for men in thy strait way
then will I come upon them from before, and from behind, and from their right hands, and from their left; and thou shalt not find the greater part of them thankful
God said unto him, get thee hence, despised, and driven far away: Verily whoever of them shall follow thee, I will surely fill hell with you all
But as for thee, O Adam, dwell thou and thy wife in paradise; and eat of the fruit thereof where-ever ye will; but approach not this tree, lest ye become of the number of the unjust
And Satan suggested to them both, that he would discover unto them their nakedness, which was hidden from them; and he said, your Lord hath not forbidden you this tree, for any other reason but lest ye should become angels, or lest ye become immortal
And he sware unto them, saying, verily I am one of those who counsel you aright
And he caused them to fall through deceit. And when they had tasted of the tree, their nakedness appeared unto them; and they began to join together the leaves of paradise, to cover themselves. And their Lord called to them, saying, did I not forbid you this tree; and did I not say unto you, verily Satan is your declared enemy
They answered, O Lord, we have dealt unjustly with our own souls; and if thou forgive us not, and be not merciful unto us, we shall surely be of those who perish
God said, get ye down, the one of you an enemy unto the other; and ye shall have a dwelling place upon earth, and a provision for a season
He said, therein shall ye live, and therein shall ye die, and from thence shall ye be taken forth at the resurrection
O children of Adam, we have sent down unto you apparel, to conceal your nakedness, and fair garments; but the cloathing of piety is better. This is one of the signs of God; that peradventure ye may consider
O children of Adam, let not Satan seduce you, as he expelled your parents out of paradise, by stripping them of their cloathing, that he might shew them their nakedness: Verily he seeth you, both he and his companions, whereas ye see not them. We have appointed the devils to be the patrons of those who believe not
And when they commit a filthy action, they say, we found our fathers practising the same; and God hath commanded us to do it. Say, verily God commandeth not filthy actions. Do ye speak concerning God that which ye know not
Say, my Lord hath commanded me to observe justice; therefore set your faces to pray at every place of worship, and call upon Him, approving unto Him the sincerity of your religion. As He produced you at first, so unto Him shall ye return
A part of mankind hath He directed; and a part hath been justly led into error, because they have taken the devils for their patrons besides God, and imagine that they are rightly directed
O children of Adam, take your decent apparel at every place of worship, and eat and drink, but be not guilty of excess; for He loveth not those who are guilty of excess
Say, who hath forbidden the decent apparel of God, which He hath produced for his servants, and the good things which He hath provided for food? Say, these things are for those who believe, in this present life, but peculiarly on the day of resurrection. Thus do We distinctly explain our signs unto people who understand
Say, verily my Lord hath forbidden filthy actions, both that which is discovered thereof, and that which is concealed, and also iniquity, and unjust violence; and hath forbidden you to associate with God that concerning which he hath sent you down no authority, or to speak of God that which ye know not
Unto every nation there is a predixed term; therefore when their term is expired, they shall not have respite for an hour, neither shall they be anticipated
O children of Adam, verily apostles from among you shall come unto you, who shall expound my signs unto you: Whosoever therefore shall fear God and amend, there shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be grieved
But they who shall accuse our signs of falsehood, and shall proudly reject them, they shall be the companions of hell fire; they shall remain therein for ever
And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie concerning God, or accuseth his signs of imposture? Unto these shall be given their portion of worldly happiness, according to what is written in the book of God's decrees, until our messengers come unto them, and shall cause them to die; saying, where are the idols which ye called upon, besides God? They shall answer, they have disappeared from us. And they shall bear witness against themselves, that they were unbelievers
God shall say unto them at the resurrection, enter ye with the nations which have preceded you, of genii and of men, into hell fire: So often as one nation shall enter, it shall curse its sister, until they shall all have successively entered therein. The latter of them shall say of the former of them, O Lord, these have seduced us; therefore inflict on them a double punishment of the fire of hell. God shall answer, it shall be doubled unto all; but ye know it not
And the former of them shall say unto the latter of them, ye have not therefore any favour above us; taste the punishment for that which ye have gained
Verily they who shall charge our signs with falsehood, and shall proudly reject them, the gates of heaven shall not be opened unto them, neither shall they enter into paradise, until a camel pass through the eye of a needle; and thus will we reward the wicked doers
Their couch shall be in hell, and over them shall be coverings of fire; and thus will we reward the unjust
But they who believe, and do that which is right, -- we will not load any soul but according to its ability, -- they shall be the companions of paradise; they shall remain therein for ever
And we will remove all grudges from their minds; rivers shall run at their feet, and they shall say, praised be God, who hath directed us unto this felicity! For we should not have been rightly directed, if God had not directed us: Now are we convinced by demonstration that the apostles of our Lord came unto us with truth. And it shall be proclaimed unto them, this is paradise, whereof ye are made heirs, as a reward for that which ye have wrought
And the inhabitants of paradise shall call out to the inhabitants of hell fire, saying, now have we found that which our Lord promised us, to be true: Have ye also found that which your Lord promised you, to be true? They shall answer, yea. And a cryer shall proclaim between them, the curse of God shall be on the wicked
who turn men aside from the way of God, and seek to render it crooked, and who deny the life to come
And between the blessed and the damned there shall be a vail; and men shall stand on Al Araf, who shall know every one of them by their marks; and shall call unto the inhabitants of paradise, saying, peace be upon you: Yet they shall not enter therein, although they earnestly desire it
And when they shall turn their eyes towards the companions of hell fire, they shall say, O Lord, place us not with the ungodly people
And those who stand on Al Araf shall call unto certain men, whom they shall know by their marks, and shall say, what hath your gathering of riches availed you, and that ye were puffed up with pride
Are these the men on whom ye sware that God would not bestow mercy? Enter ye into paradise; there shall come no fear on you, neither shall ye be grieved
And the inhabitants of hell fire shall call unto the inhabitants of paradise, saying, pour upon us some water, or of those refreshments which God hath bestowed on you. They shall answer, verily God hath forbidden them unto the unbelievers
who made a laughing-stock and a sport of their religion, and whom the life of the world hath deceived: Therefore this day will we forget them, as they did forget the meeting of this day, and for that they denied our signs to be from God
And now have we brought unto those of Mecca a book of divine revelations: We have explained it with knowledge; a direction and mercy unto people who shall believe
Do they wait for any other than the interpretation thereof? On the day whereon the interpretation thereof shall come, they who had forgotten the same before, shall say, now are we convinced by demonstration that the messengers of our Lord came unto us with truth: Shall we therefore have any intercessors, who will intercede for us? Or shall we be sent back into the world, that we may do other works than what we did in our life-time? But now have they lost their souls; and that which they impiously imagined, hath fled from them
Verily your Lord is God, who created the heavens and the earth in six days; and then ascended his throne: He causeth the night to cover the day; it succeedeth the same swiftly: He also created the sun and the moon, and the stars, which are absolutly subject unto his command. Is not the whole creation, and the empire thereof, his? Blessed be God, the Lord of all creatures
Call upon your Lord humbly and in secret; for He loveth not those who transgress
And act not corruptly in the earth, after its reformation; and call upon Him with fear and desire: For the mercy of God is near unto the righteous
It is He who sendeth the winds, spread abroad before his mercy, until they bring a cloud heavy with rain, which We drive unto a dead country; and We cause water to descend thereon, by which We cause all sorts of fruits to spring forth. Thus will We bring forth the dead from their graves; that peradventure ye may consider
From a good country shall its fruit spring forth abundantly, by the permission of its Lord; but from the land which is bad, it shall not spring forth otherwise than scarcely. Thus do We explain the signs of divine providence unto people who are thankful
We formerly sent Noah unto his people: And he said, O my people, worship God: Ye have no other God than Him. Verily I fear for you the punishment of the great day
The chiefs of his people answered Him, we surely perceive thee to be in a manifest error
He replied, O my people, there is no error in me; but I am a messenger from the Lord of all creatures
I bring unto you the messages of my Lord; and I counsel you aright: For I know from God, that which ye know not
Do ye wonder that an admonotion hath come unto your from your Lord by a man from among you, to warn you, that ye may take heed to yourselves, and that peradventure ye may obtain mercy
And they accused him of imposture: But We delivered him and those who were with him in the ark, and We drowned those who charged our signs with falsehood; for they were a blind people
And unto the tribe of Ad We sent their brother Hud. He said, O my people worship God: Ye have no other God than Him; will ye not fear Him
The chiefs of those among his people who believed not, answered, Verily we perceive that thou art guided by folly; and we certainly esteem thee to be one of the liars
He replied, O my people, I am not guided by folly; but I am a messenger unto you from the Lord of all creatures
I bring unto you the messages of my Lord; and I am a faithful counsellor unto you
Do ye wonder that an admonition hath come unto you from your Lord, by a man from among you, that he may warn you? Call to mind how He hath appointed you successors unto the people of Noah, and hath added unto you in stature largely. Remember the benefits of God, that ye may prosper
They said, art thou come unto us, that we should worship God alone, and leave the deities which our fathers worshipped? Now bring down that judgement upon us, with which thou threatenest us, if thou speakest truth
Hud answered, now shall there suddenly fall upon you from your Lord vengeance and indignation. Will ye dispute with me concerning the names which ye have named, and your fathers; as to which God hath not revealed unto you any authority? Do ye wait therefore, and I will be one of those who wait with you
And We delivered him, and them who believed with him, by our mercy; and We cut off the uttermost part of those who charged our signs with falsehood, and were not believers
And unto the tribe of Thamud We sent their brother Saleh. He said O my people, worship God: Ye have no God besides Him. Now hath a manifest proof come unto you from your Lord. This she-camel of God is a sign unto you: Therefore dismiss her freely, that she may feed in God's earth; and do her no hurt, lest a painful punishment seize you
And call to mind how He hath appointed you successors unto the tribe of Ad, and hath given you a habitation on earth; ye build yourselves castles on the plains thereof, and cut out the mountains into houses. Remember therefore the benefits of God, and commit not violence in the earth, acting corruptly
The chiefs among his people who were puffed up with pride, said unto those who were esteemed weak, namely, unto those who believed among them, do ye know that Saleh hath been sent from his Lord? They answered, we do surely believe in that wherewith he hath been sent
Those who were elated with pride replied, verily we believe not in that wherein ye believe
And they cut off the feet of the camel, and insolently transgressed the command of their Lord, and said, oh, cause that to come upon us, with which thou hast threatened us, if thou art one of those who have been sent by God
Whereupon a terrible noise from heaven assailed them; and in the morning they were found in their dwellings prostrate on their breasts and dead
And Saleh departed from them, and said, O my people, now have I delivered unto you the message of my Lord; and I advised you well, but ye love not those who advise you well
And remember Lot, when he said unto his people, do ye commit a wickedness, wherein no creature hath set you an example
Do ye approach lustfully unto men, leaving the women? Certainly ye are people who transgress all modesty
But the answer of his people was no other than that they said the one to the other, expel them from your city; for they are men who preserve themselves pure from the crimes which ye commit
Therefore We delivered him and his family, except his wife; she was one of those who stayed behind
And we rained a shower of stones upon them. Behold therefore what was the end of the wicked
And unto Madian we sent their brother Shoaib. He said unto them, O my people, worship God; ye have no God besides Him. Now hath an evident demonstration come unto you from your Lord. Therefore give full measure and just weight, and diminish not unto men ought of their matters; neither act corruptly in the earth, after its reformation. This will be better for you, if ye believe
And beset not every way, threatening the passenger; and turning aside from the path of God him who believeth in Him, and seeking to make it crooked. And remember, when ye were few, and God multiplied you: And behold, what hath been the end of those who acted corruptly
And if part of you believe in that wherewith I am sent, and part believe not, wait patiently until God judge between us; for He is the best judge
The chief men of his people who were arrogant said, 'Assuredly we will drive thee out, O Shu'aib, and the believers that are with thee from our town, or you shall return to our religion.' He said, 'Even though we be unwilling
If we return to your religion after God has saved us therefrom, we would indeed admit that we had been forging a lie against God. And it behoves us not to return thereto except that God, our Lord, should so will. Our Lord comprehends all things in His knowledge. In God have we put our trust. So, Our Lord, decide Thou between us and between our people with truth and Thou art the Best of those who decide
And the chief men of his people, who disbelieved, said, 'If you follow Shu'aib, you shall then certainly be of the losers
So the earthquake seized them and in their homes they lay prostrate upon the ground
Those who accused Shu'aib of lying became as if they had never dwelt therein. Those who accused Shu'aib of lying -- it was they who were the losers
Then he turned away from them and said, 'O my people, indeed I delivered to you the messages of my Lord and gave you sincere counsel, How then should I sorrow for a disbelieving people
And never did We send a Prophet to any town but We did seize its people with adversity and suffering, that they might humble themselves
The We changed their evil condition to good until they grew in affluence and numbers and said, 'Suffering and happiness betided our fathers also, what if they befell us.' Then We seized them suddenly, while they perceive not
And if the people of those towns had believed and been righteous, We would have surely opened for them blessings from heaven and earth; but they disbelieved, so We seized them because of that which they earned
Are the people of these towns then secure from the coming of Our punishment upon them by night while they are asleep
And are the people of these towns secure from the coming of Our punishment upon them in the early part of the forenoon while they play
Are they then secure from the design of God? And none feels secure from the design of God save the people who are destined to perish
Does it not lead those, who have inherited the earth in succession to its former inhabitants, to realize that if We please, We can smite them also for their sins and seal up their hearts, so that they would not listen to words of guidance
Such were the towns some of whose news We have related to thee. And verily the Messengers came to them with clear Signs. But they would not believe what they had rejected before. Thus does God seal up the hearts of the disbelievers
And We found not in most of them any observance of covenant and, surely, We found most of them to be evil-doers
Then, after them, We sent Moses with Our Signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they unjustly rejected them. Behold, then, what was the end of those who created disorder
And Moses said, 'O Pharaoh, surely, I am a Messenger from the Lord of the worlds
It is not right that I should say anything of God except the truth. I have come to you with a clear Sign from your Lord; therefore, let the children of Israel go with me
Pharaoh replied, 'If thou hast indeed come with a Sign, then produce it, if thou art truthful
So he flung his rod and behold! it was a serpent plainly visible
And he drew forth his hand, and lo! it appeared white to the beholders
The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, 'This is most surely a skillful sorcerer
He desires to turn you out from your land. Now what do you advise
They said, 'Put him off and his brother awhile, and send into the city summoners
Who should bring to thee every skillful sorcerer
And the sorcerers came to Pharaoh and said: 'We shall, of course, have a reward, if we prevail
He said, 'Yes, and you shall also be of those who are placed near to me
They said, 'O Moses, wilt thou throw first or shall we be the first throwers
He replied, 'Throw ye.' And when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck them with awe and produced a mighty magic
And We revealed to Moses: 'Throw thy rod,' and lo! it swallowed up whatever they feigned
So was the truth established and whatever they did, proved vain
Thus were they vanquished there and they retired humiliated
And the sorcerers were impelled to fall down prostrate
And they said, 'We believe in the Lord of the worlds
The Lord of Moses and Aaron
Pharaoh said, 'You have believed in him before I gave you leave. Surely, this is a plot which you have plotted in the city, that you may turn out therefrom its inhabitants, but you shall soon know the consequences
Most surely will I cut off your hands and your feet on account of your disobedience. Then will I surely crucify you all together
They answered, 'To our Lord then shall we return
And thou does not wreck vengeance on us but because we have believed in the Signs of our Lord, when they came to us. Our Lord, pour forth upon us steadfastness and cause us to die resigned unto Thee
And the chiefs of pharaoh's people said, 'Wilt thou leave Moses and his people to create disorder in the land and forsake thee and thy gods?' He answered, 'We will ruthlessly slay their sons and let their women live. And surely we are dominant over them
Moses said to his people, 'Seek help from God and be steadfast. Verily the earth is God's; He gives it as a heritage to whomsoever He pleases of His servants and the good end is for the God-fearing
They replied, 'We were persecuted before thou camest to us and even after thou camest to us.' He said, 'Your Lord is about to destroy your enemy and make you rulers in the land, that He may see how you act
And We afflicted Pharaoh's people with years of draught and scarcity of fruits, that they might take heed
But whenever good befell them, they said, 'This is for us.' And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed the evil fortune to Moses and those with him. Now, surely, the cause of their evil fortune was with God. But most of them know not
And they said, 'Whatever Sign thou mayest bring to us to bewitch us with, we will not submit to thee
Then We sent upon them the storm and the locust and the lice and the frogs and the blood -- clear Signs; but they behaved proudly and were a sinful people
And when there fell upon them the punishment, they said, 'O Moses, pray for us to thy Lord according to that which He has promised to thee. If thou remove from us the punishment, we will surely believe thee and we will surely send with thee the Children of Israel
But when We removed from them the punishment for a term which they were to reach, lo! they broke their promise
So We took vengeance upon them and drowned them in the sea, because they treated Our Signs as lies and were heedless of them
And We caused the people who were considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof, which We blessed. And the gracious word of thy Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because they were steadfast; and We utterly destroyed all that Pharaoh and his people has built and all that they had erected
And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea and they came to a people who were devoted to their idols. They said, 'O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.' He said, 'Surely you are an ignorant people
Surely, all that these people are engaged in shall be destroyed, and vain shall be all that they do
He said, 'Shall I seek for you a god other than God, while He has exalted you above all peoples
And remember the time when We delivered you from Pharaoh's people who afflicted you with grievous torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. And therein was a great trial for you from your Lord
And We made Moses a promise of thirty nights and supplemented them with ten. Thus the period appointed by his Lord was completed -- forty nights. And Moses said to his brother, Aaron, 'Take my place amongst my people in my absence, and manage them well and follow not the way of the mischief-makers
And when Moses came at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, 'My Lord, show Thyself to me that I may look at Thee.' God replied, 'Thou shalt not see Me. But look at the mountain; and if it remains in its place, then thou shalt see Me.' And when his Lord manifested Himself on the mountain, He broke it into pieces and Moses fell down unconscious. And when he recovered, he said, 'Holy art Thou, I turn to thee and I am the first to believe
God said, 'O Moses, I have chosen thee above the people of thy time by My Messages and by My Word. So take firm hold of that which I have given thee and be of the grateful
And We wrote for him upon the Tablets about everything an admonition and an explanation of all things. 'So hold them fast and bid thy people follow the best thereof. Soon shall I show you the abode of the transgressors
I shall soon turn away from My Signs those who behave proudly in the land in an unjust manner; and even if they see all the Signs, they will not believe therein; and if they see the way of righteousness, they will not adopt it as their way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as their way. That is because they treated Our Signs as lies and were heedless of them
And those who reject Our Signs and the meeting of the Hereafter -- their works are vain. Can they expect to be rewarded for anything except for what they do
And the people of Moses made, in his absence, out of their ornaments, a calf -- a lifeless body, producing a lowing sound. Did they not see that it spoke not to them, nor guided them to any way? They took it for worship and they were transgressors
And when they were smitten with remorse and saw that they had indeed gone astray, they said, 'If our Lord have not mercy on us and forgive us, we shall surely be of the losers
And when Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said, 'Evil is that which you did in my place in my absence. Did you hasten to devise a way for yourselves without waiting for the command of your Lord?' And he put down the tablet and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards himself. Aaron said, 'Son of my mother, the people indeed deemed me weak, and were about to kill me. Therefore make not the enemies rejoice over my misfortune and place me not with the unjust people
Moses said, 'My Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Thy mercy and Thou art the Most Merciful of those who show mercy
As to those, who took the calf for worship, wrath from their Lord shall overtake them and abasement in the present life. And thus do We reward those who invent lies
And those who do evil deeds and repent and believe, surely, thy Lord after that is Most Forgiving, Merciful
And when the anger of Moses subsided, he took the tablets and in their writing there was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord
And Moses chose of his people seventy men for Our appointment. But when the earthquake overtook them, he said, 'My Lord, if Thou hadst pleased, Thou couldst have destroyed them before this, and me too. Wilt Thou destroy us for that which the foolish among us have done? This is nothing but a trial from Thee. Thou causest to perish thereby whom Thou pleasest and Thou guidest whom Thou pleasest. Thou art our Protector; forgive us then and have mercy upon us and Thou art the Best of those who forgive
And ordain for us good in this world, as well as in the next; we have turned to Thee with repentance.' God replied, 'I will inflict My punishment on whom I will; but My mercy encompasses all things; so I will ordain it for those who act righteously and pay the Zakaat and those who believe in Our Signs
Those who follow the Messenger, the Prophet, the Ummi whom they find mentioned in the Torah and the Gospel which are with them. He enjoins on them good and forbids them evil and makes lawful for them the good things and forbids them the bad things and remove from them their burdens and shackles that were upon them. So those who shall believe in him and honour and support him and help him and follow the light that has been sent down with him -- these shall prosper
Say, 'O mankind, truly I am a Messenger to you all from God to Whom belongs the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He. He gives life and He causes death. So believe in God and His Messenger, the Ummi Prophet, who believes in God and His words; and follow him that you may be rightly guided
And of the people of Moses there is a party who guide with truth and do justice therewith
And We divided them into twelve tribes, distinct peoples. And, We revealed to Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying, 'Strick the rock with thy rod;' and from it there gushed forth twelve springs; every tribe knew their drinking place. And We caused the clouds to overshadow them and We sent down for them Manna and Salwa and We said, 'Eat of the good things We have provided for you.' And they wronged Us not, but it was themselves that they wronged
And remember the time when it was said to them, 'Dwell in this town and eat therefrom wherever you will, and say, 'God! lighten our burden,' and enter the gate in humility, We shall forgive you your sins, and surely We shall give increase to those who do good
But the transgressors among them changed it for a word other than that which was said to them. So We sent upon them a punishment from heaven, because of their wrongdoing
And ask them concerning the town which stood by the sea. When they profaned the Sabbath; when their fish came to them on their Sabbath day appearing on the surface of the water, but on the day when they did not keep the Sabbath, they came not to them. Thus did We try them because they were rebellious
And when a party among them said to another party, 'Why do you admonish a people whom God is going to destroy or punish with a severe punishment?' They said, 'In order to be absolved from blame before your Lord and that they may turn to righteousness
And when they forgot all that with which they had been admonished, We saved those who forbade evil and We seized the transgressors with a severe punishment because they were rebellious
And when they insolently rebelled against that which they had been forbidden, We said to them, 'Be ye apes despised
And remember the time when thy Lord proclaimed that He would surely rise against them, till the Day of Resurrection, those who would afflict them with grievous torment. Surely, thy Lord is Quick in retribution and surely He is also Most forgiving, Merciful
And We broke them up into separate peoples in the earth. Among them are those that are righteous and among them are those that are otherwise. And We tried them with good things and bad things that they might return to good
Then there came after them an evil generation who inherited the Book. They take the paltry goods of this low world and say, 'It will be forgiven us.' But if there came to them similar goods again, they would take them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not say of God anything but the truth? And they have studied what is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand
And as for those who hold fast by the Book and observe Prayer, surely, We suffer not the reward of the righteous to perish
And when We shook the mountain over them as though it were a covering and they thought it was going to fall on them, We said, 'Hold fast that which We have given you and remember what is therein that you may guard against evil
And remember when thy Lord brought forth from Adam's children -- out of their loins -- their offspring and made them to bear witness against their ownselves saying, 'Yea, we do bear witness.' This He did lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, 'We were surely unaware of this
Or lest you should say, 'It was only our fathers who associated co-partners with God in the past and we were merely a generation after them. Wilt Thou then destroy us for what those, who lied, did
And thus do We make clear the Signs, that they may be admonished and that they may return to good
And relate to them the story of him to whom We gave Our Signs, but he stepped away from them; so Satan followed him up and he became one of those who go astray
And if We pleased, We would have exalted him thereby; but he inclined to the earth and followed his evil desires. His case, therefore, is like the case of a thirsty dog; if thou drive him away, he hangs out his tongue and if thou leave him, he hangs out his tongue. Such is the case of the people who disbelieve in Our Signs. So relate to them this narrative that they may reflect
Evil is the case of the people who treat Our Signs as lies. And it was their ownselves that they wronged
He whom God guides, is on the right path. And they whom He leaves in error, these it is who shall be the losers
Verily, We have created many of the jinn and the men whose end shall be Hell. They have hearts wherewith they understand not and they have eyes wherewith they see not and they have ears wherewith they hear not. They are like cattle; nay, they are even more astray. They are indeed altogether heedless
And to God alone belong all perfect attributes. So call on Him by these attributes. And leave alone those who deviate from the right way with respect to His attributes. They shall be requited for what they do
And of those We have created, there are a people that guide men with truth and do justice therewith
And those who reject Our Signs, We will draw them towards destruction step by step in a manner which they do not know
And I give them respite, surely My plan is mighty
Do they not consider that there is nothing of insanity about their companion? He is only a plain warner
And do they not look into the Kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all things that God has created? And do they not see that, it may be, their own term has already drawn near? Then in what thing after this will they believe
Whomsoever God adjudges astray, there can be no guide for him. And He leave such in their transgression, wandering in distraction
They ask thee about the Hour; 'When it will come to pass?' Say, 'The knowledge thereof is only with my Lord. None can manifest it at its time but He. It lies heavy on the heavens and the earth. It shall not come upon you but of a sudden.' They ask thee as if thou were well-acquainted therewith. Say, 'The knowledge thereof is only with God; but most men do not know
Say, 'I have no power to do good or harm to myself save as God please. And if I had the knowledge of the unseen, I should have secured abundance of good; and evil would not have touched me. I am only a Warner and a bearer of good tidings
He it is Who created you from a single soul and made therefrom its mate, that he might find comfort in her. And when he knows her, she bears a light burden and goes about with it. And when she grows heavy, they both pray to God, their Lord, saying, 'If thou gives us a good child, we will surely be of the thankful
But when He gives them a good child, they associate with Him partners in respect of that which He has given them. But exalted is God far above what they associate with Him
Do they associate with Him partners those who create nothing, and are themselves created
And they give them no help, nor can they help themselves
And if you call them to guidance, they will not follow you. It is the same to you whether you call them or you remain silent
Surely, those whom you call on beside God are creatures like you. Then call on them and let them answer you, if you are truthful
Have they feet wherewith they walk, or have they hands wherewith they hold, or have they eyes wherewith they see, or have they ears wherewith they hear? Say, 'Call upon the partners you associate with God, then contrive you all against me and give me no respite
Truly my Protector is God Who revealed this Book. And He protects the righteous
And they whom you call besides Him have no power to help you, nor can they help themselves
And if you invite them to guidance, they hear not. And thou seest them looking towards thee, but they see not
Do thou ever forebear, O Prophet! and enjoin kindness, and turn away from the ignorant
And if an evil suggestion of Satan assail thee, then seek refuge in God; surely, He is All-Hearing, All-Knowing
As to those who are righteous, when an evil suggestion from Satan assails them, they remember God and behold! they begin to see aright
And the brethren of the disbelievers draw them into error and then they relax not their efforts
And when thou bringest not to them a fresh Sign, they say, 'Why hast thou not forged one?' Say, `I follow only that which is revealed to me from my Lord. These are clear proofs from your Lord and guidance and mercy for a people who believe
And when the Qur'an is recited, give ear to it and keep silence, that you may be shown mercy
And remember thy Lord in thy mind humbly and fearing Him, and in a low voice in the mornings and evenings; and be not of the heedless
Truly those who are near to thy Lord, turn not away with pride from His worship, but they glorify Him and prostrate themselves before Him
They ask thee concerning the spoils. Say, 'The spoils of war are for God and the Messenger. So fear God, and set things right among yourselves, and obey God and His Messenger, if you are believers
They are only the true believers whose hearts tremble when the name of God is mentioned, and when His Signs are recited to them they increase their faith, and who put their trust in their Lord
Who observe Prayer and spend out of that which We have provided for them
These it is who are true believers. They have exalted grades of rank with their Lord, as well as forgiveness and an honourable provision
This is because thy Lord has brought thee forth from thy house for a righteous purpose while a party of the believers were quite averse to it
They (the disbelievers) dispute with thee concerning the truth after it has become manifest, as though they are being driven to death while they actually see it
And remember when God promised you one of the two parties that it should be yours, and you wished that the one unarmed should be yours, but God desired to establish the Truth by His words and to cut off the root of the disbelievers
That He might establish the Truth and bring to naught that which is false, although the guilty may dislike it
When you implored the help of your Lord, and He answered your prayer saying, 'I will surely help you with a thousand of the angels, rank on rank
And God made it only as a glad tidings so that your hearts might be at rest. But help comes from God alone; surely God is Mighty, Wise
And when He caused sleep to come upon you as a sign of security from Him, and He sent down water upon you from the clouds, that thereby He might purify you, and remove from you the uncleanliness of Satan, and that He might strengthen your hearts and make your steps firm therewith
When thy Lord revealed to the angels, saying, 'I am with you; so make firm those who believe. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Smite them above their necks, and smite off all finger-tips
That is because they have opposed God and His Messenger. And whoso opposes God and His Messenger, Then God is surely Severe in retribution
That is your punishment, taste it then; and remember that for disbelievers there is the punishment of the Fire
O ye who believe! when you meet those who disbelieve, advancing in force, turn not your backs to them
And whoso turns his back to them on such a day, unless manoeuvring for battle or turning to join another company, he indeed draws upon himself the wrath of God, and Hell shall be his abode. And an evil resort it is
So you slew them not; but it was God Who slew them. And thou threwest not when thou didst throw, but it was God Who threw, that He might overthrow the disbelievers and that He might confer on the believers a great favour from Himself. Surely, God is All-Hearing, All-Knowing
That is what happened; And know that God will weaken the design of the disbelievers
If you, O disbelievers, sort a judgment, then judgment has indeed come to you. And if you desist, it will be better for you; but if you return to mischief, We too will return to punishment. And your party shall be of no avail to you, however numerous it be, and know that God is with the believers
O ye who believe! obey God and His Messenger, and do not turn away from him while you hear his commands
And be not like those who say, 'We hear,' but they hear not
Surely, the worst of beasts in the sight of God are the deaf and the dumb, who have no sense
And if God had known any good in them, He would certainly have made them hear. And if He now makes them hear, they will turn away in aversion
O ye who believe! respond to God, and the Messenger when he calls you that he may give you life, and know that God comes in between a man and his heart, and that He it is unto Whom you will be gathered
And beware of an affliction which will surely not smite exclusively those among you who have done wrong. And know that God is Severe in requiting
And remember when you were a few and deemed weak in the land, and were in fear lest people should snatch you away, but He sheltered you and strengthened you with His help, and provided you with good things that you might be thankful
O ye who believe! prove not false to God and the Messenger, nor betray your trusts knowingly
And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that it is God with Whom is a great reward
O ye who believe! if you do your duty to God, He will grant you a distinction and will remove your evils from you and will forgive you; and God is the Lord of great bounty
And remember when the disbelievers devised plans against thee that they might put thee in confinement or slay thee or expel thee. And they planned and God also planned, and God is the Best of planners
And when Our verses are recited to them, they say, 'We have heard. If we wished we could certainly say the like of it. This is nothing but mere tales of the ancients
And remember the time when they said, 'O God, if this be indeed the truth from Thee, then rain down upon us stones from heaven or bring down upon us a grievous punishment
But God would not punish them while thou wast among them, and God would not punish them while they sought forgiveness
And what excuse have they now that God should not punish them, when they hinder men from the Sacred Mosque, and they are not its true guardians? Its true guardians are only those who are righteous, but most of them know not
And their prayer at the Sacred House is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. 'Taste then the punishment because you disbelieved
Surely, those who disbelieve, spend their wealth to turn people away from the way of God. They will surely continue to spend it; but then shall it become a source of regret for them, and then shall they be overcome. And the disbelievers shall be gathered unto Hell
That God may separate the bad from the good, and put the bad, one upon another, and heap them up altogether, and then cast them into Hell. These indeed are the losers
Say to those who disbelieve, if they desist, that which is past will be forgiven them; and if they return to their misdeeds, then verily the example of the former peoples has already gone before them
And fight them until there is no persecution and religion is wholly to God. But if they desist, then surely God is Watchful of what they do
And if they turn back, then know that God is your Protector -- an excellent protector and an excellent Helper
And know that whenever ye gain any spoils, a fifth part thereof belongeth unto God, and to the apostle, and his kindred, and the orphans, and the poor, and the traveller; if ye believe in God, and that which we have sent down unto our servant on the day of distinction, on the day whereon the two armies met: And God is almighty
When ye were incamped on the hithermost side of the valley, and they were incamped on the further side, and the caravan was below you; and if ye had mutually appointed to come to a battle, ye would certainly have declined the appointment; but ye were brought to an engagement without any previous appointment, that God might accomplish the thing which was decreed to be done, that he who perisheth hereafter may perish after demonstrative evidence, and that he who liveth may live by the same evidence God both heareth and knoweth
When thy Lord caused the enemy to appear unto thee in thy sleep, few in number; and if He had caused them to appear numerous unto thee, ye would have been disheartened and would have disputed concerning the matter: But God preserved you from this; for He knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
And when He caused them to appear unto you, when ye met, to be few in your eyes; and diminished your numbers in their eyes; that God might accomplish the thing which was decreed to be done: And unto God shall all things return
O true believers, when ye meet a party of the infidels, stand firm, and remember God frequently, that ye may prosper
And obey God and his apostle, and be not refractory, lest ye be discouraged, and your success depart from you; but persevere with patience, for God is with those who persevere
And be not as those who went out of their houses in an insolent manner, and to appear with ostentation unto men, and turned aside from the way of God; for God comprehendeth that which they do
And remember when Satan prepared their works for them, and said, no man shall prevail against you to day; and I will surely be near to assist you. But when the two armies appeared in sight of each other, he turned back on his heels, and said, verily I am clear of you: I certainly see that which ye see not; I fear God, for God is severe in punishing
When the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts there was an infirmity, said, their religion hath deceived these men: But whosoever confideth in God cannot be deceived; for God is mighty and wise
And if thou didst behold when the angels cause the unbelievers to die: They strike their faces and their backs, and say unto them, taste ye the pain of burning
This shall ye suffer for that which your hands have sent before you; and because God is not unjust towards his servants
These have acted according to the wont of the people of Pharaoh, and of those before them, who disbelieved in the signs of God: Therefore God took them away in their iniquity; for God is mighty, and severe in punishing
This hath come to pass because God changeth not his grace, wherewith He hath favoured any people, until they change that which is in their souls; and for that God both heareth and seeth
According to the wont of the people of Pharaoh, and of those before them, who charged the signs of their Lord with imposture, have they acted: Wherefore We destroyed them in their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh; for they were all unjust persons
Verily the worst cattle in the sight of God are those who are obstinate infidels, and will not believe
As to those who enter into a league with thee, and afterwards violate their league at every convenient opportunity, and fear not God
if thou take them in war, disperse, by making them an example, those who shall come after them, that they may be warned
or if thou apprehend treachery from any people, throw back their league unto them, with like treatment; for God loveth not the treacherous
And think not that the unbelievers have escaped God's vengeance, for they shall not weaken the power of God
Therefore prepare against them what force ye are able, and troops of horse, whereby ye may strike a terror into the enemy of God, and your enemy, and into other infidels besides them, whom ye know not, but God knoweth them. And whatsoever ye shall expend in the defence of the religion of God, it shall be repaid unto you, and ye shall not be treated unjustly
And if they incline unto peace, do thou also incline thereto; and put thy confidence in God, for it is He who heareth and knoweth
But if they seek to deceive thee, verily God will be thy support. It is He who hath strengthened thee with his help, and with that of the faithful
and hath united their hearts. If thou hadst expended whatever riches are in the earth, thou couldest not have united their hearts, but God united them; for He is mighty and wise
O prophet, God is thy support, and such of the true believers who followeth thee
O prophet, stir up the faithful to war: If twenty of you persevere with constancy, they shall overcome two hundred, and of there be one hundred of you, they shall overcome a thousand of those who believe not; because they are a people which do not understand
Now hath God eased you, for He knew that ye were weak. If there be an hundred of you who persevere with constancy, they shall overcome two hundred; and if there be a thousand of you, they shall overcome two thousand, by the permission of God; for God is with those who persevere
It hath not been granted unto any prophet, that he should possess captives, until he had made a great slaughter of the infidels in the earth. Ye seek the accidental goods of this world, but God regardeth the life to come; and God is mighty and wise
Unless a revelation had been previously delivered from God, verily a severe punishment had been inflicted on you, for the ransom which ye took from the captives at Bedr
Eat therefore of what ye have acquired, that which is lawful, and good; for God is gracious and merciful
O prophet, say unto the captives who are in your hands, if God shall know any good to be in your hearts, He will give you better than what hath been taken from you; and He will forgive you, for God is gracious and merciful
But if they seek to deceive thee, verily they have deceived God before; wherefore He hath given thee power over them: And God is knowing and wise
Moreover they who have believed, and have fled their country, and employed their substance and their persons in fighting for the religion of God, and they who have given the prophet a refuge among them, and have assisted him, these shall be deemed the one nearest of kin to the other. But they who have believed, but have not fled their country, shall have no right of kindred at all with you, until they also fly. Yet if they ask assistance of you on account of religion, it belongeth unto you to give them assistance; except against a people between whom and yourselves there shall be a league subsisting: And God seeth that which ye do
And as to the infidels, let them be deemed of kin the one to the other. Unless ye do this, there will be a sedition in the earth, and grievous corruption
But as for them who have believed, and left their country, and have fought for God's true religion, and who have allowed the prophet a retreat among them, and have assisted him, these are really believers; they shall receive mercy, and an honourable provision
And they who have believed since, and have fled their country, and have fought with you, these also are of you. And those who are related by consanguinity shall be deemed the nearest of kin to each other, preferably to strangers, according to the book of God; God knoweth all things
A declaration of immunity from God and his apostle, unto the idolaters with whom ye have entered into league
Go to and fro in the earth securely four months; and know that ye shall not weaken God, and that God will disgrace the unbelievers
And a declaration from God and his apostle unto the people, on the day of the greater pilgrimage, that God is clear of the idolaters, and his apostle also. Wherefore if ye repent, this will be better for you; but if ye turn back, know that ye shall not weaken God: And denounce unto those who believe not, a painful punishment
Except such of the idolaters with whom ye shall have entered into a league, and who afterwards shall not fail you in any instance, nor assist any other against you. Wherefore perform the covenant which ye shall have made with them, until their time shall be elapsed; for God loveth those who fear him
And when the months wherein ye are not allowed to attack them shall be past, kill the idolaters wheresoever ye shall find them, and take them prisoners, and besiege them, and lay wait for them in every convenient place. But if they shall repent, and observe the appointed times of prayer, and pay the legal alms, dismiss them freely; for God is gracious and merciful
And if any of the idolaters shall demand protection of thee, grant him protection, that he may hear the word of God; and afterwards let him reach the place of his security. This shalt thou do, because they are people which know not the excellency of the religion thou preachest
How shall the idolaters be admitted into a league with God and with his apostle; except those with whom ye entered into a league at the holy temple? So long as they behave with fidelity towards you, do ye also behave with fidelity towards them; for God loveth those who fear him
How can they be admitted into a league with you, since, if they prevail against you, they will not regard in you either consanguinity or faith? They will please you with their mouths, but their hearts will be averse from you; for the greater part of them are wicked doers
They sell the signs of God for a small price, and obstruct his way; it is certainly evil which they do
They regard not in a believer either consanguinity or faith; and these are the transgressors
Yet if they repent, and observe the appointed times of prayer, and give alms, they shall be deemed your brethren in religion. We distinctly propound our signs unto people who understand
But if they violate their oaths, after their league, and revile your religion, oppose the leaders of infidelity, -- for there is no trust in them, -- that they may desist from their treachery
Will ye not fight against people who have violated their oaths, and conspired to expel the apostle of God; and who of their own accord assaulted you the first time? Will ye fear them? But it is more just that ye should fear God, if ye are true believers
Attack them therefore; God shall punish them by your hands, and will cover them with shame, and will give you the victory over them; and He will heal the breasts of the people who believe
and will take away the indignation of their hearts: For God will be turned unto whom He pleaseth; and God is knowing and wise
Did ye imagine that ye should be abandoned, whereas God did not yet know those among you who fought for his religion, and took not any besides God, and his apostle, and the faithful for their friends? God is well acquainted with that which ye do
It is not fitting that the idolaters should visit the temples of God, being witnesses against their own souls of their infidelity. The works of these men are vain; and they shall remain in hell fire for ever
But he only shall visit the temples of God, who believeth in God and the last day, and is constant at prayer, and payeth the legal alms, and feareth God alone. These perhaps may become of the number of those who are rightly directed
Do ye reckon the giving drink to the pilgrims, and the visiting of the holy temple to be actions as meritorious as those performed by him who believeth in God and the last day, and fighteth for the religion of God? They shall not be held equal with God: For God directeth not the unrighteous people
They who have believed, and fled their country, and employed their substance and their persons in the defence of God's true religion, shall be in the highest degree of honour with God; and these are they who shall be happy
Their Lord sendeth them good tidings of mercy from Him, and good will, and of gardens wherein they shall enjoy lasting pleasure
they shall continue therein for ever: For with God is a great reward
O true believers, take not your fathers or your brethren for friends, if they love infidelity above faith; and whosoever among you shall take them for his friends, they will be unjust doers
Say, if your fathers, and your sons, and your brethren, and your wives, and your relations, and your substance which ye have acquired, and your merchandize which ye apprehend may not be sold off, and your dwellings wherein ye delight, be more dear unto you than God, and his apostle, and the advancement of his religion; wait, until God shall send his command: For God directeth not the ungodly people
Now hath God assisted you in many engagements, and particularly at the battle of Honein; when ye pleased your selves in your multitude, but it was no manner of advantage unto you, and the earth became too strait for you, notwithstanding it was spacious; then did ye retreat and turn your backs
Afterwards God sent down his security upon his apostle and upon the faithful, and sent down troops of angels which ye saw not; and he punished those who disbelieved: And this was the reward of the unbelievers
Nevertheless God will hereafter be turned unto whom He pleaseth; for God is gracious and merciful
O true believers, verily the idolaters are unclean; let them not therefore come near unto the holy temple after this year. And if ye fear want, by the cutting off trade and communication with them, God will enrich you of his abundance, if He pleaseth; for God is knowing and wise
Fight against them who believe not in God, nor in the last day, and forbid not that which God and his apostle have forbidden, and profess not the true religion, of those unto whom the scriptures have been delivered, until they pay tribute by right of subjection, and they be reduced low
The Jews say, Ezra is the son of God: And the Christians say Christ is the son of God. They say this (only) with their mouths: They imitate the saying of those who were unbelievers in former times. May God curse them (literally: fight against them)! How can they be so infatuated
They take their priests and their monks for their lords, besides God, and Christ the son of Mary; although they are commanded to worship one God only: There is no God but He; far be that from Him, which they associate with Him
They seek to extinguish the light of God with their mouths; but God willeth no other than to perfect his light, although the infidels be averse thereto
It is He who hath sent his apostle with the direction, and true religion: That He may cause it to appear superior to every other religion; although the idolaters be averse thereto
O true believers, verily many of the priests and monks devour the substance of men in vanity, and obstruct the way of God. But unto whose who treasure up gold and silver, and employ it not for the advancement of God's true religion, denounce a grievous punishment
On the day of judgment their treasures shall be intensely heated in the fire of hell, and their foreheads, and their sides, and their backs shall be stigmatized therewith; and their tormentors shall say, this is what ye have treasured up for your souls; taste therefore that which ye have treasured up
Moreover, the complete number of months with God, is twelve months, which were ordained in the book of God, on the day whereon He created the heavens and the earth: Of these, four are sacred. This is the right religion: Therefore deal not unjustly with your selves therein. But attack the idolaters in all the months, as they attack you in all; and know that God is with those who fear Him
Verily the transferring of a sacred month to another month, is an additional infidelity. The unbelievers are led into an error thereby: They allow a month to be violated one year, and declare it sacred another year, that they may agree in the number of months which God hath commanded to be kept sacred; and they allow that which God hath forbidden. The evil of their actions hath been prepared for them: For God directeth not the unbelieving people
O true believers, what ailed you, that, when it was said unto you, go forth to fight for the religion of God, ye inclined heavily towards the earth? Do ye prefer the present life to that which is to come? But the provision of this life, in respect of that which is to come, is but slender
Unless ye go forth when ye are summoned to war, God will punish you with a grievous punishment; and He will place another people in your stead, and ye shall not hurt him at all; for God is almighty
If ye assist not the prophet, verily God will assist him, as he assisted him formerly, when the unbelievers drove him out of Mecca, the second of two: When they were both in the cave; when he said unto his companion, be not grieved, for God is with us. And God sent down his security upon him, and strenghtened him with armies of angels, whom ye saw not. And He made the word of those who believed not, to be abased, and the word of God was exalted; for God is mighty and wise
Go forth to battle, both light, and heavy, and employ your substance and your persons for the advancement of God's religion. This will be better for you; if ye know it
If it had been a near advantage, and a moderate journey, they had surely followed thee; but the way seemed tedious unto them: And yet they will swear by God, saying, if we had been able, we had surely gone forth with you. They destroy their own souls; for God knoweth that they are liars
God forgive thee! Why didst thou give them leave to stay at home, until they who speak the truth, when they excuse themselves, had become manifested unto thee, and thou hadst known the liars
They who believe in God and the last day, will not ask leave of thee, to be excused from employing their substance and their persons for the advancement of God's true religion; and God knoweth those who fear him
Verily they only will ask leave of thee to stay behind, who believe not in God and the last day, and whose hearts doubt concerning the faith: Wherefore they are tossed to and fro in their doubting
If they had been willing to go forth with thee, they had certainly prepared for that purpose a provision of arms and necessaries: But God was averse to their going forth; wherefore He rendered them slothful, and it was said unto them, sit ye still with those who sit still
If they had gone forth with you, they had only been a burden unto you, and had run to and fro between you, stirring you up to sedition; and there would have been some among you, who would have given ear unto them: An God knoweth the wicked
They formerly sought to raise a sedition, and they disturbed thy affairs, until the truth came, and the decree of God was made manifest; although they were averse thereto
There is of them who saith unto thee, give me leave to stay behind, and expose me not to temptation. Have they not fallen into temptation at home? But hell will surely encompass the unbelievers
If good happen unto thee, it grieveth them: But if a misfortune befall thee, they say, we ordered our business before; and they turn their backs, and rejoice at thy mishap
Say, nothing shall befall us, but what God hath decreed for us: He is our patron; and on God let the faithful trust
Say, do ye expect any other should befall us, than one of the two most excellent things; either victory or martyrdom? But we expect concerning you, that God inflict a punishment on you, either from himslef, or by our hands. Wait therefore to see what will be the end of both; for we will wait with you
Say, expend your money in pious uses, either voluntarily, or by constraint, it shall not be accepted of you; because ye are wicked people
And nothing hindreth their contributions from being accepted of them, but that they believe not in God and his apostle, and perform not the duty of prayer, otherwise than sluggishly; and expend not their money for God's service, otherwise than unwillingly
Let not therefore their riches, or their children cause thee to marvel. Verily God intendeth only to punish them by these things in this world; and that their souls may depart while they are unbelievers
They swear by God that they are of you; yet they are not of you, but are people who stand in fear
If they find a place of refuge, or caves, or a retreating hole, they surely turn towards the same, and in a headstrong manner haste thereto
There is of them also who spreadeth ill reports of thee, in relation to thy distribution of the alms: Yet if they receive part thereof, they are well pleased; but if they receive not a part thereof, behold, they are angry
But if they had been pleased with that which God and his apostle had given them, and had said, God is our support; God will give unto us of his abundance and his prophet also; verily unto God do we make our supplications: It would have been more decent
Alms are to be distributed only unto the poor, and the needy, and those who are employed in collecting and distributing the same, and unto those whose hearts are reconciled, and for the redemption of captives, and unto those who are in debt and insolvent, and for the advancement of God's religion, and unto the traveller. This is an ordinance from God: And God is knowing and wise
There are some of them who injure the prophet, and say, he is an ear: Answer, he is an ear of good unto you; he believeth in God, and giveth credit to the faithful, and is a mercy unto such of you who believe. But they who injure the apostle of God, shall suffer a painful punishment
They swear unto you by God, that they may please you; but it is more just that they should please God and his apostle, if they are true believers
Do they not know that he who opposeth God and his apostle, shall without doubt be punished with the fire of hell; and shall remain therein for ever? This will be great ignominy
The hypocrites are apprehensive lest a sura should be revealed concerning them, to declare unto them that which is in their hearts. Say unto them, scoff ye; but God will surely bring to light that which ye fear should be discovered
And if thou ask them the reason of this scoffing, they say, verily we were only engaged in discourse, and jesting among ourselves. Say, do ye scoff at God and his signs, and at his apostle
Offer not an excuse: Now are ye become infidels, after your faith. If we forgive a part of you, we will punish a part, for that they have been wicked doers
Hypocritical men and women are the one of them of the other: They command that which is evil, and forbid that which is just, and shut their hands from giving alms. They have forgotten God; wherefore He hath forgotten them: Verily the hypocrites are those who act wickedly
God denounceth unto the hypocrites, both men and women, and to the unbelievers, the fire of hell; they shall remain therein for ever: This will be their sufficient reward; God hath cursed them, and they shall endure a lasting torment
As they who have been before you, so are ye. They were superior to you in strength, and had more abundance of wealth and of children; and they enjoyed their portion in this world; and ye also enjoy your portion here, as they who have preceded you, enjoyed their portion. And ye engage your selves in vain discourses, like unto those wherein they engaged themselves. The works of these are vain both in this world, and in that which is to come; and these are they who perish
Have they not been acquainted with the history of those who have been before them? Of the people of Noah, and of Ad, and of Thamud, and of the people of Abraham, and of the inhabitants of Madian, and of the cities which were overthrown? Their apostles came unto them with evident demonstrations: And God was not disposed to treat them unjustly; but they dealt unjustly with their own souls
And the faithful men, and the faithful women are friends one to another: They command that which is just, and they forbid that which is evil; and they are constant at prayer, and pay their appointed alms; and they obey God, and his apostle: Unto these will God be merciful; for He is mighty and wise
God promiseth unto the true believers, both men and women, gardens through which rivers flow, wherein they shall remain for ever; and delicious dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode: But good will from God shall be their most excellent reward. This will be great felicity
O prophet, wage war against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and be severe unto them: For their dwelling shall be hell; an unhappy journey shall it be thither
They swear by God that they said not what they are charged with: Yet they spake the word of infidelity, and became unbelievers, after they had embraced Islam. And they designed that which they could not effect; and they did not disapprove the design for any other reason, than because God and his apostle had inriched them, of his bounty. If they repent, it will be better for them; but if they relapse, God will punish them with a grievous torment, in this world and in the next; and they shall have no patron on earth, nor any protector
There are some of them who made a covenant with God, saying, verily if He give us of his abundance, we will give alms, and become righteous people
Yet when He had given unto them of his abundance, they became covetous thereof, and turned back, and retired afar off
Wherefore He hath caused hypocrisy to succeed in their hearts, until the day whereon they shall meet Him; for that they failed to perform unto God that which they had promised Him, and for that they prevaricated
Do they not know that God knoweth whatever they conceal, and their private discourses; and that God is the knower of secrets
They who traduce such of the believers as are liberal in giving alms beyond what they are obliged, and those who find nothing to give, but what they gain by their industry; and therefore scoff at them: God shall scoff at them, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment
Ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them; it will be equal. If thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times, God will by no means forgive them. This is the divine pleasure, for that they believe not in God, and his apostle; and God directeth not the ungodly people
They who were left at home in he expedition of Tabuc, were glad of their staying behind the apostle of God, and were unwilling to employ their substance and their persons for the advancement of God's true religion; and they said, go not forth in the heat. Say, the fire of hell will be hotter; if they understood this
Wherefore let them laugh little, and weep much, as a reward for that which they have done
If God bring thee back unto some of them, and they ask thee leave to go forth to war with thee, say, ye shall not go forth with me for the future, neither shall ye fight an enemy with me; ye were pleased with sitting at home the first time; sit ye at home therefore with those who stay behind
Neither do thou ever pray over any of them who shall die, neither stand at his grave; for that they believed not in God and his apostle, and die in their wickedness
Let not their riches or their children cause thee to marvel: For God intendeth only to punish them therewith in this world; and that their souls may depart, while they are infidels
When a sura is sent down, wherein it is said, believe in God, and go forth to war with his apostle; those who are in plentiful circumstances among them ask leave of thee to stay behind, and say, suffer us to be of the number of those who sit at home
They are well pleased to be with those who stay behind, and their hearts are sealed up; wherefore they do not understand
But the apostle, and those who have believed with him, expose their fortunes and their lives for God's service; they shall enjoy the good things of either life, and they shall be happy
God hath prepared for them gardens through which rivers flow; they shall remain therein for ever. This will be great felicity
And certain Arabs of the desert came to excuse themselves, praying that they might be permitted to stay behind; and they sat at home who had renounced God and his apostle. But a painful punishment shall be inflicted on such of them as believe not
In those who are weak, or are afflicted with sickness, or in those who find not wherewith to contribute to the war, it shall be no crime if they stay at home; provided they behave themselves faithfully towards God and his apostle. There is no room to lay blame on the righteous; for God is gracious and merciful
Nor on those, unto whom, when they came unto thee, requesting that thou wouldest supply them with necessaries for travelling, thou didst answer, I find not wherewith to supply you, returned, their eyes shedding tears for grief, that they found not wherewith to contribute to the expedition
But there is reason to blame those who ask leave of thee to sit at home, when they are rich. They are pleased to be with those who stay behind, and God hath sealed up their hearts; wherefore they do not understand
They will excuse themselves unto you, when ye are returned unto them. Say, excuse not your selves; we will by no means believe you: God hath acquainted us with your behaviour; and God will observe your actions, and his apostle also: And hereafter shall ye be brought before Him who knoweth that which is hidden, and that which is manifest; and He will declare unto you that which ye have done
They will swear unto you by God, when ye are returned unto them, that ye may let them alone. Let them alone therefore, for they are an abomination, and their dwelling shall be hell, a reward for that which they have deserved
They will swear unto you, that ye may be well pleased with them; but if ye be well pleased with them, verily God will not be well pleased with people who prevaricate
The Arabs of the desert are more obstinate in their unbelief and hypocrisy; and it is easier for them to be ignorant of the ordinances of that which God hath sent down unto his apostle: And God is knowing and wise
Of the Arabs of the desert there is who reckoneth that which he expendeth for the service of God, to be as tribute; and waiteth that some change of fortune may befall you. A change for evil shall happen unto them; for God both heareth and knoweth
And of the Arabs of desert there is who believeth in God, and in the last day; and esteemeth that which he layeth out for the service of God to be the means of bringing him near unto God, and the prayers of the apostle. Is it not unto them the means of a near approach? God shall lead them into his mercy; for God is gracious and merciful
As for the leaders and the first of the Mohajerin, and the Ansars, and those who have followed them in well doing; God is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased in him: And He hath prepared for them gardens watered by rivers; they shall remain therein for ever. This shall be great felicity
And of the Arabs of the desert who dwell round about you, there are hypocritical persons: And of the inhabitants of Medina there are some who are obstinate in hypocrisy. Thou knowest them not, O prophet, but We know them: We will surely punish them twice; afterwards shall they be sent to a grievous torment
And others have acknowledged their crimes. They have mixed a good action with another which is bad: Peradventure God will be turned unto them; for God is gracious and merciful
Take alms of their substance, that thou mayest cleanse them, and purify them thereby; and pray for them; For thy prayers shall be a security of mind unto them; and God both heareth and knoweth
Do they not know that God accepteth repentance from his servants, and accepteth alms; and that God is easy to be reconciled, and merciful
Say unto them, work as ye will; but God will behold your work, and his apostle also, and the true believers: And ye shall be brought before Him who knoweth that which is kept secret, and that which is made public; and He will declare unto you whatever ye have done
And there are others who wait with suspense the decree of God; whether He will punish them, or whether He will be turned unto them: But God is knowing and wise
There are some who have built a temple to hurt the faithful, and to propagate infidelity, and to foment division among the true believers, and for a lurking place for him who hath fought against God and his apostle in time past; and they swear, saying, verily we intended no other than to do for the best: But God is witness that they do certainly lie
Stand not up to pray therein for ever. There is a temple founded on piety, from the first day of its building. It is more just that thou stand up to pray therein: Therein are men who love to be purified; for God loveth the clean
Whether therefore is he better, who hath founded his building on the fear of God and his good will; or he who hath founded his building on the brink of a bank of earth which is washed away by waters, so that it falleth with him into the fire of hell? God directeth not the ungodly people
Their building which they have built will not cease to be an occasion of doubting in their hearts, until their hearts be cut in pieces; and God is knowing and wise
Verily God hath purchased of the true believers their souls, and their substance, promising them the enjoyment of paradise; on condition that they fight for the cause of God: Whether they slay or be slain, the promise for the same is assuredly due by the law, and the gospel, and the Koran. And who performeth his contract more faithfully than God? Rejoice therefore in the contract which ye have made. This shall be great happiness
The penitent, and those who serve God, and praise him, and who fast, and bow down, and worship; and who command that which is just, and forbid that which is evil, and keep the ordinances of God, shall likewise be rewarded with paradise: Wherefore bear good tidings unto the faithful
It is not allowed unto the prophet, nor those who are true believers, that they pray for idolaters, although they be of kin, after it is become known unto them, that they are inhabitants of hell
Neither did Abraham ask forgiveness for his father, otherwise than in pursuance of a promise which he had promised unto him: But when it became known unto him, that he was an enemy unto God, he declared himself clear of him. Verily Abraham was putiful and compassionate
Nor is God disposed to lead people into error, after that He hath directed them, until that which they ought to avoid is become known unto them; for God knoweth all things
Verily unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and of earth; He giveth life, and He causeth to die; and ye have no patron or helper besides God
God is reconciled unto the prophet, and unto the Mohajerin, and the Ansars, who followed Him in the hour of distress, after that it had wanted little but that the hearts of a part of them had swerved from their duty: Afterwards was He turned unto them; for He was compassionate and merciful towards them
And He is also reconciled unto the three who were left behind, so that the earth became too strait for them, notwithstanding its spaciousness, and their souls became straitened within them, and they considered that there was no refuge from God, otherwise than by having recourse unto Him. Then was He turned unto them, that they might repent; for God is easy to be reconciled and merciful
O true believers, fear God, and be with the sincere
There was no reason why the inhabitants of Medina, and the Arabs of the desert who dwell around them, should stay behind the apostle of God, or should prefer themselves before him. This is unreasonable: Because they are not distressed either by thirst, or labour, or hunger, for the defence of God's true religion; neither do they stir a step, which may irritate the unbelievers; neither do they receive from the enemy any damage, but a good work is written down unto them for the same; for God suffereth not the reward of the righteous to perish
And they contribute not any sum either small or great, nor do they pass a valley, but it is written down unto them, that God may reward them with a recompense exceeding that which they have wrought
The believers are not obliged to go forth to war all together; If a part of every band of them go not forth, it is that they may diligently instruct themselves in their religion; and may admonish their people, when they return unto them, that they may take heed to themselves
O true believers, wage war against such of the infidels as are near you; and let them find severity in you: And know that God is with those who fear him
Whenever a sura is sent down, there are some of them who say, which of you hath this caused to increase in faith? It will increase the faith of those who believe, and they shall rejoice
But unto those in whose hearts there is an infirmity, it will add farther doubt unto their present doubt; and they shall die in their infidelity
Do they not see that they are tried every year once or twice? Yet they repent not, neither are they warned
And whenever a sura is sent down, they look at one another, saying, doth any one see you? Then do they turn aside. God shall turn aside their hearts from the truth; because they are a people who do not understand
Now hath an apostle come unto you of our own nation, an excellent person: It is grievous unto him that ye commit wickedness; He is careful over you, and compassionate and merciful towards the believers
If they turn back, say, God is my support: There is no God but He. On Him do I trust; and He is the Lord of the magnificent throne
These are the signs of the wise book
Is it a strange thing unto the men of Mecca, that We have revealed our will unto a man from among them, saying, denounce threats unto men if they believe not; and bear good tidings unto those who believe, that on the merit of their sincerity they have an interest with their Lord? The unbelievers say, this is manifest sorcery
Verily your Lord is God, who hath created the heavens and the earth in six days; and then ascended his throne, to take on himself the government of all things. There is no intercessor, but by his permission. This is God, your Lord; therefore serve him. Will ye not consider
Unto Him shall ye all return, according to the certain promise of God: For He produceth a creature, and then causeth it to return again; that He may reward those who believe and do that which is right, with equity. But as for the unbelievers, they shall drink boiling water, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment, for that they have disbelieved
It is He who hath ordained the sun to shine by day, and the moon for a light by night; and hath appointed her stations, that ye might know the number of years, and the computation of time. God hath not created this, but with truth. He explaineth his signs unto people who understand
Moreover in the vicissitude of night and day, and whatever God hath created in heaven and earth, are surely signs unto men who fear Him
Verily they who hope not to meet Us at the last day, and delight in this present life, and rest securely in the same, and who are negligent of our signs
their dwelling shall be hell fire, for that which they have deserved
But as to those who believe, and work righteousness, their Lord will direct them because of their faith; they shall have rivers flowing through gardens of pleasure
Their prayer therein shall be, praise be unto thee, O God! And their salutation therein shall be, peace! And the end of their prayer shall be, praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
If God should cause evil to hasten unto men, according to their desire of hastening good, verily their end had been decreed. Wherefore We suffer those who hope not to meet Us at the resurrection, to wander amazedly in their error
When evil befalleth a man; he prayeth unto Us lying on his side, or sitting, or standing: But when We deliver him from his affliction, he continueth his former course of life, as though he had not called upon Us to defend him against the evil which had befallen him. Thus was that which the transgressors committed prepared for them
We have formerly destroyed the generations who were before you, O men of Mecca, when they had acted unjustly, and our apostles had come unto them with evident miracles and they would not believe. Thus do We reward the wicked people
Afterwards did We cause you to succeed them in the earth; that We might see how ye would act
When our evident signs are recited unto them, they who hope not to meet us at the resurrection, say, bring a different Koran from this; or make some change therein. Answer, it is not fit for me, that I should change it at my pleasure: I follow that only which is revealed unto me. Verily I fear, if I should be disobedient unto my Lord, the punishment of the great day
Say, if God had so pleased, I had not read it unto you, neither had I taught you the same. I have already dwelt among you to the age of forty years, before I received it. Do ye not therefore understand
And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie against God, or accuseth his signs of falsehood? Surely the wicked shall not prosper
They worship besides God, that which can neither hurt them nor profit them, and they say, these are our intercessors with God. Answer, will ye tell God that which He knoweth not, neither in heaven nor in earth? Praise be unto Him! And far be that from Him, which they associate with Him
Men were professors of one religion only, but they dissented therefrom; and if a decree had not previously issued from thy Lord, deferring their punishment, verily the matter had been decided between them, concerning which they disagreed
They say, unless a sign be sent down unto him from his Lord, we will not believe. Answer, verily that which is hidden is known only unto God: Wait therefore the pleasure of God; and I also will wait with you
And when We caused the men of Mecca to taste mercy, after an affliction which had befallen them, behold, they devised a stratagem against our signs. Say unto them, God is more swift in executing a stratagem, than ye. Verily our messengers write down that which ye deceitfully devise
It is He who hath given you conveniencies for travelling by land and by sea; so that ye be in ships, which sail with them, with a favourable wind, and they rejoice therein. And when a tempestuous wind overtaketh them, and waves come upon them from every side, and they think themselves to be encompassed with inevitable dangers; they call upon God, exhibiting the pure religion unto Him, and saying, verily if Thou deliver us from this peril, we will be of those who give thanks
But when He had delivered them, behold, they behaved themselves insolently in the earth, without justice. O men, verily the violence which ye commit against your own souls, is for the enjoyment of this present life only; afterwards unto Us shall ye return, and We will declare unto you that which ye have done
Verily the likeness of this present life is no other than as water, which We send down from heaven, and wherewith the productions of the earth are mixed, of which men eat, and cattle also, until the earth receive its vesture, and be adorned with various plants: The inhabitants thereof imagine that they have power over the same; but our command cometh unto it by night, or by day, and we render it as though it had been mown, as though it had not yesterday abounded with fruits. Thus do We explain our signs unto people who consider
God inviteth unto the dwelling of peace, and directeth whom He pleaseth into the right way
They who do right shall receive a most excellent reward, and a superabundant addition; neither blackness nor shame shall cover their faces. These shall be the inhabitants of paradise; they shall continue therein for ever
But they who commit evil shall receive the reward of evil, equal thereunto, and they shall be covered with shame, -- for they shall have no protector against God; -- as though their faces were covered with the profound darkness of the night. These shall be the inhabitants of hell fire; they shall remain therein for ever
On the day of the resurrection We will gather them altogether; then will We say unto the idolaters, get ye to your place, ye and your companions: And We will separate them from one another; and their companions shall say unto them, ye did not worship us
and God is a sufficient witness between us and you; neither did we mind your worshipping of us
There shall every soul experince that which it shall have sent before it; and they shall be brought before God, their true Lord; and the false deities which they vainly imagined, shall disappear from before them
Say, who provideth you food from heaven and earth? Or who hath the absolute power over the hearing and the sight? And who bringeth forth the living from the dead, and bringeth forth the dead from the living? And who governeth all things? They will surely answer, God. Say, will ye not therefore fear Him
This is therefore God, your true Lord: And what remaineth there after truth, except error? How therefore are ye turned aside from the truth
Thus is the word of thy Lord verified upon them who do wickedly, that they believe not
Say, is there any of your companions who produceth a creature, and then causeth it to return unto Himself? Say, God produceth a creature, and then causeth it to return unto Himself. How therefore are ye turned aside from his worship
Say, is there any of your companions who directeth unto the truth? Say, God directeth unto the truth. Whether is he therefore, who directeth unto the truth, more worthy to be followed; or he who directeth not, unless he be directed? What aileth you therefore, that ye judge as ye do
And the greater part of them follow an uncertain opinion only; but a mere opinion attaineth not unto any truth. Verily God knoweth that which they do
This Koran could not have been composed by any except God; but it is a confirmation of that which was revealed before it, and an explanation of the scripture; there is no doubt thereof; sent down from the Lord of all creatures
Will they say, Mohammed hath forged it? Answer, bring therefore a chapter like unto it; and call whom ye may to your assistance, besides God, if ye speak truth
But they have charged that with falsehood, the knowledge whereof they do not comprehend, neither hath the interpretation thereof come unto them. In the same manner did those who were before them, accuse their prophets of imposture; but behold, what was the end of the unjust
There are some of them who believe therein; and there are some of them who believe not therein: And thy Lord well knoweth the corrupt doers
If they accuse thee of imposture, say, I have my work, and ye have your work; ye shall be clear of that which I do, and I will be clear of that which ye do
There are some of them who hearken unto thee; but wilt thou make the deaf to hear, although they do not understand
And there are some of them who look at thee; but wilt thou direct the blind, although they see not
Verily God will not deal unjustly with men in any respect: But men deal unjustly with their own souls
On a certain day He will gather them together, as though they had not tarried above an hour of a day: They shall know one another. Then shall they perish who have denied the meeting of God; and were not rightly directed
Whether We cause thee to see a part of the punishment wherewith We have threatened them, or whether We cause thee to die before thou see it; unto Us shall they return: Then shall God be witness of that which they do
Unto every nation hath an apostle been sent: And when their apostle came, the matter was decided between them with equity; and they were not treated unjustly
The unbelievers say, when will this threatening be made good, if ye speak truth
Answer, I am able neither to procure advantage unto my self, nor to avert mischief from me, but as God pleaseth. Unto every nation is a fixed term decreed; when their term therefore is expired, they shall not have respite for an hour, neither shall their punishment be anticipated
Say, tell me; if the punishment of God overtake you by night, or by day, what part thereof will the ungodly wish to be hastened
When it falleth on you, do ye then believe it? Now do ye believe, and wish it far from you, when ye formerly desired it should be hastened
Then shall it be said unto the wicked, taste ye the punishment of eternity: Would ye receive other than the reward of that which ye have wrought
They will desire to know of thee, whether this be true. Answer, yea, by my Lord, it is certainly true; neither shall ye weaken God's power, so as to escape it
Verily, if every soul which hath acted wickedly had whatever is on the earth, it would willingly redeem it self therewith at the last day. Yet they will conceal their repentance, after they shall have seen the punishment: And the matter shall be decided between them with equity; and they shall not be unjustly treated
Doth not whatsoever is in heaven and on earth belong unto God? Is not the promise of God true? But the greater part of them know it not
He giveth life, and He causeth to die; and unto Him shall ye all return
O men, now hath an admonition come unto you from your Lord, and a remedy for the doubts which are in your breasts; and a direction, and mercy unto the true believers
Say, through the grace of God, and his mercy: Therein therefore let them rejoice; this will be better than what they heap together of worldly riches
Say, tell me; of that which God hath sent down unto you for food, have ye declared part to be lawful, and other part to be unlawful? Say, hath God permitted you to make this distinction? Or do ye devise a lie concerning God
But what will be the opinion of those who devise a lie concerning God, on the day of the resurrection? Verily God is indued with beneficence towards mankind; but the greater part of them do not give thanks
Thou shalt be engaged in no business, neither shalt thou be employed in meditating on any passage of the Koran; nor shall ye do any action, but We will be witnesses over you, when ye are employed therein. Nor is so much as the weight of an ant hidden from thy Lord, in earth or in heaven: Neither is there any thing lesser than that, or greater, but it is written in the perspicuous book
Are not the friends of God the persons, on whom no fear shall come, and who shall not be grieved
They who believe and fear God
shall receive good tidings in this life, and in that which is to come. There is no change in the words of God. This shall be great felicity
Let not their discourse grieve thee; for all might belongeth unto God: He both heareth and knoweth
Is not whoever dwelleth in heaven and on earth, subject unto God? What therefore do they follow, who invoke idols, besides God? They follow nothing but a vain opinion; and they only utter lies

They may enjoy a provision in this world; but afterwards unto Us shall they return, and We will then cause them to taste a grievous punishment, for that they were unbelievers
Rehearse unto them the history of Noah: When he said unto his people, O my people, if my standing forth among you, and my warning you of the signs of God, be grievous unto you; in God do I put my trust. Therefore lay your design against me, and assemble your false gods; but let not your design be carried on by you in the dark: Then come forth against me, and delay not
And if ye turn aside from my admonition, I ask not any reward of you for the same; I expect my reward from God alone, and I am commanded to be one of those who are resigned unto Him
But they accused him of imposture; wherefore We delivered him, and those who were with him in the ark, and We caused them to survive the flood, but We drowned those who charged our signs with falsehood. Behold therefore, what was the end of those who were warned by Noah
Then did We send, after him, apostles unto their respective people, and they came unto them with evident demonstrations: Yet they were not disposed to believe in that which they had before rejected as false. Thus do We seal up the hearts of the transgressors

And God will verify the truth of his words, although the wicked be averse thereto

but deliver us, through thy mercy, from the unbelieving people
And We spake by inspiration unto Moses and his brother, saying, provide habitations for your people in Egypt, and make your houses a place of worship, and be constant at prayer; and bear good news unto the true believers
And Moses said, O Lord, verily Thou hast given unto Pharaoh and his people pompous ornaments, and riches in this present life, O Lord, that they may be seduced from thy way: O Lord, bring their riches to nought, and harden their hearts; that they may not believe, until they see their grievous punishment
God said, your petition is heard: Be ye upright therefore, and follow not the way of those who are ignorant
And we caused the children of Israel to pass through the sea; and Pharaoh and his army followed them in a violent and hostile manner; until, when he was drowning, he said, I believe that there is no God but He, on whom the children of Israel believe; and I am one of the resigned
Now dost thou believe; when thou hast been hitherto rebellious, and one of the wicked doers
This day will We raise thy body from the bottom of the sea, that thou mayest be a sign unto those who shall be after thee; and verily a great number of men are negligent of our signs

although there come unto them every kind of miracle; until they see the grievous punishment prepared for them
And if it were not so, some city, among the many which have been destroyed, would have believed; and the faith of its inhabitants would have been of advantage unto them: But none of them believed, before the execution of their sentence, except the people of Jonas. When they believed, We delivered them from the punishment of shame in this world, and suffered them to enjoy their lives and possessions for a time

neither invoke, besides God, that which can neither profit thee nor hurt thee: For if thou do, thou wilt then certainly become one of the unjust

Unto God shall ye return; and He is almighty
Do they not double the folds of their breasts, that they may conceal their designs from him? When they cover themselves with their garments, doth not He know that which they conceal, and that which they discover? For He knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
There is no creature which creepeth on the earth, but God provideth its food; and He knoweth the place of its retreat, and where it is laid up. The whole is written in the perspicuous book of his decrees
It is He who hath created the heavens and the earth in six days, -- but his throne was above the waters before the creation thereof, -- that He might prove you, and see which of you would excel in works. If thou say, ye shall surely be raised again, after death; the unbelievers will say, this is nothing but manifest sorcery
And verily if We defer their punishment unto a determined season, they will say, what hindreth it from falling on us? Will it not come upon them on a day, wherein there shall be none to avert it from them; and that which they scoffed at shall encompass them

And if we cause him to taste favour, after an affliction hath befallen him, he will surely say, the evils which I suffered are passed from me; and he will become joyful and insolent
Except those who persevere with patience, and do that which is right; they shall receive pardon, and a great reward
Peradventure thou wilt omit to publish part of that which hath been revealed unto thee, and thy breast will become straitened, lest they say, unless a treasure be sent down unto him, or an angel come with him, to bear witness unto him, we will not believe. Verily thou art a preacher only; and God is the governor of all things
Will they say, he hath forged the Koran? Answer, bring therefore ten chapters like unto it, forged by your selves; and call on whomsoever ye may to assist you, except God, if ye speak truth

Whoso chooseth the present life, and the pomp thereof, unto them will We give the recompense of their works therein, and the same shall not be diminished unto them
These are they for whom no other reward is prepared in the next life, except the fire of hell: That which they have done in this life shall perish; and that which they have wrought shall be vain
Shall he therefore be compared with them, who followeth the evident declaration of his Lord, and whom a witness from him attendeth, preceded by the book of Moses, which was revealed for a guide, and out of mercy to mankind? These believe in the Koran: But whosoever of the confederate infidels believeth not therein, is threatened with the fire of hell, which threat shall certainly be executed: Be not therefore in a doubt concerning it; for it is the truth from thy Lord: But the greater part of men will not believe
Who is more unjust than he who imagineth a lie concerning God? They shall be set before their Lord, at the day of judgment, and the witnesses shall say, these are they who devised lies against their Lord. Shall not the curse of God fall on the unjust
who turn men aside from the way of God, and seek to render it crooked, and who believe not in the life to come
These were not able to prevail against God on earth, so as to escape punishment; neither had they any protectors besides God: Their punishment shall be doubled unto them. They could not hear, neither did they see
These are they who have lost their souls; and the idols which they falsely imagined, have abandoned them
There is no doubt but they shall be most miserable in the world to come
But as for those who believe, and do good works, and humble themselves before their Lord, they shall be the inhabitants of paradise; they shall remain therein for ever
The similitude of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf, and as he who seeth and heareth: Shall they be compared as equal? Will ye not therefore consider
We formerly sent Noah unto his people; and he said, verily I am a public preacher unto you
that ye worship God alone: Verily I fear for you the punishment of the terrible day
But the chiefs of his people, who believed not, answered, we see thee to be no other than a man, like unto us; and we do not see that any follow thee, except those who are the most abject among us, who have believed on thee by a rash judgment; neither do we perceive any excellence in you above us: But we esteem you to be liars
Noah said, O my people, tell me; if I have received an evident declaration from my Lord, and He hath bestowed on me mercy from Himself, which is hidden from you, do we compel you to receive the same, in case ye be averse thereto
O my people, I ask not of you any riches, for my preaching unto you: My reward is with God alone. I will not drive away those who have believed: Verily they shall meet their Lord, at the resurrection; but I perceive that ye are ignorant men
O my people, who shall assist me against God, if I drive them away? Will ye not therefore consider
I say not unto you, the treasures of God are in my power; neither do I say, I know the secrets of God: Neither do I say, verily I am an angel; neither do I say of those whom your eyes do condemn, God will by no means bestow good on them: -- God best knoweth that which is in their souls; -- for then should I certainly be one of the unjust
They answered, O Noah, thou hast already disputed with us, and hast multiplied disputes with us; now therefore do thou bring that punishment upon us wherewith thou hast threatened us, if thou speakest truth
Noah said, verily God alone shall bring it upon you, if He pleaseth; and ye shall not prevail against Him, so as to escape the same
Neither shall my counsel profit you, although I endeavour to counsel you aright, if God shall please to lead you into error. He is your Lord, and unto Him shall ye return
Will the Meccans say, Mohammed hath forged the Koran? Answer, if I have forged it, on me be my guilt; and let me be clear of that which ye are guilty of
And it was revealed unto Noah, saying, verily none of thy people shall believe, except he who hath already believed: Be not therefore grieved, for that which they are doing
But make an ark in our presence, according to the form and dimensions which We have revealed unto thee: And speak not unto Me in behalf of those who have acted unjustly; for they are doomed to be drowned
And he built the ark; and so often as a company of his people passed by him, they derided him: But he said, though ye scoff at us now, we will scoff at you hereafter, as ye scoff at us
and ye shall surely know on whom a punishment shall be inflicted, which shall cover him with shame, and on whom a lasting punishment shall fall
Thus were they employed until our sentence was put in execution, and the oven poured forth water. And We said unto Noah, carry into the ark of every species of animals one pair; and thy family, -- except him on whom a previous sentence of destruction hath passed, -- and those who believe. But there believed not with him, except a few
And Noah said, embark thereon, in the name of God; while it moveth forward, and while it standeth still; for my Lord is gracious and merciful
And the ark swam with them between waves like mountains: And Noah called unto his son, who was separated from him, saying, embark with us, my son, and stay not with the unbelievers
He answered, I will get on a mountain, which will secure me from the water. Noah replied, there is no security this day from the decree of God, except for him on whom He shall have mercy. And a wave passed between them, and he became one of those who were drowned
And it was said, O earth, swallow up thy waters, and thou, O heaven, withhold thy rain. And immediately the water abated, and the decree was fulfilled, and the ark rested on the mountain Al Judi; and it was said, away with the ungodly people
And Noah called upon his Lord, and said, O Lord, verily my son is of my family; and thy promise is true: For thou art the most just of those who exercise judgment
God answered, O Noah, verily he is not of thy family: This intercession of thine for him, is not a righteous work. Ask not of me therefore that wherein thou hast no knowledge: I admonish thee that thou become not one of the ignorant
Noah said, O Lord, I have recourse unto Thee for the assistance of thy grace, that I ask not of Thee that wherein I have no knowledge: And unless thou forgive me, and be merciful unto me, I shall be one of those who perish
It was said unto him, O Noah, come down from the ark, with peace from us, and blessings upon thee, and upon a part of those who are with thee: But as for a part of them, We will suffer them to enjoy the provision of this world; and afterwards shall a grievous punishment from us be inflicted on them, in the life to come
This is a secret history, which we reveal unto thee: Thou didst not know it, neither did thy people, before this. Wherefore persevere with patience; for the prosperous issue shall attend the pious
And unto the tribe of Ad we sent their brother Hud. He said, O my people worship God; ye have no God besides him: Ye only imagine falsehood, in setting up idols and intercessors of your own making
O my people, I ask not of you for this my preaching, any recompense: My recompense do I expect from Him only, Who hath created me. Will ye not therefore understand
O my people, ask pardon of your Lord; and be turned unto Him: He will send the heaven to pour forth rain plentifully upon you, and He will increase your strength by giving unto you farther strength: Therefore turn not aside, to commit evil
They answered, O Hud, thou hast brought us no proof of what thou sayest; therefore we will not leave our gods for thy saying, neither do we believe thee
We say no other than that some of our gods have afflicted thee with evil. He replied, verily I call God to witness, and do ye also bear witness, that I am clear of that which ye associate with God
besides Him. Do ye all therefore join to devise a plot against me, and tarry not
for I put my confidence in God, my Lord and your Lord. There is no beast, but he holdeth it by its forelock: Verily my Lord proceedeth in the right way
But if ye turn back, I have already declared unto you that with which I was sent unto you; and my Lord shall substitute another nation in your stead; and ye shall not hurt him at all: For my Lord is guardian over all things
And when our sentence came to be put in execution, We delivered Hud, and those who had believed with him, through our mercy; and We delivered them from a grievous punishment
And this tribe of Ad wittingly rejected the signs of their Lord, and were disobedient unto his messengers, and they followed the command of every rebellious perverse person
Wherefore they were followed in this world by a curse, and they shall be followed by the same on the day of resurrection. Did not Ad disbelieve in their Lord? Was it not said, away with Ad, the people of Hud
And unto the tribe of Thamud we sent their brother Saleh. He said unto them, O my people, worship God; ye have no God besides Him. It is He who hath produced you out of the earth, and hath given you an habitation therein. Ask pardon of Him therefore, and be turned unto Him; for my Lord is near, and ready to answer
They answered, oh, thou wast a person on whom we placed our hopes before this. Dost thou forbid us to worship that which our fathers worshipped? But we are certainly in doubt concerning the religion to which thou dost invite us, as justly to be suspected
Saleh said, O my people, tell me; if I have received an evident declaration from my Lord, and He hath bestowed on me mercy from Himself; who will protect me from the vengeance of God, if I be disobedient unto Him? For ye shall not add unto me, other than loss
And he said, O my people, this she-camel of God is a sign unto you; therefore dismiss her freely that she may feed in God's earth, and do her no harm, lest a swift punishment seize you
Yet they killed her; and Saleh said, enjoy yourselves in your dwellings for three days; after which ye shall be destroyed. This is an infallible prediction
And when our decree came to be executed, we delivered Saleh and those who believed with him, through our mercy, also from the disgrace of that day; for thy Lord is the strong, the mighty God
But a terrible noise from heaven assailed those who had acted unjustly; and in the morning they were found in their houses, lying dead and prostrate
as though they had never dwelt therein. Did not Thamud disbelieve in their Lord? Was not Thamud cast far away
Our messengers also came formerly unto Abraham, with good tidings: They said, peace be upon thee. And he answered, and on you be peace! And he tarried not, but brought a roasted calf
And when he saw that their hands did not touch the meat, he misliked them, and entertained a fear of them. But they said, fear not: For we are sent unto the people of Lot
And his wife Sarah was standing by, and she laughed; and We promised her Isaac, and after Isaac, Jacob
She said, alas! Shall I bear a son, who am old; this my husband also being advanced in years? Verily this would be a wonderful thing
The angels answered, dost thou wonder at the effect of the command of God? The mercy of God and his blessings be upon you, the family of the house: For He is praiseworthy, and to be glorified
And when his apprehension had departed from Abraham, and the good tidings of Isaac's birth had come unto him, he disputed with us concerning the people of Lot
For Abraham was a pitiful, compassionate, and devout person
The angels said unto him, O Abraham, abstain from this; for now is the command of thy Lord come, to put their sentence in execution, and an inevitable punishment is ready to fall upon them
And when our messengers came unto Lot, he was troubled for them, and his arm was straitened concerning them, and he said, this is a grievous day
And his people came unto him, rushing upon him: And they had formerly been guilty of wickedness. Lot said unto them, O my people, these my daughters are more lawful for you: Therefore fear God, and put me not to shame by wronging my guests. Is there not a man of prudence among you
They answered, thou knowest that we have no need of thy daughters; and thou well knowest what we would have
He said, if I had strength sufficient to oppose you, or I could have recourse unto a powerful support; I would certainly do it
The angels said, O Lot, verily we are the messengers of thy Lord; they shall by no means come in unto thee. Go forth therefore with thy family, in some part of the night, and let not any of you turn back: But as for thy wife, that shall happen unto her, which shall happen unto them. Verily the prediction of their punishment shall be fulfilled in the morning: Is not the morning near
And when our command came, We turned those cities upside down, and We rained upon them stones of baked clay, one following another
and being marked, from thy Lord; and they are not far distant from those who act unjustly
And unto Madian We sent their brother Shoaib: He said, O my people, worship God; ye have no God but Him: And diminish not measure and weight. Verily I see you to be in a happy condition: But I fear for you the punishment of the day which will encompass the ungodly
O my people, give full measure, and just weight; and diminish not unto men ought of their matters; neither commit injustice in the earth, acting corruptly
The residue which shall remain unto you as the gift of God, after ye shall have done justice to others, will be better for you, than wealth gotten by fraud; if ye be true believers. I am no guardian over you
They answered, O Shoaib, do thy prayers enjoin thee, that we should leave the gods which our fathers worshipped; or that we should not do what we please with our substance? Thou only, it seems, art the wise person, and fit to direct
He said, O my people, tell me; if I have received an evident declaration from my Lord, and He hath bestowed on me an excellent provision, and I will not consent unto you in that which I forbid you; do I seek any other than your reformation, to the utmost of my power? My support is from God alone; on Him do I trust, and unto Him do I turn me
O my people, let not your opposing of me, draw on you a vengeance like unto that which fell on the people of Noah, or the people of Hud, or the people of Saleh: Neither was the people of Lot far distant from you
Ask pardon therefore of your Lord; and be turned unto him: For my Lord is merciful, and loving
They answered, O Shoaib, we understand not much of what thou sayest; and we see thee to be a man of no power among us: If it had not been for the sake of thy family, we had surely stoned thee, neither couldest thou have prevailed against us
Shoaib said, O my people, is my family more worthy in your opinion, than God? And do ye cast him behind you with neglect? Verily my Lord comprehendeth that which ye do
O my people, do ye work according to your condition; I will surely work according to my duty. And ye shall certainly know, on whom will be inflicted a punishment which shall cover him with shame, and who is a liar. Wait therefore the event; for I also will wait it with you
Wherefore when our decree came to be executed, we delivered Shoaib and those who believed with him, through our mercy: And a terrible noise from heaven assailed those who had acted unjustly; and in the morning they were found in their houses lying dead and prostrate
as though they had never dwelt therein. Was not Madian removed from off the earth, as Thamud had been removed
And we formerly sent Moses with our signs, and manifest power
unto Pharaoh and his princes: But they followed the command of Pharaoh; although the command of Pharaoh did not direct them aright
Pharaoh shall precede his people on the day of resurrection, and he shall lead them into hell fire; an unhappy way shall it be which they shall be led
They were followed in this life by a curse, and on the day of resurrection miserable shall be the gift which shall be given them
This is a part of the histories of the cities, which We rehearse unto thee. Of them there are some standing; and others which are utterly demolished
And We treated them not unjustly, but they dealt unjustly with their own souls: And their gods which they invoked, besides God, were of no advantage unto them at all, when the decree of thy Lord came to be executed on them, neither were they any other than a detriment unto them
And thus was the punishment of thy Lord inflicted, when He punished the cities which were unjust; for his punishment is grievous and severe
Verily herein is a sign unto him who feareth the punishment of the last day: That shall be a day, whereon all men shall be assembled, and that shall be a day whereon witness shall be born
We defer it not, but to a determined time
When that day shall come, no soul shall speak to excuse it self, or to intercede for another, but by the permission of God. Of them one shall be miserable, and another shall be happy
And they who shall be miserable, shall be thrown into hell fire; there shall they wail and bemoan themselves
They shall remain therein so long as the heavens and the earth shall endure; except what thy Lord shall please to remit of their sentence; for thy Lord effecteth that which He pleaseth
But they who shall be happy, shall be admitted into paradise; they shall remain therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure; besides what thy Lord shall please to add unto their bliss; a bounty which shall not be interrupted
Be not therefore in doubt concerning that which these men worship: They worship not other than what their fathers worshipped before them; and We will surely give them their full portion, not in the least diminished
We formerly gave unto Moses the book of the law; and disputes arose among his people concerning it: And unless a previous decree had proceeded from thy Lord, to bear with them during this life, the matter had been surely decided between them. And thy people are also jealous and in doubt concerning the Koran
But unto every one of them will thy Lord render the reward of their works; for He well knoweth that which they do
Be thou stedfast therefore, as thou hast been commanded; and let him also be stedfast who shall be converted with thee; and transgress not: For He seeth that which ye do
And incline not unto those who act unjustly, lest the fire of hell touch you: For ye have no protectors, except God; neither shall ye be assisted against Him
Pray regularly morning and evening; and in the former part of the night, for good works drive away evils. This is an admonition unto those who consider
Wherefore persevere with patience ; for God suffereth not the reward of the righteous to perish
Were such of the generations before you, indued with understanding and virtue, who forbad the acting corruptly in the earth, any more than a few only of those whom We delivered? But they who were unjust followed the delights which they enjoyed in this world, and were wicked doers
And thy Lord was not of such a disposition as to destroy the cities unjustly, while their inhabitants behaved themselves uprightly
And if thy Lord pleased, He would have made all men of one religion: But they shall not cease to differ among themselves
unless those on whom thy Lord shall have mercy: And unto this hath He created them; for the word of thy Lord shall be fulfilled, when He said, verily I will fill hell altogether with genii and men
The whole which we have related of the histories of our apostles do we relate unto thee, that we may confirm thy heart thereby; and herein is the truth come unto thee, and an admonition, and a warning unto the true believers
Say unto those who believe not, act ye according to your condition; we surely will act according to our duty
And wait the issue; for we certainly wait it also
Unto God is known that which is secret in heaven and earth; and unto Him shall the whole matter be referred. Therefore worship Him, and put thy trust in Him; for thy Lord is not regardless of that which ye do
These are the signs of the perspicuous book
which We have sent down in the Arabic tongue, that peradventure ye might understand
We relate unto thee a most excellent history, by revealing unto thee this Koran, whereas thou wast before one of the negligent
When Joseph said unto his father, O my father, verily I saw in my dream eleven stars, and the sun and the moon; I saw them make obeisance unto me
Jacob said, O my child, tell not thy vision to thy brethren, lest they devise some plot against thee; for the devil is a professed enemy unto man
And thus, according to thy dream, shall thy Lord choose thee, and teach thee the interpretation of dark sayings, and He shall accomplish his favour upon thee and upon the family of Jacob, as He hath formerly accomplished it upon thy fathers Abraham and Isaac; for thy Lord is knowing and wise
Surely in the history of Joseph and his brethren there are signs of God's providence to the inquisitive
when they said to one another, Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we, who are the greater number: Our father certainly maketh a wrong judgment
Wherefore slay Joseph, or drive him into some distant or desert part of the earth, and the face of your father shall be cleared towards you; and ye shall afterwards be people of integrity
One of them spoke and said; slay not Joseph, but throw him to the bottom of the well; and some travellers will take him up, if ye do this
They said unto Jacob, O father, why dost thou not intrust Joseph with us, since we are sincere well-wishers unto him
Send him with us to morrow, into the field, that he may divert himself, and sport, and we will be his guardians
Jacob answered, it grieveth me that ye take him away; and I fear lest the wolf devour him, while ye are negligent of him
They said, surely if the wolf devour him, when there are so many of us, we shall be weak indeed
And when they had carried him with them, and agreed to set him at the bottom of the well, they executed their design: And We sent a revelation unto him, saying, thou shalt hereafter declare this their action unto them; and they shall not perceive thee to be Joseph
And they came to their father at even, weeping
and said, father, we went and ran races with one another, and we left Joseph with our baggage, and the wolf hath devoured him; but thou wilt not believe us, although we speak the truth
And they produced his inner garment stained with false blood. Jacob answered, nay, but ye your selves have contrived the thing for your own sakes: However patience is most becoming, and God's assistance is to be implored to enable me to support the misfortune which ye relate
And certain travellers came, and sent one to draw water for them: And he let down his bucket, and said, good news! This is a youth. And they concealed him, that they might sell him as a piece of merchandize: but God knew that which they did
And they sold him for a mean price, for a few pence, and valued him lightly
And the Egyptian who bought him said to his wife, use him honourably; peradventure he may be serviceable to us, or we may adopt him for our son. Thus did we prepare an establishment for Joseph in the earth, and we taught him the interpretation of dark sayings: For God is well able to effect his purpose; but the greater part of men do not understand
And when he had attained his age of strength, we bestowed on him wisdom, and knowledge; for thus do we recompense the righteous
And she, in whose house he was, desired him to lie with her; and she shut the doors and said, come hither. He answered, God forbid! Verily my lord hath made my dwelling with Him easy; and the ungrateful shall not prosper
But she resolved within her self to enjoy him, and he would have resolved to enjoy her, had he not seen the evident demonstration of his Lord. So We turned away evil and filthiness from him, because he was one of our sincere servants
And they ran to get one before the other to the door; and she rent his inner garment behind. And they met her lord at the door. She said, what shall be the reward of him who seeketh to commit evil in thy family, but imprisonment, and a painful punishment
And Joseph said, she asked me to lie with her. And a witness of her family bore witness, saying, if his garment be rent before, she speaketh truth, and he is a liar
But if his garment be rent behind, she lieth, and he is a speaker of truth
And when her husband saw that his garment was torn behind, he said, this is a cunning contrivance of your sex; for surely your cunning is great
O Joseph, take no farther notice of this affair: And thou, O woman, ask pardon for thy crime; for thou art a guilty person
And certain women said publicly in the city, the nobleman's wife asked her servant to lie with her: He hath inflamed her breast with his love; and we perceive her to be in a manifest error
And when she heard of their subtle behaviour, she sent unto them, and prepared a banquet for them, and she gave to each of them a knife; and she said unto Joseph, come forth unto them. And when they saw him, they praised him greatly; and they cut their own hands, and said, O God! This is not a mortal; he is not other than an angel, deserving the highest respect
And his mistress said, this is he, for whose sake ye blamed me: I asked him to lie with me, but he hath constantly refused. But if he do not perform that which I command him, he shall surely be cast into prison, and he shall be made one of the contemptible
Joseph said, O Lord, a prison is more eligible unto me than the crime to which they invite me; but unless thou turn aside their snares from me, I shall youthfully incline unto them, and I shall become one of the foolish
Wherefore his Lord heard him, and turned aside their snare from him, for He both heareth and knoweth
And it seemed good unto them even after they had seen the signs of his innocency, to imprison him for a time
And there entered into the prison with him two of the king's servants. One of them said, it seemed to me in my dream that I pressed wine out of grapes. And the other said, it seemed unto me in my dream that I carried bread on my head, whereof the birds did eat. Declare unto us the interpretation of our dreams, for we perceive that thou art a beneficent person
Joseph answered, no food, wherewith ye may be nourished, shall come unto you, but I will declare unto you the interpretation thereof, before it come unto you. This knowledge is a part of that which my Lord hath taught me: For I have left the religion of people who believe not in God, and who deny the life to come
and I follow the religion of my fathers, Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob. It is not lawful for us to associate any thing with God. This knowledge of the divine unity hath been given us of the bounty of God towards us, and towards mankind; but the greater part of men are not thankful
O my fellow-prisoners, are sundry lords better, or the only true and mighty God
Ye worship not, besides Him, other than the names which ye have named, ye and your fathers, concerning which God hath sent down no authoritative proof: Yet judgment belongeth unto God alone; who hath commanded that ye worship none besides Him. This is the right religion; but the greater part of men know it not
O my fellow-prisoners, verily the one of you shall serve wine unto his lord, as formerly; but the other shall be crucified, and the birds shall eat from off his head. The matter is decreed concerning which ye seek to be informed
And Joseph said unto him whom he judged to be the person who should escape of the two, remember me in the presence of thy lord. But the devil caused him to forget to make mention of Joseph unto his lord; wherefore he remained in the prison some years
And the king of Egypt said, verily I saw in my dream seven fat kine, which seven lean kine devoured, and seven green ears of corn, and other seven withered ears. O nobles, expound my vision unto me, if ye be able to interpret a vision
They answered, they are confused dreams; neither are we skilled in the interpretation of such kind of dreams
And Joseph's fellow-prisoner who had been delivered, said, (for he remembered Joseph after a certain space of time) I will declare unto you the interpretation thereof; wherefore let me go unto the person who will interpret it unto me
And he went to the prison, and said, O Joseph, thou man of veracity, teach us the interpretation of seven fat kine, which seven lean kine devourd, and of seven green ears of corn; and other seven withered ears, which the king saw in his dream; that I may return unto the men who have sent me, that peradventure they may understand the same
Joseph answered, ye shall sow seven years as usual: And the corn which ye shall reap, do ye leave in its ear, except a little whereof ye may eat
Then shall there come, after this, seven grievous years of famine, which shall consume what ye shall have laid up as a provision for the same, except a little which ye shall have kept
Then shall there come, after this, a year wherein men shall have plenty of rain, and wherein thay shall press wine and oil
And when the chief butler had reported this, the king said, bring him unto me. And when the messenger came unto Joseph, he said, return unto thy lord, and ask of him, what was the intent of the women who cut their hands; for my Lord well knoweth the snare which they laid for me
And when the women were assembled before the king, he said unto them, what was your design, when ye solicited Joseph to unlawful love? They answered, God be praise! We know not any ill of him. The nobleman's wife said, now is the truth become manifest: I solicited him, to lie with me; and he is one of those who speak truth
And when Joseph was acquainted therewith he said, this discovery hath been made, that my lord might know that I was not unfaithful unto him in his absence, and that God directeth not the plot of the deceivers
Neither do I absolutely justify my self: Since every soul is prone unto evil, except those on whom my Lord shall shew mercy; for my Lord is gracious and merciful
And the king said, bring him unto me: I will take him into my own peculiar service. And when Joseph was brought unto the king, and he had discoursed with him, he said, thou art this day firmly established with us, and shalt be intrusted with our affairs
Joseph answered, set me over the store-houses of the land; for I will be a skilful keeper thereof
Thus did We establish Joseph in the land, that he might provide himself a dwelling therein, where he pleased. We bestow our mercy on whom We please, and We suffer not the reward of the righteous to perish
And certainly the reward of the next life is better, for those who believe, and fear God
Moreover Joseph's brethren came, and went in unto him; and he knew them, but they knew not him
And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he said, bring unto me your brother, the son of your father: Do ye not see that I give full measure, and that I am the most hospitable receiver of guests
But if ye bring him not unto me, there shall be no corn measured unto you from me, neither shall ye approach my presence
They answered, we will endeavour to obtain him of his father, and we will certainly perform what thou requirest
And Joseph said to his servants, put their money which they have paid for their corn, into their sacks, that they may perceive it, when they shall be returned to their family: Peradventure they will come back unto us
And when they were returned unto their father, they said, O father, it is forbidden to measure out corn unto us any more, unless we carry our brother Benjamin with us: Wherefore send our brother with us, and we shall have corn measured unto us; and we will certainly guard him from any mischance
Jacob answered, shall I trust him with you with any better success than I trusted your brother Joseph with you heretofore? But God is the best guardian; and He is the most merciful of those who shew mercy
And when they opened their provisions, they found their money had been returned unto them; and they said, O father, what do we desire farther? This our money hath been returned unto us: We will therefore return, and provide corn for our family: We will take care of our brother; and we shall receive a camel's burden more than we did the last time. This is a small quantity
Jacob said, I will by no means send him with you, until ye give me a solemn promise, and swear by God that ye will certainly bring him back unto me, unless ye be encompassed by some inevitable impediment. And when they had given him their solemn promise, he said, God is witness of what we say
And he said, my sons, enter not into the city by one and the same gate; but enter by different gates. But this precaution will be of no advantage unto you against the decree of God; for judgment belongeth unto God alone: In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let those confide who seek in whom to put their trust
And when they entered the city, as their father had commanded them, it was of no advantage unto them against the decree of God; and the same served only to satisfy the desire of Jacob's soul, which he had charged them to perform: For he was indued with knowledge of that which We had taught him; but the greater part of men do not understand
And when they entered into the presence of Joseph, he received his brother Benjamin as his guest, and said, verily I am thy brother: Be not therefore afflicted for that which they have committed against us
And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he put his cup in his brother Benjamin's sack. Then a cryer cried after them saying, O company of travellers, ye are surely thieves
They said, -- and turned back unto them, -- what is it that ye miss
They answered, we miss the prince's cup: And unto him who shall produce it, shall be given a camel's load of corn; and I will be surety for the same
Joseph's brethren replied, by God, ye do well know, that we come not to act corruptly in the land, neither are we thieves
The Egyptians said, what shall be the reward of him, who shall appear to have stolen the cup, if ye be found liars
Joseph's brethren answered, as to the reward of him, in whose sack it shall be found, let him become a bondman in satisfaction for the same: Thus do we reward the unjust, who are guilty of theft
Then he began by their sacks, before he searched the sack of his brother; and he drew out the cup from his brother's sack. Thus did we furnish Joseph with a stratagem. It was not lawful for him to take his brother for a bondman, by the law of the king of Egypt, had not God pleased to allow it, according to the offer of his brethren. We exalt to degrees of knowledge and honour whom we please: And there is one who is knowing above all those who are indued with knowledge
His brethren said, if Benjamin be guilty of theft, his brother Joseph hath been also guilty of theft heretofore. But Joseph concealed these things in his mind, and did not discover them unto them: And he said within himself, ye are in a worse condition than us two; and God best knoweth what ye discourse about
They said unto Joseph, noble lord, verily this lad hath an aged father; wherefore take one of us in his stead; for we perceive that thou art a beneficent person
Joseph answered, God forbid that we should take any other than him with whom we found our goods; for then should we certainly be unjust
And when they despaired of obtaining Benjamin, they retired to confer privately together. And the elder of them said, do ye not know that your father hath received a solemn promise from you, in the name of God; and how perfidiously ye behaved heretofore towards Joseph? Wherefore I will by no means depart the land of Egypt, until my father give me leave to return unto him, or God maketh known his will to me; for he is the best judge
Return ye to your father, and say, O father, verily thy son hath committed theft; we bear witness of no more than what we know, and we could not guard against what we did not foresee
And do thou inquire in the city, where we have been, and of the company of merchants, with whom we are arrived, and thou wilt find that we speak the truth
And when they were returned, and had spoken thus to their father, he said, nay but rather ye your selves have contrived the thing for your own sakes: But patience is most proper for me; peradventure God will restore them all unto me; for he is knowing and wise
And he turned from them and said, oh how am I grieved for Joseph! And his eyes became white with mourning, he being oppressed with deep sorrow
His sons said, by God, thou wilt not cease to remember Joseph, until thou be brought to death's door, or thou be actually destroyed by excessive affliction
He answered, I only represent my grief, which I am not able to contain, and my sorrow unto God; but I know by revelation from God that which ye know not
O my sons, go and make inquiry after Joseph and his brother; and despair not of the mercy of God; for none despaireth of God's mercy, except the unbelieving people
Wherefore Joseph's brethren returned into Egypt: And when they came into his presence they said, noble lord, the famine is felt by us and our family, and we are come with a small sum of money: Yet give unto us full measure, and bestow corn upon us as alms; for God rewardeth the alms-givers
Joseph said unto them, do ye know what ye did unto Joseph and his brother, when ye were ignorant of the consequences thereof
They answered, art thou really Joseph? He replied, I am Joseph; and this is my brother. Now hath God been gracious unto us. For whoso feareth God, and persevereth with patience, shall at length find relief; since God will not suffer the reward of the righteous to perish
They said, by God, now hath God chosen thee above us; and we have surely been sinners
Joseph answered, let there be no reproach cast on you this day. God forgiveth you; for he is the most merciful of those who shew mercy
Depart ye with this my inner garment, and throw it on my fathers's face; and he shall recover his sight: And then come unto me with all your family
And when the company of travellers was departed from Egypt on their journey towards Canaan, their father said unto those who were about him, verily I perceive the smell of Joseph: Although ye think that I dote
They answered, by God, thou art in thy old mistake
But when the messenger of good tidings was come with Joseph's inner garment, he threw it over his face; and he recovered his eye-sight. And Jacob said, did I not tell you that I knew from God, that which ye knew not
They answered, O father, ask pardon of our sins for us, for we have surely been sinners
He replied, I will surely ask pardon for you of my Lord; for He is gracious and merciful
And when Jacob and his family arrived in Egypt, and were introduced unto Joseph, he received his parents unto him, and said, enter ye into Egypt, by God's favour, in full security
And he raised his parents to the seat of state, and they, together with his brethren, fell down and did obeisance unto him. And he said, O my father, this is the interpretation of my vision, which I saw heretofore: Now hath my Lord rendered it true. And He hath surely been gracious unto me, since He took me forth from the prison, and hath brought you hither from the desert; after that the devil had sown discord between me and my brethren: For my Lord is gracious unto whom He pleaseth; and He is the knowing, the wise God
O Lord, Thou hast given me a part of the kingdom, and hast taught me the interpretation of dark sayings. The Creator of heaven and earth! Thou art my protector in this world, and in that which is to come: Make me to die a Moslem, and join me with the righteous
This is a secret history, which We reveal unto thee, O Mohammed, although thou wast not present with the brethren of Joseph, when they concerted their design, and contrived a plot against him
But the greater part of men, although thou earnestly desire it, will not believe
Thou shalt not demand of them any reward for thy publishing the Koran; it is no other than an admonition unto all creatures
And how many signs soever there be of the being, unity, and providence of God, in the heavens and the earth; they will pass by them, and will retire afar off from them
And the greater part of them believe not in God, without being also guilty of idolatry
Do they not believe that some overwhelming affliction shall fall on them, as a punishment from God; or that the hour of judgment shall overtake them suddenly, while they consider not its approach
Say unto those of Mecca, this is my way: I invite you unto God, by an evident demonstration; both I and he who followeth me; and, praise be unto God! I am not an idolater
We sent not any apostles before thee, except men, unto whom We revealed our will, and whom We chose out of those who dwelt in cities. Will they not go through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who have preceded them. But the dwelling of the next life shall surely be better for those who fear God. Will they not therefore understand
Their predecessors were born with for a time, until, when our apostles despaired of their conversion, and they thought that they were liars, our help came unto them, and We delivered whom We pleased; but our vengeance was not turned away from the wicked people
Verily in the histories of the prophets and their people there is an instructive example unto those who are indued with understanding. The Koran is not a new invented fiction; but a confirmation of those scriptures which have been revealed before it, and a distinct explication of every thing necessary, in respect either to faith or practice, and a direction and mercy unto people who believe
These are the signs of the book of the Koran: And that which hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord, is the truth; but the greater part of men will not believe
It is God who hath raised the heavens without visible pillars; and then ascended his throne, and compelled the sun and the moon to perform their services: Every of the heavenly bodies runneth an appointed course. He ordereth all things. He sheweth his signs distinctly, that ye may be assured ye must meet your Lord at the last day
It is He who hath stretched forth the earth, and placed therein stedfast mountains, and rivers; and hath ordained therein of every fruit two different kinds. He causeth the night to cover the day. Herein are certain signs unto people who consider
And in the earth are tracts of land of different natures, though bordering on each other; and also vineyards, and seeds, and palm-trees springing several from the same root, and singly from distinct roots. They are watered with the same water, yet We render some of them more excellent than others to eat. Herein are surely signs unto people who understand
If thou dost wonder at the infidels denying the resurrection, surely wonderful is their saying, after We shall have been reduced to dust, shall We be restored in a new creature? These are they who believe not in their Lord; these shall have collars on their necks, and these shall be the inhabitants of hell fire: Therein shall they abide for ever
They will ask of thee to hasten evil rather than good: Although there have already been examples of the divine vengeance before them. Thy Lord is surely indued with indulgence towards men, notwithstanding their iniquity; but thy Lord is also severe in punishing
The infidels say, unless a sign be sent down unto him from his Lord, we will not believe. Thou art commissioned to be a preacher only, and not a worker of miracles: And unto every people hath a director been appointed
God knoweth what every female beareth in her womb; and what the wombs want or exceed of their due time, or number of young. With him is every thing regulated according to a determined measure
He knoweth that which is hidden, and that which is revealed. He is the great, the most high
He among you who concealeth his words, and he who proclaimeth them in public; he also who seeketh to hide himself in the night, and he who goeth forth openly in the day, is equal in respect to the knowledge of God
Each of them hath angels mutually succeeding each other, before him, and behind him; they watch him by the command of God. Verily God will not change his grace which is in men, until they change the disposition in their souls by sin. When God willeth evil on a people, there shall be none to avert it; neither shall they have any protector beside Him
It is He who causeth the lightening to appear unto you, to strike fear, and to raise hope, and Who formeth the pregnant clouds
The thunder celebrateth his praise, and the angels also, for fear of Him. He sendeth his thunderbolts, and striketh therewith whom He pleaseth, while they dispute concerning God; for He is mighty in power
It is He who ought of right to be invoked; and the idols which they invoke besides Him, shall not hear them at all; otherwise than as he is heard, who stretcheth forth his hands to the water that it may ascend to his mouth, when it cannot ascend thither: The supplication of the unbelievers is utterly erroneous
Whatsoever is in heaven and on earth worshippeth God, voluntarily or of force; and their shadows also, morning and evening
Say, who is the Lord of heaven and earth? Answer, God. Say, have ye therefore taken unto yourselves protectors beside Him, who are unable either to help, or to defend themselves from hurt? Say, shall the blind and the seeing be esteemed equal? Or shall darkness and light be accounted the same? Or have they attributed companions unto God who have created as He hath created, so that their creation bear any resemblance unto His? Say, God the creator of all things; he is the one, the victorious God
He causeth water to descend from heaven, and the brooks flow according to their respective measure, and the floods bear the floating froth: And from the metals which they melt in the fire, seeking to cast ornaments or vessels for use, there ariseth a scum like unto it: Thus God setteth forth truth and vanity. But the scum is thrown off, and that which is useful to mankind remaineth on the earth. Thus doth God put forth parables
Unto those who obey their Lord, shall be given the most excellent reward: But those who obey Him not, although they were possessed of whatever is in the whole earth and as much more, they would give it all for their ransom. These will be brought to a terrible account: Their abode shall be hell; an unhappy couch shall it be
Shall he therefore, who knoweth that what hath been sent down unto thee from thy Lord, is truth, be rewarded as he who is blind? The prudent only will consider
who fulfil the covenant of God, and break not their contract
and who join that which God hath commanded to be joined, and who fear their Lord, and dread an ill account
and who persevere out of a sincere desire to please their Lord, and observe the stated times of prayer, and give alms out of what We have bestowed on them, in secret and openly, and who turn away evil with good: The reward of these shall be paradise
gardens of eternal abode, which they shall enter, and also whoever shall have acted uprightly, of their fathers, and their wives, and their posterity: And the angels shall go in unto them by every gate, saying
peace be upon you, because ye have endured with patience; how excellent a reward is paradise
But as for those who violate the covenant of God, after the establishment thereof, and who cut in sunder that which God hath commanded to be joined, and act corruptly in the earth, on them shall a curse fall, and they shall have a miserable dwelling in hell
God giveth provision in abundance unto whom He pleaseth, and is sparing unto whom He pleaseth. Those of Mecca rejoice in the present life; although the present life, in respect of the future, is but a precarious provision
The infidels say, unless a sign be sent down unto him from his Lord, we will not believe. Answer, verily God will lead into error whom He pleaseth, and will direct unto Himself him who repenteth
and those who believe, and whose hearts rest securely in the meditation of God; shall not mens hearts rest securely in the meditation of God
They who believe and do that which is right shall enjoy blessedness, and partake of a happy resurrection
Thus have We sent thee to a nation which other nations have preceded, unto whom prophets have likewise been sent, that thou mayest rehearse unto them that which We have revealed unto thee, even while they believe not in the merciful God. Say unto them, He is my Lord; there is no God but He: In him do I trust, and unto Him must I return
Though a Koran were revealed by which mountains should be removed, or the earth cleaved in sunder, or the dead be caused to speak, it would be in vain. But the matter belongeth wholly unto God. Do not therefore the believers know, that if God pleased, He would certainly direct all men? Adversity shall not cease to afflict the unbelievers for that which they have committed, or to sit down near their habitations, until God's promise come: For God is not contrary to the promise
Apostles before thee have been laughed to scorn; and I permitted the infidels to enjoy a long and happy life: But afterwards I punished them; and how severe was the punishment which I inflicted on them
Who is it therefore that standeth over every soul, to observe that which it committeth? They attribute companions unto God. Say, name them: Will ye declare unto Him that which He knoweth not in the earth? Or will ye name them in outward speech only? But the deceitful procedure of the infidels was prepared for them; and they are turned aside from the right path: For he whom God shall cause to err, shall have no director
They shall suffer a punishment in this life; but the punishment of the next shall be more grievous: And there shall be none to protect them against God
This is the description of paradise, which is promised to the pious. It is watered by rivers; its food is perpetual, and its shade also: This shall be the reward of those who fear God. But the reward of the infidels shall be hell fire
Those to whom We have given the scriptures, rejoice at what hath been revealed unto thee. Yet there are some of the confederates who deny part thereof. Say unto them, verily I am commanded to worship God alone; and to give Him no companion: Upon Him do I call, and unto Him shall I return
To this purpose have We sent down the Koran, a rule of judgment, in the Arabic language. And verily if thou follow their desires, after the knowledge which hath been given thee, there shall be none to defend or protect thee against God
We have formerly sent apostles before thee, and bestowed on them wives and children; and no apostle had the power to come with a sign, unless by the permission of God. Every age hath its book of revelation
God shall abolish and shall confirm what he pleaseth. With Him is the original of the book
Moreover, whether We cause thee to see any part of that punishment wherewith we have threatened them, or whether We cause thee to die before it be inflicted on them, verily unto thee belongeth preaching only, but unto us inquisition
Do they not see that We come into their land, and straiten the borders thereof, by the conquests of the true believers? When God judgeth, there is none to reverse his judgment; and He will be swift in taking an account
Their predecessors formerly devised subtle plots against their prophets; but God is master of every subtle device. He knoweth that which every soul deserveth: And the infidels shall surely know, whose will be the reward of paradise
The unbelievers will say, thou art not sent of God. Answer, God is a sufficient witness between me and you, and he who understandeth the scriptures
This book have We sent down unto thee, that thou mayest lead men forth from darkness into light, by the permission of their Lord, into the glorious and laudable way
God is He unto whom belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth: And woe be to the infidels, because a grievous punishment waiteth them
who love the present life above that which is to come, and turn men aside from the way of God, and seek to render it crooked: These are in an error far distant from the truth
We have sent no apostle but with the language of his people, that he might declare their duty plainly unto them: For God causeth to err whom He pleaseth, and directeth whom He pleaseth; and He is the mighty, the wise
We formerly sent Moses with our signs, and commanded him saying, lead forth thy people from darkness into light, and remind them of the favours of God: Verily therein are signs unto every patient and grateful person
And call to mind when Moses said unto his people, remember the favour of God towards you, when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh: They grievously oppressed you, and they slew your male children, but let your females live: Therein was a great trial from your Lord
And when your Lord declared by the mouth of Moses, saying, if ye be thankful, I will surely increase my favours towards you; but if ye be ungrateful, verily my punishment shall be severe
And Moses said, if ye be ungrateful, and all who are in the earth likewise; verily God needeth not your thanks, though He deserveth the highest praise
Hath not the history of the nations your predecessors reached you; namely, of the people of Noah, and of Ad, and of Thamud, and of those who succeeded them; whose number none knoweth except God? Their apostles came unto them with evident miracles; but they clapped their hands to their mouths out of indignation, and said, we do not believe the message with which ye pretend to be sent; and we are in a doubt concerning the religion to which ye invite us, as justly to be suspected
Their apostles answered, is there any doubt concerning God, the creator of heaven and earth? He inviteth you to the true faith that He may forgive you part of your sins, and may respite your punishment, by granting you space to repent, until an appointed time. They answered, ye are but men, like unto us: Ye seek to turn us aside from the gods which our fathers worshipped; wherefore bring us an evident demonstration by some miracle, that ye speak truth
Their apostles replied unto them, we are no other than men like unto you; but God is bountiful unto such of his servants as He pleaseth: And it is not in our power to give you a miraculous demonstration of our mission, unless by the permission of God; in God therfore let the faithful trust
And what excuse have we to allege, that we should not put our trust in God; since He hath directed us our paths? Wherefore we will certainly suffer with patience the persecution wherewith ye shall afflict us: In God therefore let those put their confidence who seek in whom to put their trust
And those who believed not, said unto their apostles, we will surely expel you out of our land; or ye shall return unto our religion. And their Lord spake unto them by revelation, saying, We will surely destroy the wicked doers
and We will cause you to dwell in the earth, after them. This shall be granted unto him who shall dread the appearance at my tribunal, and shall fear my threatening
And they asked assistance of God, and every rebellious perverse person failed of success
Hell lieth unseen before him, and he shall have filthy water given him to drink
He shall sup it up by little and little, and he shall not easily let it pass his throat, because of its nauseousness; death also shall come upon him from every quarter, yet he shall not die; and before him shall there stand prepared a grievous torment
This is the likeness of those who believe not in their Lord. Their works are as ashes, which the wind violently scattereth in a stormy day: They shall not be able to obtain any solid advantage from that which they have wrought. This is an error most distant from truth
Dost thou not see that God hath created the heavens and the earth in wisdom? If He please, he can destroy you, and produce a new creature in your stead
Neither will this be difficult with God
And they shall all come forth into the presence of God at the last day: And the weak among them shall say unto those who behaved themselves arrogantly, verily we were your followers on earth; will ye not therefore avert from us some part of the divine vengeance? They shall answer, if God had directed us aright, we had certainly directed you. It is equal unto us whether we bear our torments impatiently, or whether we endure them with patience: For we have no way to escape
And Satan shall say, after judgment shall have been given, verily God promised you a promise of truth: And I also made you a promise; but I deceived you. Yet I had not any power over you to compel you; but I called you only, and ye answered me: Wherefore accuse not me, but accuse your selves. I cannot assist you; neither can ye assist me. Verily I do now renounce your having associated me with God heretofore. A grievous punishment is prepared for the unjust
But they who shall have believed and wrought righteousness, shall be introduced into gardens, wherein rivers flow; they shall remain therein for ever, by the permission of their Lord; and their salutation therein shall be, Peace
Dost thou not see how God putteth forth a parable; representing a good word, as a good tree, whose root is firmly fixed in the earth, and whose branches reach unto heaven
which bringeth forth its fruit in all seasons, by the will of its Lord? God propoundeth parables unto men, that they may be instructed
And the likeness of an evil word is as an evil tree; which is torn up from the face of the earth, and hath no stability
God shall confirm them who believe, by the stedfast word of faith, both in this life and in that which is to come: But God shall lead the wicked into error; for God doth that which He pleaseth
Hast thou not considered those who have changed the grace of God to infidelity, and cause their people to descend into the house of perdition
namely, into hell? They shall be thrown to burn therein; and an unhappy dwelling shall it be
They also set up idols as copartners with God, that they might cause men to stray from his path. Say unto them, enjoy the pleasures of this life for a time; but your departure hence shall be into hell fire
Speak unto my servants who have believed, that they be assiduous at prayer, and give alms out of that which We have bestowed on them, both privately and in public; before the day cometh, wherein there shall be no buying nor selling, neither any friendship
It is God who hath created the heavens and the earth; and causeth water to descend from heaven, and by means thereof produceth fruits for your sustenance: And by his command He obligeth the ships to sail in the sea for your service; and He also forceth the rivers to supply your uses
He likewise compelleth the sun and the moon, which diligently perform their courses, to serve you; and hath subjected the day and the night to your service
He giveth you of every thing which ye ask him; and of ye attempt to reckon up the favours of God, ye shall not be able to compute the same. Surely man is unjust and ungrateful
Remember when Abraham said, O Lord, make this land a place of security; and grant that I and my children may avoid the worship of idols
for they, O Lord, have seduced a great number of men. Whoever therefore shall follow me, he shall be of me: And whosoever shall disobey me; verily thou wilt be gracious and merciful
O Lord, I have caused some of my offspring to settle in an unfruitful valley, near thy holy house, O Lord, that they may be constant at prayer. Grant, therefore, that the hearts of some men may be affected with kindness towards them; and do thou bestow on them all sorts of fruits; that they may give thanks
O Lord, thou knowest whatsoever we conceal, and whatsoever we publish; for nothing is hidden from God, either on earth, or in heaven
Praise be unto God, who hath given me, in my old age Ismael and Isaac: For my Lord is the hearer of supplication
O Lord, grant that I may be an observer of prayer, and a part of my posterity also, O Lord, and receive my supplication
O Lord, forgive me, and my parents, and the faithful, on the day whereon an account shall be taken
Think not, O prophet, that God is regardless of what the ungodly do. He only deferreth their punishment unto the day whereon mens eyes shall be fixed
They shall hasten forward, at the voice of the angel calling to judgment, and shall lift up their heads; they shall not be able to turn their sight from the object whereon it shall be fixed, and their hearts shall be void of sense, through excessive terror
Wherefore do thou threaten men with the day, whereon their punishment shall be inflicted on them, and whereon those who have acted unjustly shall say, O Lord, give us respite unto a term near at hand; and we will obey thy call, and we will follow thy apostles. But it shall be answered unto them, did ye not swear heretofore, that no reverse should befall you
Yet ye dwelt in the dwellings of those who had treated their own souls unjustly; and it appeared plainly unto you how We had dealt with them; and We propounded their destruction as examples unto you
They employ their utmost subtlety to oppose the truth; but their subtlety is apparent unto God, who is able to frustrate their designs; although their subtlety were so great, that the mountains might be moved thereby
Think not therefore, O prophet, that God will be contrary to his promise of assistance, made unto his apostles; for God is mighty, able to avenge
The day will come, when the earth shall be changed into another earth, and the heavens into other heavens; and men shall come forth from their graves to appear before the only, the mighty God
And thou shalt see the wicked on that day bound together in fetters
Their inner garments shall be of pitch, and fire shall cover their faces
that God may reward every soul, according to what it shall have deserved; for God is swift in taking an account
This is a sufficient admonition unto men, that they may be warned thereby, and that they may know that there is but one God; and that those who are indued with understanding may consider
These are the signs of the book, and of the perspicuous Koran
The time may come when the unbelievers shall wish that they had been Moslems
Suffer them to eat, and to enjoy themselves in this world; and let hope entertain them: But they shall hereafter know their folly
We have not destroyed any city, but a fixed term of repentance was appointed them
No nation shall be punished before their time shall be come; neither shall they be respited after
The Meccans say, O thou to whom the admonition hath been sent down, thou art certainly possessed with a devil
Wouldest thou not have come unto us with an attendance of angels, if thou hadst spoken truth
Answer, we send not down the angels, unless on a just occasion; nor should they be then respited any longer
We have surely sent down the Koran; and We will certainly preserve the same from corruption
We have heretofore sent apostles before thee, among the ancient sects
And there came no apostle unto them, but they laughed him to scorn
In the same manner will we put it into the hearts of the wicked Meccans to scoff at their prophet
They shall not believe on him; and the sentence of the nations of old hath been executed heretofore
If We should open a gate in the heaven above them, and they should ascend thereto all the day long
they would surely say, our eyes are only dazzled; or rather we are a people deluded by enchantments
We have placed the twelve signs in the heaven, and have set them out in various figures, for the observation of spectators
And we guard them from every devil driven away with stones
except him who listeneth by stealth, at whom a visible flame is darted
We have also spread forth the earth, and thrown thereon stable mountains; and we have caused every kind of vegetable to spring forth in the same, according to a determinate weight
And we have provided therein necessaries of life for you, and for him whom ye do not sustain
There is no one thing but the store-houses thereof are in our hands; and We distribute not the same otherwise than in a determinate measure
We also send the winds driving the pregnant clouds, and We send down from heaven water, whereof We give you to drink, and which ye keep not in store
Verily we give life, and We put to death; and We are the heirs of all things
We know those among you who go before; and We know those who stay behind
And thy Lord shall gather them together at the last day; for he is knowing and wise
We created man of dried clay, of black mud, formed into shape
And We had before created the devil of subtile fire
And remember when thy Lord said unto the angels, verily I am about to create man of dried clay, of black mud, wrought into shape
when therefore I shall have completely formed him, and shall have breathed of my spirit into him; do ye fall down and worship him
And all the angels worshipped Adam together
except Eblis, who refused to be with those who worshipped him
And God said unto him, O Eblis, what hindered thee from being with those who worshipped Adam
He answered, it is not fit that I should worship man, whom thou hast created of dried clay, of black mud, wrought into shape
God said, get thee therefore hence; for thou shalt be driven away with stones
And a curse shall be on thee, until the day of judgment
The devil said, O Lord, give me respite until the day of resurrection
God answered, verily thou shalt be one of those who are respited
until the day of the appointed time
The devil replied, O Lord, because thou hast seduced me, I will surely tempt them to disobedience in the earth; and I will seduce them all
except such of them as shall be thy chosen servants
God said, this is the right way with me
Verily as to my servants, thou shalt have no power over them; but over those only who shall be seduced, and who shall follow thee
And hell is surely denounced unto them all
It hath seven gates; unto every gate a distinct company of them shall be assigned
But those who fear God shall dwell in gardens, amidst fountains
The angels shall say unto them, enter ye therein in peace and security
And we will remove all grudges from their breasts; they shall be as brethren, sitting over against one another on couches
Weariness shall not affect them therein, neither shall they be cast out thence for ever
Declare unto my servants that I am the gracious, the merciful God
and that my punishment is a grievous punishment
And relate unto them the history of Abraham's guests
When they went in unto him, and said, peace be unto thee; he answered, verily we are afraid of you
And they replied, fear not; we bring thee the promise of a wise son
He said, do ye bring me the promise of a son now old age hath overtaken me? What is it therefore that ye tell me
They said, we have told thee the truth; be not therefore one of those who despair
He answered, and who despaireth of the mercy of God, except those who err
And he said, what is your errand therefore, O messengers of God
They answered, verily we are sent to destroy a wicked people
But as for the family of Lot, we will save them all
except his wife; we have decreed that she shall be one of those who remain behind to be destroyed with the infidels
And when the messengers came to the family of Lot
he said unto them, verily ye are people who are unknown to me
They answered, but we are come unto thee to execute that sentence, concerning which your fellow citizens doubted
We tell thee a certain truth; and we are messengers of veracity
Therefore lead forth thy family, in some time of the night; and do thou follow behind them, and let none of you turn back; but go whither ye are commanded
And We gave him this command; because the utmost remnant of those people was to be cut off in the morning
And the inhabitants of the city came unto Lot, rejoicing at the news of the arrival of some strangers
And he said unto them, verily these are my guests: Wherefore do not disgrace me by abusing them
but fear God, and put me not to shame
They answered, have we not forbidden thee from entertaining or protecting any man
Lot replied, these are my daughters; therefore rather make use of them, if ye be resolved to do what ye purpose
As thou livest they wander in their folly
Wherefore a terrible storm from heaven assailed them at sun-rise
And We turned the city upside down; and We rained on them stones of baked clay
Verily herein are signs unto men of sagacity
And those cities were punished, to point out a right way for men to walk in
Verily herein is a sign unto the true believers
The inhabitants of the wood near Midian were also ungodly
Wherefore We took vengeance on them. And both of them were destroyed, to serve as a manifest rule for men to direct their actions by
And the inhabitants of Al Hejr likewise heretofore accused the messengers of God of imposture
And We produced our signs unto them, but they retired afar off from the same
And they hewed houses out of mountains, to secure themselves
But a terrible noise from heaven assailed them in the morning
Neither was what they had wrought of any advantage unto them
We have not created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is contained between them, otherwise than in justice: And the hour of judgment shall surely come. Wherefore, O Mohammed, forgive thy people with a gracious forgiveness
Verily thy Lord is the creator of thee and of them, and knoweth what is most expedient
We have already brought unto thee seven verses which are frequently to be repeated, and the glorious Koran
Cast not thine eyes on the good things which We have bestowed on several of the unbelievers, so as to covet the same; neither be thou grieved on their account. Behave thyself with meekness towards the true believers
and say, I am a public preacher
If they believe not, We will inflict a like punishment on them, as We have inflicted on the dividers
who distinguished the Koran into different parts
for by thy Lord, We will demand an account from them all
of that which they have wrought
Wherefore publish that which thou hast been commanded, and withdraw from the idolaters
We will surely take thy part against the scoffers
who associate with God another god; they shall surely know their folly
And now We well know that thou art deeply concerned on account of that which they say
but do thou celebrate the praise of thy Lord; and be one of those who worship
and serve thy Lord, until death shall overtake thee
The sentence of God will surely come to be executed; wherefore do not hasten it. Praise be unto Him! And far be that from Him which they associate with Him
He shall cause the angels to descend with a revelation by his command, unto such of his servants as He pleaseth, saying, preach that there is no God, except myself; therefore fear Me
He hath created the heavens and the earth to manifest his justice: Far be that from Him which they associate with him

And say, truth is come, and falsehood is vanished: For falsehood is of short continuance
We send down of the Koran that which is a medicine and mercy unto the true believers, but it shall only increase the perdition of the unjust
When We bestow favours on man, he retireth and withdraweth himself ungratefully from Us: But when evil toucheth him, he despaireth of our mercy
Say, every one acteth after his own manner: But your Lord best knoweth who is most truly directed in his way
They will ask thee concerning the spirit: Answer, the spirit was created at the command of my Lord: But ye have no knowledge given unto you, except a little
If We pleased, We should certainly take away that which We have revealed unto thee; in such case thou couldest not find any to assist thee therein against Us
unless through mercy from thy Lord; for his favour towards thee hath been great
Say, verily if men and genii were purposely assembled, that they might produce a book like this Koran, they could not produce one like unto it, although the one of them assisted the other
And We have variously propounded unto men in this Koran, every kind of figurative argument; but the greater part of men refuse to receive it, merely out of infidelity
And they say, we will by no means believe on thee, until thou cause a spring of water to gush forth for us out of the earth
or thou have a garden of palm-trees and vines, and thou cause rivers to spring forth from the midst thereof in abundance
or thou cause the heaven to fall down upon us, as thou hast given out, in pieces; or thou bring down God and the angels to vouch for thee
or thou have a house of gold; or thou ascend by a ladder to heaven: Neither will we believe thy ascending thither alone, until thou cause a book to descend unto us, bearing witness of thee, which we may read. Answer, my Lord be praised! Am I other than a man, sent as an apostle
And nothing hindreth men from believing, when a direction is come unto them, except that they say, hath God sent a man for his apostle
Answer, if the angels had walked on earth as familiar inhabitants thereof, We had surely sent down unto them from heaven an angel for our apostle
Say, God is a sufficient witness between me and you: For He knoweth and regardeth his servants
Whom God shall direct, he shall be the rightly directed; and whom He shall cause to err, thou shalt find none to assist, besides him. And We will gather them together on the day of resurrection, creeping on their faces, blind, and dumb, and deaf: Their abode shall be hell; so often as the fire thereof shall be extinguished, We will rekindle a burning flame to torment them
This shall be their reward, because they disbelieve in our signs, and say, when we shall have been reduced to bones and dust, shall we surely be raised new creatures
Do they not perceive that God, who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create other bodies, like their present? And He hath appointed them a limited term; there is no doubt thereof: But the ungodly reject the truth, merely out of unbelief
Say, if ye possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, ye would surely refrain from using them, for fear of spending them; for man is covetous
We heretofore gave unto Moses the power of working nine evident signs. And do thou ask the children of Israel as to the story of Moses; when he came unto them, and Pharaoh said unto him, verily I esteem thee, O Moses, to be deluded by sorcery
Moses answered, thou well knowest that none hath sent down these evident signs except the Lord of heaven and earth; and I surely esteem thee, O Pharaoh, a lost man
Wherefore Pharaoh sought to drive them out of the land; but We drowned him, and all those who were with him
And We said unto the children of Israel, after his destruction, dwell ye in the land: And when the promise of the next life shall come to be fulfilled, We will bring you both promiscuously to judgment
We have sent down the Koran with truth, and it hath descended with truth: And we have not sent thee otherwise than to be a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats
And We have divided the Koran, revealing it by parcels, that thou mightest read it unto men with deliberation; and We have sent it down, causing it to descend as occasion required
Say, whether ye believe therein, or do not believe, verily those who have been favoured with the knowledge of the scriptures which were revealed before it, when the same is rehearsed unto them, fall down on their faces, worshipping
and say, our Lord be praised, for that the promise of our Lord is surely fulfilled
And they fall down on their faces, weeping; and the hearing thereof increaseth their humility
Say, call upon God, or call on the Merciful: By which soever of the two names ye invoke Him, it is equal; for He hath most excellent names. Pronounce not thy prayer aloud, neither pronounce it with too low a voice, but follow a middle way between these
And say, praise be unto God, Who hath not begotten any child; Who hath no partner in the kingdom, nor hath any to protect him from contempt: And magnify Him by proclaiming his greatness
Praise be unto God, who hath sent down unto his servant the book of the Koran, and hath not inserted any crookedness, but hath made it a strait rule
That He should threaten a grievous punishment unto the unbelievers, from his presence; and should bear good tidings unto the faithful, who work righteousness, that they shall receive an excellent reward, namely, paradise
wherein they shall remain for ever
And that He should warn those who say, God hath begotten issue
of which matter they have no knowledge, neither had their fathers. A grievous saying it is, which proceedeth from their mouths: They speak no other than a lie
Peradventure thou wilt kill thy self with grief after them, out of thy earnest zeal for their conversion, if they believe not in this new revelation of the Koran
Verily we have ordained whatsoever is on the earth for the ornament thereof, that we might make trial of men, and see which of them excelleth in works
And we will surely reduce whatever is thereon, to dry dust
Dost thou consider that the companions of the cave, and Al Rakim, were one of our signs, and a great miracle
When the young men took refuge in the cave, they said, O Lord, grant us mercy from before thee, and dispose our business for us to a right issue
Wherefore We struck their ears with deafness, so that they slept without disturbance in the cave for a great number of years
Then We awaked them, that We might know which of the two parties was more exact in computing the space which they had remainded there
We will relate unto thee their history with truth. Verily they were young men who had believed in their Lord; and We had abundantly directed them
And We fortified their hearts with constancy when they stood before the tyrant; and they said, our Lord is the Lord of heaven and earth: We will by no means call on any god besides Him; for then should we surely utter an extravagance
These our fellow people have taken other gods, besides Him; although they bring no demonstrative argument for them: And who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie concerning God
And they said the one to the other, when ye shall separate yourselves from them, and from the deities which they worship, except God, fly into the cave: Your Lord will pour his mercy on you abundantly, and will dispose your business for you to advantage
And thou mightest have seen the sun, when it had risen, to decline from their cave towards the right hand; and when it went down, to leave them on the left hand: And they were in the spacious part of the cave. This was one of the signs of God. Whomsoever God shall direct, he shall be rightly directed; and whomsoever He shall cause to err, thou shalt not find any to defend or to direct
And thou wouldst have judged them to have been awake, while they were sleeping; and We caused them to turn themselves to the right hand, and to the left. And their dog stretched forth his fore-legs in the mouth of the cave: If thou hadst come suddenly upon them, verily thou wouldest have turned thy back and fled from them, and thou wouldest have been filled with fear at the sight of them
And so We awaked them from their sleep, that they might ask questions of one another. One of them spake and said, how long have ye tarried here? They answered, we have tarried a day, or part of a day. The others said, your Lord, best knoweth the time ye have tarried: And now send one of you with this your money into the city, and let him see which of its inhabitants hath the best and cheapest food, and let him bring you provision from him; and let him behave circumspectly, and not discover you to any one
Verily, if they come up against you, they will stone you, or force you to return to their religion; and then shall ye not prosper for ever
And so We made their people acquainted with what had happened to them; that they might know that the promise of God is true, and that there is no doubt of the last hour; when they disputed among themselves concerning their matter. And they said, erect a building over them: Their Lord best knoweth their condition. Those who prevailed in their affair answered, we will surely build a chapel over them
Some say, the sleepers were three; and their dog was the fourth: And others say, they were five; and their dog was the sixth; guessing at a secret matter: And others say, they were seven; and their dog was the eighth. Say, my Lord best knoweth their number: None shall know them, except a few. Wherefore dispute not concerning them, unless with a clear disputation, according to what hath been revealed unto thee: And ask not any of the Christians concerning them
Say not of any matter, I will surely do this to morrow
unless thou add, if God please. And remember thy Lord, when thou forgettest, and say, my Lord is able to direct me with ease, that I may draw near unto the truth of this matter rightly
And they remained in their cave three hundred years, and nine years over
Say, God best knoweth how long they continued there: Unto Him are the secrets of heaven and earth known; do thou make him to see and to hear. The inhabitants thereof have no protector besides Him; neither doth He suffer any one to have a share in the establishment or knowledge of his decree
Read that which hath been revealed unto thee, of the book of thy Lord, without presuming to make any change therein: There is none who hath power to change his words; and thou shalt not find any to fly to, besides Him, if thou attempt it
Behave thy self with constancy towards those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, and who seek his favour; and let not thine eyes be turned away from them, seeking the pomp of this life; neither obey him whose heart We have caused to neglect the remembrance of us, and who followeth his lusts, and leaveth the truth behind him
And say, the truth is from your Lord; wherefore let him who will, believe, and let him who will, be incredulous. We have surely prepared for the unjust hell fire, the flame and smoke whereof shall surround them like a pavilion: And if they beg relief, they shall be relieved with water like molten brass, which shall scald their faces; O how miserable a portion, and how unhappy a couch
As to those who believe, and do good works, we will not suffer the reward of him who shall work righteousness to perish
For them are prepared gardens of eternal abode, which shall be watered by rivers; they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and shall be clothed in green garments of fine silk and brocades; reposing themselves therein on thrones. O how happy a reward, and how easy a couch
And propound unto them as a parable two men: On the one of whom We had bestowed two vineyards, and had surrounded them with palm-trees, and had caused corn to grow between them
Each of the gardens brought forth its fruit every season, and failed not at all; and we caused a river to flow in the midst thereof
And he had great abundance. And he said unto his companion by way of debate, I am superior to thee in wealth, and have a more powerful family
And he went into his garden, being guilty of injustice against his own soul, and said, I do not think that this garden will decay for ever
neither do I think that the last hour will come: And although I should return unto my Lord, verily I shall find a better garden than this in exchange
And his companion said unto him, by way of debate, dost thou not believe in Him who created thee of the dust, and afterwards of seed; and then fashioned thee into a perfect man
But as for me, God is my Lord; and I will not associate any other deity with my Lord
And when thou enterest thy garden, wilt thou not say, what God pleaseth shall come to pass; there is no power but in God alone? Although thou seest me to be inferior to thee in wealth and number of children
my Lord is well able to bestow on me a better gift than thy garden, and to shoot his arrows against the same from heaven, so that it shall become barren dust
or its water may sink deep into the earth, that thou canst not draw thereof
And his possessions were encompassed with destruction, as his companion had forewarned him: Wherefore he began to turn down the palms of his hands out of sorrow and regret for that which he had expended thereon; for the vines thereof were fallen down on their trails: And he said, would to God that I had not associated any other deity with my Lord
And he had no party to assist him, besides God, neither was he able to defend himself against his vengeance
In such case protection belongeth of right unto God alone; He is the best rewarder, and the best giver of success
And propound to them a similitude of the present life. It is like water which We send down from heaven; and the herb of the earth is mixed therewith, and after it hath been green and flourishing, in the morning it becometh dry stubble, which the winds scatter abroad: And God is able to do all things
Wealth and children are the ornaments of this present life: But good works, which are permanent, are better in the sight of thy Lord, with respect to the reward, and better with respect to hope
On a certain day We will cause the mountains to pass away, and thou shalt see the earth appearing plain and even; and We will gather mankind together, and We will not leave any one of them behind
And they shall be set before thy Lord in distinct order, and He shall say unto them, now are ye come unto us naked, as We created you the first time: But ye thought that We should not perform our promise unto you
And the book wherein every one's actions are recorded shall be put into his hand; and thou shalt see the wicked in great terror, because of that which is written therein, and they shall say, Alas for us! What meaneth this book? It omitteth neither a small action nor a great one, but it compriseth the same; and they shall find that which they have wrought, present before their eyes: And thy Lord will not deal unjustly with any one
Remember when We said unto the angels, worship ye Adam: And they all worshipped him, except Eblis, who was one of the genii, and departed from the command of his Lord. Will ye therefore take him and his offspring for your patrons besides Me, notwithstanding they are your enemies? Miserable shall such a change be to the ungodly
I called not them to be present at the creation of the heavens and of the earth, nor at the creation of themselves, neither did I take those seducers for my assistants
On a certain day, God shall say unto the idolaters, call those whom ye imagined to be my companions, to protect you: And they shall call them, but they shall not answer them; and We will place a valley of destruction between them
And the wicked shall see hell fire; and they shall know that they shall be thrown into the same, and they shall find no way to avoid it
And now have We variously propounded unto men, in this Koran, a parable of every kind; but man cavilleth at most things therein
Yet nothing hindreth men from believing, now a direction is come unto them, and from asking pardon of their Lord, excepting that they wait until the punishment of their predecessors come to be inflicted on them, or that the chastisement of the next life come upon them publicly
We send not our messengers, but to bear good tidings, and to denounce threats. Those who believe not, dispute with vain arguments, that they may thereby render the truth of no effect: And they hold my signs, and the admonitions which have been made them, in derision
And who is more unjust than he who hath been acquainted with the signs of his Lord, and retireth afar off from the same, and forgetteth that which his hands have formerly committed? Verily We have cast veils over their hearts, lest they should understand the Koran, and into their ears thickness of hearing: If thou invite them to the true direction, yet will they not therefore be directed for ever
Thy Lord is gracious, indued with mercy; if He would have punished them for that which they have committed, He would doubtless have hastened their punishment: But a threat hath been denounced against them, and they shall find no refuge, besides Him
And those former cities did We destroy, when they acted unjustly; and We gave them previous warning of their destruction
And remember when Moses said unto his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, I will not cease to go forward, until I come to the place where the two seas meet; or I will travel for a long space of time
But when they were arrived at the meeting of the two seas, they forgot their fish, which they had taken with them; and the fish took its way freely in the sea
And when they had passed beyond that place, Moses said unto his servant, bring us our dinner; for now are we fatigued with this our journey
His servant answered, dost thou know what has befallen me? When we took up our lodging at the rock, verily I forgot the fish: And none made me to forget it, except Satan, that I should not remind thee of it. And the fish took its way in the sea, in a wonderful manner
Moses said, this is what we sought after. And they both went back, returning by the way they came
And coming to the rock they found one of our servants, unto whom We had granted mercy from us, and whom We had taught wisdom from before us
And Moses said unto him, shall I follow thee, that thou mayest teach me part of that which thou hast been taught, for a direction unto me
He answered, verily thou canst not bear with me
For how canst thou patiently suffer those things, the knowledge whereof thou dost not comprehend
Moses replied, thou shalt find me patient, if God please; neither will I be disobedient unto thee in any thing
He said, if thou follow me therefore, ask me not concerning any thing, until I shall declare the meaning thereof unto thee
So they both went on by the sea shore, until they went up into a ship; and he made a hole therein. And Moses said unto him, hast thou made a hole therein, that thou mightest drown those who are on board? Now hast thou done a strange thing
He answered, did I not tell thee that thou couldest not bear with me
Moses said, rebuke me not, because I did forget; and impose not on me a difficulty in what I am commanded
Wherefore they left the ship and proceeded, until they met with a youth; and he slew him. Moses said, hast thou slain an innocent person, without his having killed another? Now hast thou committed an unjust action
He answered, did I not tell thee that thou couldest not bear with me
Moses said, if I ask thee concerning any thing hereafter, suffer me not to accompany thee: Now hast thou received an excuse from me
They went forwards therefore, until they came to the inhabitants of a certain city: And they asked food of the inhabitants thereof; but they refused to receive them. And they found therein a wall, which was ready to fall down; and he set it upright. Whereupon Moses said unto him, if thou wouldest, thou mightest doubtless have received a reward for it
He answered, this shall be a separation between me and thee: But I will first declare unto thee the signification of that which thou couldest not bear with patience
The vessel belonged to certain poor men, who did their business in the sea: And I was minded to render it unserviceable, because there was a king behind them, who took every sound ship by force
As to the youth, his parents were true believers; and we feared lest he, being an unbeliever, should oblige them to suffer his perverseness and ingratitude
Wherefore we desired that their Lord might give them a more righteous child in exchange for him, and one more affectionate towards them
And the wall belonged to two orphan youths in the city, and under it was a treasure hidden which belonged to them; and their father was a righteous man: And thy Lord was pleased that they should attain their full age, and take forth their treasure, through the mercy of thy Lord. And I did not what thou hast seen of mine own will, but by God's direction. This is the interpretation of that which thou couldest not bear with patience
The Jews will ask thee concerning Dhu'lkarnein. Answer, I will rehearse unto you an account of him
We made him powerful in the earth, and We gave him means to accomplish every thing he pleased
And he followed his way
until he came to the place where the sun setteth; and he found it to set in a spring of black mud; and he found near the same a certain people. And we said, O Dhu'lkarnein, either punish this people, or use gentleness towards them
He answered, whosoever of them shall commit injustice, we will surely punish him in this world; afterwards shall he return unto his Lord, and He shall punish him with a severe punishment
But whosoever believeth, and doth that which is right, shall receive the most excellent reward, and We will give him in command that which is easy
Then he continued his way
until he came to the place where the sun riseth; and he found it to rise on certain people, unto whom We had not given any thing wherewith to shelter themselves therefrom
Thus it was; and we comprehended with our knowledge the forces which were with him
And he prosecuted his journey from south to north
until he came between the two mountains; beneath which he found certain people, who could scarce understand what was said
And they said, O Dhu'lkarnein, verily Gog and Magog waste the land; shall we therefore pay thee tribute, on condition that thou build a rampart between us and them
He answered, the power wherewith my Lord hath strengthened me, is better than your tribute: But assist me strenuously, and I will set a strong wall between you and them
Bring me iron in large pieces, until it fill up the space between the two sides of these mountains. And he said to the workmen, blow with your bellows, until it make the iron red hot as fire. And he said further, bring me molten brass, that I may pour upon it
Wherefore, when this wall was finished, Gog and Magog could not scale it, neither could they dig through it
And Dhu'lkarnein said, this is a mercy from my Lord: But when the prediction of my Lord shall come to be fulfilled, he shall reduce the wall to dust; and the prediction of my Lord is true
On that day We will suffer some of them to press tumultuously like waves on others; and the trumpet shall be sounded, and We will gather them in a body together
And We will set hell, on that day, before the unbelievers
whose eyes have been veiled from my remembrance, and who could not hear my words
Do the unbelievers think that I will not punish them, for that they take my servants for their protectors besides me? Verily We have prepared hell for the abode of the infidels
Say, shall We declare unto you those whose works are vain
whose endeavour in the present life hath been wrongly directed, and who think they do the work which is right
These are they who believe not in the signs of their Lord, or that they shall be assembled before Him; wherefore their works are vain, and We will not allow them any weight on the day of resurrection
This shall be their reward, namely, hell; for that they have disbelieved, and have held my signs and my apostles in derision
But as for those who believe and do good works, they shall have the gardens of paradise for their abode
they shall remain therein for ever; they shall wish for no change therein
Say, if the sea were ink to write the words of my Lord, verily the sea would fail, before the words of my Lord would fail; although We added another sea like unto it as a farther supply
Say, verily I am only a man as ye are. It is revealed unto me that your God is one only God: Let him therefore who hopeth to meet his Lord, work a righteous work; and let him not make any other to partake in the worship of his Lord
S
A commemoration of the mercy of thy Lord towards his servant Zacharias when he called upon his Lord, invoking him in secret
When he called upon his LORD, invoking him in secret
and said, O Lord, verily my bones are weakened, and my head is become white with hoariness and I have never been unsuccessful in my prayers to thee, O Lord
But now I fear my nephews, who are to succeed after me, for my wife is barren: Wherefore give me a successor of my own body from before thee
who may be my heir, and may be an heir of the family of Jacob; and grant, O Lord, that he may be acceptable unto thee
And the angel answered him, O Zacharias, verily We bring thee tidings of a son, whose name shall be John; We have not caused any to bear the same name before him
Zacharias said, Lord, how shall I have a son, seeing my wife is barren, and I am now arrived at a great age, and am decrepit
The angel said so shall it be: Thy Lord saith, this is easy with Me; since I created thee heretofore, when thou wast nothing
Zacharias answered, O Lord, give me a sign. The angel replied, thy sign shall be, that thou shalt not speak to men for three nights, although thou be in perfect health
And he went forth unto his people, from the chamber, and he made signs unto them, as if he should say, praise ye God in the morning and in the evening
And We said unto his son, O John, receive the book of the law, with a resolution to study and observe it. And We bestowed on him wisdom, when he was yet a child
and mercy from us, and purity of life; and he was a devout person
and dutiful towards his partents, and was not proud or rebellious
Peace be on him the day whereon he was born, and the day whereon he shall die, and the day whereon he shall be raised to life
And remember in the book of the Koran the story of Mary; when she retired from her family to a place towards the east
and took a veil to conceal herself from them; and We sent our spirit Gabriel unto her, and he appeared unto her in the shape of a perfect man
She said, I fly for refuge unto the merciful God, that He may defend me from thee: If thou fearest Him, thou wilt not approach me
He answered, verily I am the messenger of thy Lord, and am sent to give thee a holy son
She said, how shall I have a son, seeing a man hath not touched me, and I am no harlot
Gabriel replied, so shall it be: Thy Lord saith, this is easy with Me; and We will perform it, that We may ordain him for a sign unto men, and a mercy from Us: For it is a thing which is decreed
Wherefore she conceived him: And she retired aside with him in her womb to a distant place
and the pains of childbirth came upon her near the trunk of a palm-tree. She said, would to God I had died before this, and had become a thing forgotten, and lost in oblivion
And He who was beneath her called to her, saying, be not grieved: Now hath God provided a rivulet under thee
and do thou shake the body of the palm-tree, and it shall let fall ripe dates upon thee, ready gathered
And eat, and drink, and calm thy mind. Moreover if thou see any man, and he question thee, say, verily I have vowed a fast unto the merciful; wherefore I will by no means speak to a man this day
So she brought the child to her people, carrying him in her arms. And they said unto her, O Mary, now hast thou done a strange thing
O sister of Aaron, thy father was not a bad man, neither was thy mother a harlot
But she made signs unto the child to answer them; and they said, how shall we speak to him, who is an infant in the cradle
Whereupon the child said, verily I am the servant of God; He hath given me the book of the gospel, and hath appointed me a prophet
And He hath made me blessed, wheresoever I shall be; and hath commanded me to observe prayer, and to give alms, so long as I shall live
and he hath made me dutiful towards my mother, and hath not made me proud, or unhappy
And peace be on me the day whereon I was born, and the day whereon I shall die, and the day whereon I shall be raised to life
This was Jesus the son of Mary; the word of truth, concerning whom they doubt
It is not meet for God, that He should have any son: God forbid! When He decreeth a thing, He only saith unto it, be; and it is
And verily God is my Lord, and your Lord; wherefore serve Him: This is the right way
Yet the sectaries differ among themselves concerning Jesus; but woe be unto those who are unbelievers, because of their appearance at the great day
Do Thou cause them to hear, and do Thou cause them to see, on the day whereon they shall come unto Us to be judged: But the ungodly are this day in a manifest error
And do thou forewarn them of the day of sighing, when the matter shall be determined, while they are now sunk in negligence and do not believe
Verily We will inherit the earth, and whatever creatures are therein; and unto Us shall they all return
And remember Abraham in the book of the Koran; for he was one of great veracity, and a prophet
When he said unto his father, O my father, why dost thou worship that which heareth not, neither seeth, nor profiteth thee at all
O my father, verily a degree of knowledge hath been bestowed on me, which hath not been bestowed on thee: Wherefore follow me; I will lead thee into an even way
O my father, serve not Satan; for Satan was rebellious unto the Merciful
O my father, verily I fear lest a punishment be inflicted on thee from the Merciful, and thou become a companion of Satan
His father answered, dost thou reject my gods, O Abraham? If thou forbear not, I will surely stone thee: Wherefore leave me for a long time
Abraham replied, peace be on thee: I will ask pardon for thee of my Lord; for He is gracious unto me
And I will separate my self from you, and from the idols which ye invoke besides God; and I will call upon my Lord: It may be that I shall not be unsuccessful in calling on my Lord, as ye are in calling upon them
And when he had separated himself from them, and from the idols which they worshipped besides God, We gave him Isaac and Jacob; and We made each of them a prophet
and We bestowed on them, through our mercy, the gift of prophecy, and children, and wealth; and We caused them to deserve the highest commendations
And remember Moses in the book of the Koran: For he was sincerely upright, and was an apostle and a prophet
And We called unto him from the right side of mount Sinai, and caused him to draw near, and to discourse privately with Us
And We gave him, through our mercy, his brother Aaron, a prophet, for his assistant
Remember also Ismael in the same book: For he was true to his promise; and was an apostle, and a prophet
And he commanded his family to observe prayer, and to give alms; and he was acceptable unto his Lord
And remember Edris in the same book; for he was a just person, and a prophet
And we exalted him to a high place
These are they unto whom God hath been bounteous, of the prophets of the posterity of Adam, and of those whom We carried in the ark with Noah; and of the posterity of Abraham, and of Israel, and of those whom We have directed and chosen. When the signs of the Merciful were read unto them, they fell down, worshipping, and wept
But a succeeding generation have come after them, who neglect prayer, and follow their lusts; and they shall surely fall into evil
Except him who repenteth, and believeth, and doth that which is right; these shall enter paradise, and they shall not in the least be wronged
Gardens of perpetual abode shall be their reward, which the Merciful hath promised unto his servants, as an object of faith; for his promise will surely come to be fulfilled
Therein shall they hear no vain discourse, but peace; and their provision shall be prepared for them therein morning and evening
This is paradise, which We will give for an inheritance unto such of our servants as shall be pious
We descend not from heaven, unless by the command of thy Lord: Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is before us, and whatsoever is behind us, and whatsoever is in the intermediate space; neither is thy Lord forgetful of thee
He is the Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatsoever is between them: Wherefore worship Him, and be constant in his worship. Dost thou know any named like Him
Man saith, after I shall have been dead, shall I really be brought forth alive from the grave
Doth not man remember that We created him heretofore, when he was nothing
But by thy Lord We will surely assemble them and the devils to judgment; then will We set them round about hell on their knees
Afterwards We will draw forth from every sect such of them as shall have been a more obstinate rebel against the Merciful
and We best know which of them are more worthy to be burned therein
There shall be none of you but shall descend into the same hell: This is an established decree upon thy Lord
Afterwards We will deliver those who shall have been pious, but We will leave the ungodly therein on their knees
When our manifest signs are read unto them, the infidels say unto the true believers, which of the two parties is in the more eligible condition, and formeth the more excellent assembly
But how many generations have We destroyed before them, which excelled them in wealth, and in outward appearance
Say, whosoever is in error, the Merciful will grant him a long and prosperous life; until they see that with which they are threatened, whether it be the punishment of this life, or that of the last hour; and hereafter they shall know who is in the worse condition, and the weaker in forces
God shall more fully direct those who receive direction; and the good works which remain for ever, are better in the sight of thy Lord than worldly possessions, in respect to the reward, and more eligible in respect to the future recompence
Hast thou seen him who believeth not in our signs, and saith, I shall surely have riches and children bestowed on me
Is he acquainted with the secrets of futurity; or hath he received a covenant from the Merciful that it shall be so
By no means. We will surely write down that which he saith; and increasing We will increase his punishment
And We will be his heir as to that which he speaketh of, and on the last day he shall appear before Us alone and naked
They have taken other gods, besides God, that they may be a glory unto them
By no means. Hereafter shall they deny their worship; and they shall become adversaries unto them
Dost thou not see that we send the devils against the infidels, to incite them to sin by their instigations
Wherefore be not in hast to call down destruction upon them; for we number unto them a determined number of days of respite
On a certain day we will assemble the pious before the Merciful in an honourable manner, as ambassadors come into the presence of a prince
but we will drive the wicked into hell, as cattle are driven to water
They shall obtain no intercession, except he only who hath received a covenant from the Merciful
They say, the Merciful hath begotten issue
Now have ye uttered an impious thing
It wanteth little but that on occasion thereof the heavens be rent, and the earth cleave in sunder, and the mountains be overthrown and fall
for that they attribute children unto the Merciful
whereas it becometh not God to beget children
Verily there is none in heaven or on earth, but shall approach the Merciful as his servant
He encompasseth them by his knowledge and power, and numbereth them with an exact computation
And they shall all come unto him on the day of resurrection, destitute both of helpers and followers
But as for those who believe and do good works, the Merciful will bestow on them love
Verily we have rendered the Koran easy for thy tongue, that thou mayest thereby declare our promises unto the pious, and mayest thereby denounce threats unto contentious people
And how many generations have we destroyed before them? Dost thou find one of them remaining? Or dost thou hear so much as a whisper concerning them
H
We have not sent down the Koran unto thee, that thou shouldest be unhappy
but for an admonition unto him who feareth God
Being sent down from Him who created the earth, and the lofty heavens
The Merciful sitteth on his throne
Unto him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth, and whatsoever is between them, and whatsoever is under the earth
If thou pronounce thy prayers with a loud voice, know that it is not necessary in respect to God; for he knoweth that which is secret, and what is yet more hidden
God! There is no god but he: He hath most excellent names
Hast thou been informed of the history of Moses
When he saw fire, and said unto his family, tarry ye here; for I perceive fire: Peradventure I may bring you a brand thereout, or may find a direction in our way by the fire
And when he was come near unto it, a voice called unto him, saying, O Moses
Verily I am thy Lord: Wherefore put off thy shoes; for thou art in the sacred valley Towa
And I have chosen thee; therefore hearken with attention unto that which is revealed unto thee
Verily I am God; there is no god beside me: Wherefore worship me, and perform thy prayer in remembrance of me
Verily the hour cometh: I will surely manifest the same, that every soul may receive its reward for that which it hath deliberately done
Let not him who believeth not therein, and who followeth his lust, prevent thee from believing in the same, lest thou perish
Now what is that in thy right hand O Moses
He answered, it is my rod whereon I lean, and with which I beat down leaves for my flock; and I have other uses for it
God said unto him, cast it down, O Moses
And he cast it down, and behold, it became a serpent, which ran about
God said, take hold on it, and fear not: We will reduce it to its former condition
And put thy right hand under thy left arm: It shall come forth white, without any hurt. This shall be another sign
That we may shew thee some of our greatest signs
Go unto Pharaoh: For he is exceedingly impious
Moses answered, Lord, enlarge my breast
and make what thou hast commanded me easy unto me
And loose the knot of my tongue
that they may understand my speech
And give me a counsellor of my family
namely, Aaron my brother
Gird up my loins by him
and make him my collegue in the business
That we may praise thee greatly
and may remember thee often
for thou regardest us
God replied, now hast thou obtained thy request, O Moses
And we have heretofore been gracious unto thee
another time; when we revealed unto thy mother that which was revealed unto her, saying
put him into the ark, and cast him into the river, and the river shall throw him on the shore; and my enemy and his enemy shall take him and bring him up; and I bestow on thee love from me, that thou mightest be bred up under my eye
When thy sister went and said, shall I bring you unto one who will nurse the child? So we returned thee unto thy mother, that her mind might be set at ease, and that she might not be afflicted. And thou slewest a soul, and we delivered thee from trouble; and we proved thee by several trials: And afterwards thou didst dwell some years among the inhabitants of Madian. Then thou camest hither according to our decree, O Moses
and I have chosen thee for my self
Wherefore go thou and thy brother with my signs; and be not negligent in remembering me
Go ye unto Pharaoh, for he is excessively impious
And speak mildly unto him; peradventure he will consider, or will fear our threats
They answered, O Lord, verily we fear lest he be precipitately violent against us, or lest he transgress more exorbitantly
God replied, fear not; for I am with you: I will hear and will see
Go ye therefore unto him, and say, verily we are the messengers of thy Lord: Wherefore send the children of Israel with us, and do not afflict them. Now are we come unto thee with a sign from thy Lord: And peace be upon him who shall follow the true direction
Verily it hath been revealed unto us, that a punishment shall be inflicted on him who shall charge us with imposture, and shall turn back. And when they had delivered their message
Pharaoh said, who is your Lord, O Moses
He answered, our Lord is he who giveth all things: He hath created them, and directed them by his providence
Pharaoh said, what therefore is the condition of the former generations
Moses answered, the knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in the book of his decrees: My Lord erreth not, neither doth he forget
It is he who hath spread the earth as a bed for you, and hath made you paths therein; and who sendeth down rain from heaven, whereby we cause various kinds of vegetables to spring forth
saying, eat of part, and feed your cattle with other part thereof. Verily herein are signs unto those who are indued with understanding
Out of the ground have we created you; and to the same will we cause you to return, and we will bring you forth from thence another time
And we shewed Pharaoh all our signs which we had empowered Moses to perform: But he accused him of imposture, and refused to believe
and he said, art thou come unto us that thou mayest dispossess us of our land by thy enchantments, O Moses
Verily we will meet thee with the like enchantments: Wherefore fix an appointment between us and thee; we will not fail it, neither shalt thou, in an equal place
Moses answered, let your appointment be on the day of your solemn feast; and let the people be assembled in open day
And Pharaoh turned away from Moses, and gathered together the most expert magicians, to execute his stratagem; and then came to the appointment
Moses said unto them, woe be unto you! Do not devise a lie against God, lest he utterly destroy you by some judgment: For he shall not prosper who deviseth lies
And the magicians disputed concerning their affair among themselves, and discoursed in private
And they said, these two are certainly magicians: They seek to dispossess you of your land by their sorcery, and to lead away with them your chiefest and most considerable men
Wherefore collect all your cunning, and then come in order: For he shall prosper this day, who shall be superior
They said, O Moses, whether wilt thou cast down thy rod first, or shall we be the first who cast down our rods
He answered, do ye cast down your rods first. And behold, their cords and their rods appeared unto him, by their enchantment, to run about like serpents
Wherefore Moses conceived fear in his heart
But we said unto him, fear not; for thou shalt be superior
Therefore cast down the rod which is in thy right hand; and it shall swallow up the seeming serpents which they have made: For what they have made is only the deceipt of an enchanter; and an enchanter shall not prosper, whithersoever he cometh
And the magicians, when they saw the miracle which Moses performed, fell down and worshipped, saying, we believe in the Lord of Aaron and of Moses
Pharaoh said unto them, do ye believe in him before I give you permission? Verily this is your master, who hath taught you magic. But I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on the opposite sides; and I will crucify you on trunks of palm-trees: And ye shall know which of us is more severe in punishing, and can longer protract your pains
They answered, we will by no means have greater regard unto thee, than unto those evident miracles which have been shewn us, or than unto him who hath created us. Pronounce therefore that sentence against us which thou art about to pronounce: For thou canst only give sentence as to this present life
Verily we believe on our Lord, that he may forgive us our sins, and the sorcery which thou hast forced us to exercise: For God is better to reward, and more able to prolong punishment than thou
Verily whosoever shall appear before his Lord on the day of judgment, polluted with crimes, shall have hell for his reward; he shall not die therein, neither shall he live
But whoever shall appear before him, having been a true believer, and shall have worked righteousness, for these are prepared the highest degrees of happiness
namely, gardens of perpetual abode, which shall be watered by rivers; they shall remain therein for ever: And this shall be the reward of him who shall be pure
And we spake by revelation unto Moses, saying, go forth with my servants out of Egypt by night; and smite the waters with thy rod, and make them a dry path through the sea: Be not apprehensive of Pharaoh's overtaking thee; neither be thou afraid
And when Moses had done so, Pharaoh followed them with his forces; and the waters of the sea which overwhelmed them, overwhelmed them
And Pharaoh caused his people to err, neither did he direct them aright
Thus, O children of Israel, we delivered you from your enemy; and we appointed you the right side of mount Sinai to discourse with Moses and to give him the law; and we caused manna and quails to descend upon you
saying, eat of the good things which we have given you for food; and transgress not therein, lest my indignation fall on you: And on whomsoever my indignation shall fall, he shall go down headlong into perdition
But I will be gracious unto him who shall repent and believe, and shall do that which is right; and who shall be rightly directed
What hath caused thee to hasten from thy people, O Moses, to receive the law
He answered, these follow close on my footsteps; but I have hastened unto thee, O Lord, that thou mightest be well pleased with me
God said, we have already made a trial of thy people, since thy departure; and al Sameri hath seduced them to idolatry
Wherefore Moses returned unto his people in great wrath, and exceedingly afflicted. And he said, O my people, had not your Lord promised you a most excellent promise? Did the time of my absence seem long unto you? Or did ye desire that indignation from your Lord should fall on you, and therefore failed to keep the promise which ye made me
They answered, we have not failed in what we promised thee of our own authority; but we were made to carry in several loads of gold and silver, of the ornaments of the people, and we cast them into the fire; and in like manner al Sameri also cast in what he had collected
and he produced unto them a corporeal calf, which lowed. And al Sameri and his companions said, this is your god, and the god of Moses; but he hath forgotten him, and is gone to seek some other
Did they not therefore see that their idol returned them no answer, and was not able to cause them either hurt or profit
And Aaron had said unto them before, O my people, verily ye are only proved by this calf; for your Lord is the Merciful: Wherefore follow me, and obey my command
They answered, we will by no means cease to be devoted to its worship, until Moses return unto us
And when Moses was returned, he said, O Aaron, what hindered thee, when thou sawest that they went astray
that thou didst not follow me? Hast thou therefore been disobedient to my command
Aaron answered, O son of my mother, drag me not by my beard, nor by the hair of my head. Verily I feared lest thou shouldest say, thou hast made a division among the children of Israel, and thou hast not observed my saying
Moses said unto al Sameri, what was thy design, O Sameri
He answered, I saw that which they saw not; wherefore I took a handful of dust from the footsteps of the messenger of God, and I cast it into the molten calf; for so did my mind direct me
Moses said, get thee gone; for thy punishment in this life shall be, that thou shalt say unto those who shall meet thee, touch me not; and a threat is denounced against thee of more terrible pains, in the life to come, which thou shalt by no means escape. And behold now thy god, to whose worship thou hast continued assiduously devoted: Verily we will burn it; and we will reduce it to powder, and scatter it in the sea
Your God is the true God, besides whom there is no other god: He comprehendeth all things by his knowledge
Thus do we recite unto thee, O Mohammed, relations of what hath passed heretofore; and we have given thee an admonition from us
He who shall turn aside from it, shall surely carry a load of guilt on the day of resurrection
They shall continue thereunder for ever; and a grievous burden shall it be unto them on the day of resurrection
On that day the trumpet shall be sounded; and we will gather the wicked together on that day, having grey eyes
They shall speak with a low voice to one another, saying, ye have not tarried above ten days
We well know what they will say; when the most conspicuous among them for behaviour shall say, ye have not tarried above one day
They will ask thee concerning the mountains: Answer, my Lord will reduce them to dust, and scatter them abroad
and he will leave them a plain equally extended
Thou shalt see no part of them higher or lower than another
On that day mankind shall follow the angel who will call them to judgment, none shall have power to turn aside from him; and their voices shall be low before the Merciful, neither shalt thou hear any more than the hollow sound of their feet
On that day the intercession of none shall be of advantage unto another, except the intercession of him to whom the Merciful shall grant permission, and who shall be acceptable unto him in what he saith
God knoweth that which is before them, and that which is behind them; but they comprehend not the same by their knowledge
And their faces shall be humbled before the living, the self-subsisting God; and he shall be wretched who shall bear his iniquity
But whosoever shall do good works, being a true believer, shall not fear any injustice, or any diminution of his reward from God
And thus have we sent down this book, being a Koran in the Arabic tongue; and we have inserted various threats and promises therein, that men may fear God, or that it may awaken some consideration in them
Wherefore let God be highly exalted, the king, the truth! Be not overhasty in receiving or repeating the Koran, before the revelation thereof be completed unto thee; and say, Lord, increase my knowledge
We heretofore gave a command unto Adam; but he forgot the same, and ate of the forbidden fruit; and we found not in him a firm resolution
And remember when we said unto the angels, worship ye Adam; and they worshipped him: But Eblis refused
And we said, O Adam, verily this is an enemy unto thee, and thy wife: Wherefore beware lest he turn you out of paradise; for then shalt thou be miserable
Verily we have made a provision for thee, that thou shalt not hunger therein, neither shalt thou be naked
And there is also a provision made for thee, that thou shalt not thirst therein, neither shalt thou be incommoded by heat
But Satan whispered evil suggestions unto him, saying, O Adam, shall I guide thee to the tree of eternity, and a kingdom which faileth not
And they both ate thereof: And their nakedness appeared unto them; and they began to sew together the leaves of paradise, to cover themselves. And thus Adam became disobedient unto his Lord, and was seduced
Afterwards his Lord accepted him, on his repentance, and was turned unto him, and directed him
And God said, get ye down hence, all of you: The one of you shall be an enemy unto the other. But hereafter shall a direction come unto you from me: And whosoever shall follow my direction, shall not err, neither shall he be unhappy
but whosoever shall turn aside from my admonition, verily he shall lead a miserable life, and we will cause him to appear before us on the day of resurrection, blind
And he shall say, O Lord, why hast thou brought me before thee blind, whereas before I saw clearly
God shall answer, thus have we done, because our signs came unto thee, and thou didst forget them; and in the same manner shalt thou be forgotten this day
And thus will we reward him who shall be negligent, and shall not believe in the signs of his Lord: And the punishment of the life to come shall be more severe, and more lasting, than the punishment of this life
Are not the Meccans therefore acquainted how many generations we have destroyed before them; in whose dwellings they walk? Verily herein are signs unto those who are indued with understanding
And unless a decree had previously gone forth from thy Lord for their respite, verily their destruction had necessarily followed: But there is a certain time determined by God for their punishment
Wherefore do thou, O Mohammed, patiently bear that which they say; and celebrate the praise of thy Lord before the rising of the sun, and before the setting thereof, and praise him in the hours of the night, and in the extremities of the day, that thou mayest be well pleased with the prospect of receiving favour from God
And cast not thine eyes on that which we have granted divers of the unbelievers to enjoy, namely, the splendor of this present life, that we may prove them thereby: For the provision of thy Lord is better, and more permanent
Command thy family to observe prayer; and do thou persevere therein. We require not of thee that thou labour to gain necessary provisions for thyself and family: We will provide for thee; for the prosperous issue shall attend on piety
The unbelievers say, unless he come unto us with a sign from his Lord, we will not believe on him. Hath not a plain declaration come unto them, of that which is contained in the former volumes of scripture, by the revelation of the Koran
If we had destroyed them by a judgment before the same had been revealed, they would have said, at the resurrection, O Lord, how could we believe since thou didst not send unto us an apostle, that we might follow thy signs, before we were humbled and covered with shame
Say, each of us wait the issue: Wait therefore; for ye shall surely know hereafter who have been the followers of the even way, and who hath been rightly directed
The time of giving up their account draweth nigh unto the people of Mecca; while they are sunk in negligence, turning aside from the consideration thereof
No admonition cometh unto them from their Lord, being lately revealed in the Koran, but when they hear it, they turn it to sport
Their hearts are taken up with delights. And they who act unjustly discourse privately together, saying, is this Mohammed any more than a man like yourselves? Will ye therefore come to hear a piece of sorcery, when ye plainly perceive it to be so
Say, my Lord knoweth whatever is spoken in heaven and on earth: It is He who heareth and knoweth
But they say, the Koran is a confused heap of dreams: Nay, he hath forged it; nay, he is a poet: Let him come unto us therefore with some miracle, in like manner as the former prophets were sent
None of the cities which We have destroyed, believed the miracles which they saw performed, before them: Will these therefore believe, if they see a miracle
We sent none as our apostles before thee, other than men, unto whom We revealed our will. Ask those who are acquainted with the scripture, if ye know not this
We gave them not a body which could be supported without their eating food; neither were they immortal
But We made good our promise unto them: Wherefore We delivered them, and those whom We pleased; but We destroyed the exorbitant transgressors
Now have We sent down unto you, O Koreish, the book of the Koran; wherein there is honourable mention of you: Will ye not therefore understand
And how many cities have We overthrown, which were ungodly; and caused other nations to rise up after them
And when they felt our severe vengeance, behold, they fled swiftly from those cities
And the angels said, scoffingly, unto them, do not fly; but return to that wherein ye delighted, and to your habitations: Peradventure ye will be asked
They answered, alas for us! Verily we have been unjust
And this their lamentation ceased not, until we had rendered them like corn which is mowen down, and utterly extinct
We created not the heavens and the earth, and that which is between them, by way of sport
If We had pleased to take diversion, verily We had taken it with that which beseemeth Us; if We had resolved to have done this
But We will oppose truth to vanity, and it shall confound the same; and behold, it shall vanish away. Woe be unto you, for that which ye impiously utter concerning God
Since whoever is in heaven and on earth is subject unto Him; and the angels who are in his presence do not insolently disdain his service, neither are they tired therewith
They praise Him night and day: They faint not
Have they taken gods from the earth? Shall they raise the dead to life
If there were either in heaven or on earth gods besides God, verily both would be corrupted. But far be that which they utter, from God, the Lord of the throne
No account shall be demanded of Him for what He shall do; but an account shall be demanded of them
Have they taken other gods besides Him? Say, produce your proof thereof. This is the admonition of those who are contemporary with me, and the admonition of those who have been before me: But the greater part of them know not the truth, and turn aside from the same
We have sent no apostle before thee, but We revealed unto him that there is no god besides myself: Wherefore serve Me
They say, the Merciful hath begotten issue; and the angels are his daughters. God forbid! They are his honoured servants
They prevent Him not in any thing which they say; and they execute his command
He knoweth that which is before them, and that which is behind them: They shall not intercede for any, except for whom it shall please Him; and they tremble for fear of Him
Whoever of them shall say, I am a god besides Him; that angel will We reward with hell: For so will We reward the unjust
Do not the unbelievers therefore know, that the heavens and the earth were solid, and We clave the same in sunder; and made every living thing of water? Will they not therefore believe
And We placed stable mountains on the earth, lest it should move with them; and We made broad passages between them for paths, that they might be directed in their journeys
And We made the heaven a roof well supported. Yet they turn aside from the signs thereof, not considering that they are the workmanship of God
It is He who hath created the night, and the day, and the sun, and the moon; all the celestial bodies move swiftly, each in its respective orb
We have not granted unto any man before thee, eternal permanency in this world; if thou die therefore, will they be immortal
Every soul shall taste of death: And We will prove you with evil, and with good, for a trial of you; and unto Us shall ye return
When the unbelievers see thee, they receive thee only with scoffing, saying, is this he who mentioneth your gods with contempt? Yet themselves believe not what is mentioned to them of the Merciful
Man is created of precipitation. Hereafter will I shew you my signs, so that ye shall not wish them to be hastened
They say, when will this threat be accomplished, if ye speak truth
If they who believe not, knew that the time will surely come, then they shall not be able to drive back the fire of hell from their faces, nor from their backs, neither shall they be helped, they would not hasten it
But the day of vengeance shall come upon them suddenly, and shall strike them with astonishment: They shall not be able to avert it; neither shall they be respited
Other apostles have been mocked before thee: But the punishment which they scoffed at, fell upon such of them as mocked
Say unto the scoffers, who shall save you by night and by day from the Merciful? Yet they utterly neglect the remembrance of their Lord
Have they gods who will defend them, besides us? They are not able to help themselves; neither shall they be assisted against us by their companions
But We have permitted these men and their fathers to enjoy worldly prosperity, so long as life was continued unto them. Do they not perceive that We come unto the land of the unbelievers, and straiten the borders thereof? Shall they therefore be the conquerors
Say, I only preach unto you the revelation of God: But the deaf will not hear thy call, whenever they are preached unto
Yet if the least breath of the punishment of thy Lord touch them, they will surely say, alas for us! Verily we have been unjust
We will appoint just balances for the day of resurrection; neither shall any soul be injured at all: Although the merit or guilt of an action be of the weight of a grain of mustard-seed only, We will produce it publicly; and there will be sufficient accountants with Us
We formerly gave unto Moses and Aaron the law, being a distinction between good and evil, and a light and admonition unto the pious
who fear their Lord in secret, and who dread the hour of judgment
And this book also is a blessed admonition; which We have sent down from heaven: Will ye therefore deny it
And We gave unto Abraham his direction heretofore, and We knew him to be worthy of the revelations wherewith he was favoured
Remember when he said unto his father, and his people, what are these images, to which ye are so entirely devoted
They answered, we found our fathers worshipping them
He said, verily both ye and your fathers have been in a manifest error
They said, dost thou seriously tell us the truth, or art thou one who jestest with us
He replied, verily your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth; it is He who hath created them: And I am one of those who bear witness thereof
By God, I will surely devise a plot against your idols, after ye shall have retired from them, and shall have turned your backs
And in the peoples absence he went into the temple where the idols stood, and he brake them all in pieces, except the biggest of them; that they might lay the blame upon that. And when they were returned
and saw the havock which had been made, they said, who hath done this to our gods? He is certainly an impious person
And certain of them answered, we heard a young man speak reproachfully of them: He is named Abraham
They said, bring him therefore before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness against him
And when he was brought before the assembly, they said unto him, hast thou done this unto our gods, O Abraham
He answered, nay, that biggest of them hath done it: But ask them, if they can speak
And they returned unto themselves, and said the one to the other, verily ye are the impious persons
Afterwards they relapsed into their former obstinacy, and said, verily thou knowest that these speak not
Abraham answered, do ye therefore worship, besides God, that which cannot profit you at all, neither can it hurt you
Fie on you; and upon that which ye worship besides God! Do ye not understand
They said, burn him, and avenge your gods: If ye do this it will be well
And when Abraham was cast into the burning pile, We said, O fire, be thou cold, and a preservation unto Abraham
And they sought to lay a plot against him: But We caused them to be the sufferers
And We delivered him, and Lot, by bringing them into the land wherein We have blessed all creatures
And We bestowed on him Isaac, and Jacob, as an additional gift: And We made all of them rightous persons
We also made them models of religion, that they might direct others by our command: And We inspired into them the doing of good works, and the observance of prayer, and the giving of alms; and they served us
And unto Lot We gave wisdom and knowledge, and We delivered him out of the city which committed filthy crimes; for they were a wicked and insolent people
And We led him into our mercy; for he was an upright person
And remember Noah, when he called for destruction on his people, before the prophets abovementioned; and We heard him, and delivered him and his family from a great strait
And We protected him from the people who accused our signs of falsehood; for they were a wicked people, wherefore We drowned them all
And remember David, and Solomon, when they pronounced judgment concerning a field, when the sheep of certain people had fed therein by night, having no shepherd; and We were witnesses of their judgment
And We gave the understanding thereof unto Solomon. And on all of them We bestowed wisdom, and knowledge. And We compelled the mountains to praise Us with David; and the birds also: And We did this
And We taught him the art of making coats of mail for you, that they may defend you in your wars: Will ye therefore be thankful
And unto Solomon We subjected a strong wind; it ran at his command to the land whereon We had bestowed our blessing: And We knew all things
And We also subjected unto his command divers of the devils, who might dive to get pearls for him, and perform other work besides this; and We watched over them
And remember Job; when he cried unto his Lord, saying, verily evil hath afflicted me: But thou art the most merciful of those who shew mercy
Wherefore We heard him, and relieved him from the evil which was upon him: And We restored unto him his family, and as many more with them, through our mercy, and for an admonition unto those who serve God
And remember Ismael, and Edris, and Dhu'lkefl. All these were patient persons
Wherefore We led them into our mercy; for they were righteous doers
And remember Dhu'lnun, when he departed in wrath, and thought that We could not exercise our power over him. And he cried out in the darkness, saying, there is no God, besides Thee: Praise be unto Thee! Verily I have been one of the unjust
Wherefore We heard him, and delivered him from affliction: For so do We deliver the true believers
And remember Zacharias, when he called upon his Lord, saying, O Lord, leave me not childless: Yet thou art the best heir
Wherefore We heard him, and We gave him John; and We rendered his wife fit for bearing a child unto him. These strove to excel in good works, and called upon us with love, and with fear; and humbled themselves before us
And remember her who preserved her virginity, and into whom We breathed of our spirit; ordaining her and her son for a sign unto all creatures
Verily this your religion is one religion; and I am your Lord; wherefore serve Me
But the Jews and Christians have made schisms in the affair of their religion among themselves: But all of them shall appear before us
Whosoever shall do good works, being a true believer, there shall be no denial of the reward due to his endeavours; and We will surely write it down unto him
An inviolable prohibition is laid on every city which We shall have destroyed
for that they shall not return any more into the world; until Gog and Magog shall have a passage opened for them, and they shall hasten from every high hill
and the certain promise shall draw near to be fulfilled: And behold, the eyes of the infidels shall be fixed with astonishment, and they shall say, alas for us! We were formerly regardless of this day; yea, we were wicked doers
Verily both ye, O men of Mecca, and the idols which ye worship besides God, shall be cast as fuel into hell fire: Ye shall go down into the same
If these were really gods, they would not go down into the same: And all of them shall remain therein for ever
In that place shall they groan for anguish; and they shall not hear ought therein
As for those unto whom the most excellent reward of paradise hath been predestinated by us, they shall be transported far off from the same
they shall not hear the least sound thereof: And they shall continue for ever in the felicity which their souls desire
The greatest terror shall not trouble them, and the angels shall meet them to congratulate them, saying, this is your day which ye were promised
On that day We will roll up the heavens, as the angel al Sijil rolleth up the book wherein every man's actions are recorded. As We made the first creature out of nothing, so We will also reproduce it at the resurrection. This is a promise which it lieth on Us to fulfil: We will surely perform it
And now have We written in the psalms, after the promulgation of the law, that my servants the righteous shall inherit the earth
Verily in this book are contained sufficient means of salvation, unto people who serve God
We have not sent thee, O Mohammed, but as a mercy unto all creatures
Say, no other hath been revealed unto me, than that your God is one God: Will ye therefore be resigned unto Him
But if they turn their backs to the confession of God's unity, say, I proclaim war against you all equally: But I know not whether that which ye are theatened with be nigh, or whether it be far distant
Verily God knoweth the discourse which is spoken in public; and He also knoweth that which ye hold in private
I know not but peradventure the respite granted you is for a trial of you; and that ye may enjoy the prosperity of this world for a time
Say, Lord, judge between me and my adversaries with truth. Our Lord is the Merciful; whose assistance is to be implored against the blasphemies and calumnies which ye utter
O men of Mecca, fear your Lord. Verily the shock of the last hour will be a terrible thing
On the day whereon ye shall see it, every woman who giveth suck shall forget the infant which she suckleth, and every female that is with young shall cast her burden; and thou shalt see men seemingly drunk, yet they shall not be really drunk: But the punishment of God will be severe
There is a man who disputeth concerning God without knowledge, and followeth every rebellious devil
Against whom it is written, that whoever shall take him for his patron, he shall surely seduce him, and shall lead him into the torment of hell
O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that We first created you of the dust of the ground; afterwards, of seed; afterwards, of a little coagulated blood; afterwards, of a piece of flesh, perfectly formed in part, and in part imperfectly formed; that We might make our power manifest unto you: And We cause that which We please to rest in the wombs, until the appointed time of delivery. Then We bring you forth infants; and afterwards We permit you to attain your age of full strength: And one of you dieth in his youth, and another of you is postponed to a decrepit age, so that he forgetteth whatever he knew. Thou seest the earth sometimes dried up and barren: But when We send down rain thereon, it is put in motion, and swelleth, and produceth every kind of luxuriant vegetables
This sheweth that God is the truth, and that He raiseth the dead to life, and that He is almighty
and that the hour of judgment will surely come, (there is no doubt thereof), and that God will raise again those who are in the graves
There is a man who disputeth concerning God without either knowledge, or a direction, or an enlightening book
proudly turning his side, that he may seduce men from the way of God. Ignominy shall attend him in this world; and on the day of resurrection We will make him taste the torment of burning
when it shall be said unto him, this thou sufferest because of that which thy hands have formerly committed; for God is not unjust towards mankind
There are some men who serve God in a wavering manner, standing, as it were, on the verge of the true religion. If good befall one of them, he resteth satisfied therein; but if any tribulation befall him, he turneth himself round, with the loss both of this world, and of the life to come. This is manifest perdition
He will call upon that, besides God, which can neither hurt him, nor profit him. This is an error remote from truth
He will invoke him who will sooner be of hurt to his worshipper than of advantage. Such is surely a miserable patron, and a miserable companion
But God will introduce those who shall believe, and do righteous works, into gardens through which rivers flow; for God doth that which He pleaseth
Whoso thinketh that God will not assist his apostle in this world, and in the world to come, let him strain a rope towards heaven, then let him put an end to his life, and see whether his devices can render that ineffectual, for which he was angry
Thus do We send down the Koran, being evident signs; for God directeth whom He pleaseth
As to the true believers, and those who judaize, and the Sabians, and the Christians, and Magians, and the idolaters; verily God shall judge between them on the day of resurrection; for God is witness of all things
Dost thou not perceive that all creatures both in heaven and on earth adore God; and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the beasts, and many men? But many are worthy of chastisement: And whomsoever God shall render despicable, there shall be none to honour; for God doth that which He pleaseth
These are two opposite parties, who dispute concerning their Lord. And they who believe not, shall have garments of fire fitted unto them: boiling water shall be poured on their heads
their bowels shall be dissolved thereby, and also their skins
and they shall be beaten with maces of iron
So often as they shall endeavour to get out of hell, because of the anguish of their torments, they shall be dragged back into the same; and their tormentors shall say unto them, taste ye the pain of burning
God will introduce those who shall believe, and act righteously, into gardens through which rivers flow: They shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and pearls; and their vestures therein shall be silk
They are directed unto a good saying; and are directed into the honourable way
But they who shall disbelieve, and obstruct the way of God, and hinder men from visiting the holy temple of Mecca, which We have appointed for a place of worship unto all men: The inhabitant thereof, and the stranger have an equal right to visit it: And whosoever shall seek impiously to profane it, We will cause him to taste a grievous torment
Call to mind when We gave the site of the house of the Caaba for an abode unto Abraham, saying, do not associate any thing with Me; and cleanse my house for those who compass it, and who stand up, and who bow down to worship
And proclaim unto the people a solemn pilgrimage; let them come unto thee on foot, and on every lean camel, arriving from every distant road
that they may be witnesses of the advantages which accrew to them from the visiting this holy place, and may commemorate the name of God on the appointed days, in gratitude for the brute cattle which He hath bestowed on them. Wherefore eat thereof, and feed the needy, and the poor
Afterwards let them put an end to the neglect of their persons; and let them pay their vows, and compass the ancient house
This let them do. And whoever shall regard the sacred ordinances of God; this will be better for him in the sight of his Lord. All sorts of cattle are allowed you to eat, except what hath been read unto you, in former passages of the Koran, to be forbidden. But depart from the abomination of idols, and avoid speaking that which is false: Being orthodox in respect to God
associating no other god with Him; for whoever associateth any other with God, is like that which falleth from heaven, and which the birds snatch away, or the wind bloweth to a far distant place
This is so. And whoso maketh valuable offerings unto God; verily they proceed from the piety of men's hearts
Ye receive various advantages from the cattle designed for sacrifices, until a determined time for slaying them: Then the place of sacrificing them is at the ancient house
Unto the professors of every religion have We appointed certain rites, that they may commemorate the name of God on slaying the brute cattle which He hath provided for them. Your God is one God: Wherefore resign your selves wholly unto Him. And do thou bear good tidings unto those who humble themselves
whose hearts, when mention is made of God, are struck with fear; and unto those who patiently endure that which befalleth them; and who duely perform their prayers, and give alms out of what We have bestowed on them
The camels slain for sacrifice have We appointed for you as symbols of your obedience unto God: Ye also receive other advantages from them. Wherefore commemorate the name of God over them, when ye slay them, standing on their feet disposed in right order: And when they are fallen down dead, eat of them; and give to eat thereof both unto him who is content with what is given him, without asking, and unto him who asketh. Thus have We given you dominion over them, that ye might return Us thanks
Their flesh is not accepted of God, neither their blood; but your piety is accepted of Him. Thus have We given you dominion over them, that ye might magnify God, for the revelations whereby He hath directed you. And bear good tidings unto the righteous
that God will repel the ill designs of the infidels from the true believers; for God loveth not every perfidious unbeliever
Permission is granted unto those who take arms against the unbelievers, for that they have been unjustly persecuted by them: -- (and God is certainly able to assist them)
Who have been turned out of their habitations injuriously, and for no other reason than because they say, our Lord is God. And if God did not repel the violence of some men by others, verily monasteries, and churches, and synagogues, and the temples of the Moslems, wherein the name of God is frequently commemorated, would be utterly demolished. And God will certainly assist him who shall be on his side: For God is strong and mighty
And He will assist those who, if We establish them in the earth, will observe prayer, and give alms, and command that which is just, and forbid that which is unjust. And unto God shall be the end of all things
If they accuse thee, O Mohammed, of imposture; consider that, before them, the people of Noah, and the tribes of Ad and Thamud
and the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot
and the inhabitants of Madian, accused their prophets of imposture: And Moses was also charged with falsehood. And I granted a long respite unto the unbelievers: But afterwards I chastised them; and how different was the change I made in their condition
How many cities have We destroyed, which were ungodly, and which are now fallen to ruin on their roofs? And how many wells have been abandoned, and lofty castles
Do they not therefore journey through the land? And have they not hearts to understand with, or ears to hear with? Surely as to these things their eyes are not blind, but the hearts are blind which are in their breasts
They will urge thee to hasten the threatened punishment; but God will not fail to perform what He hath threatened: And verily one day with thy Lord is as a thousand years, of those which ye compute
Unto how many cities have I granted respite, though they were wicked? Yet afterwards I chastised them: And unto Me shall they come to be judged, at the last day
Say, O men, verily I am only a public preacher unto you
And they who believe, and do good works, shall obtain forgiveness and an honourable provision
But those who endeavour to make our signs of none effect, shall be the inhabitants, of hell
We have sent no apostle, or prophet, before thee, but, when he read, Satan suggested some error in his reading. But God shall make void that which Satan hath suggested: Then shall God confirm his signs; for God is knowing and wise
But this He permitteth, that He may make that which Satan hath suggested, a temptation unto those in whose hearts there is an infirmity, and whose hearts are hardened: -- for the ungodly are certainly in a wide disagreement from the truth
And that they on whom knowledge hath been bestowed, may know that this book is the truth from thy Lord, and may believe therein; and that their hearts may acquiesce in the same: For God is surely the director of those who believe, into the right way
But the infidels will not cease to doubt concerning it, until the hour of judgment cometh suddenly upon them; or until the punishment of a grievous day overtake them
On that day the kingdom shall be God's: He shall judge between them. And they who shall have believed, and shall have wrought righteousness, shall be in gardens of pleasure
But they who shall have disbelieved, and shall have charged our signs with falsehood, those shall suffer a shameful punishment
And as to those who shall have fled their country for the sake of God's true religion, and afterwards shall have been slain, or shall have died; on them will God bestow an excellent provision; and God is the best provider
He will surely introduce them with an introduction with which they shall be well-pleased: For God is knowing and gracious
This is so. Whoever shall take a vengeance equal to the injury which hath been done him, and shall afterwards be unjustly treated; verily God will assist him: For God is merciful, and ready to forgive
This shall be done, for that God causeth the night to succeed the day, and He causeth the day to succeed the night; and for that God both heareth and seeth
This, because God is truth, and because what they invoke besides Him, is vanity; and for that God is the high, the mighty
Dost thou not see that God sendeth down water from heaven, and the earth becometh green? For God is gracious and wise
Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in heaven and on earth: And God is self-sufficient, worthy to be praised
Dost thou not see that God hath subjected whatever is in the earth to your service, and also the ships which sail in the sea, by his command? And He with-holdeth the heaven that it fall not on the earth, unless by his permission: For God is gracious unto mankind, and merciful
It is He who hath given you life, and will hereafter cause you to die; afterwards He will again raise you to life, at the resurrection: But man is surely ungrateful
Unto the professors of every religion have We appointed certain rites, which they observe. Let them not therefore dispute with thee concerning this matter; but invite them unto thy Lord: For thou followest the right direction
But if they enter into debate with thee, answer, God well knoweth that which ye do
God will judge between you, on the day of resurrection, concerning that wherein ye now disagree
Dost thou not know that God knoweth whatever is in heaven and on earth? Verily this is written in the book of his decrees: This is easy with God
They worship, besides God, that concerning which He hath sent down no convincing proof, and concerning which they have no knowledge: But the unjust doers shall have none to assist them
And when our evident signs are rehearsed unto them, thou mayest perceive, in the countenances of the unbelievers, a disdain thereof: It wanteth little but that they rush with violence on those who rehearse our signs unto them. Say, shall I declare unto you a worse thing than this? The fire of hell, which God hath threatened unto those who believe not, is worse; and an unhappy journey shall it be thither
O men, a parable is propounded unto you; wherefore hearken unto it. Verily the idols which ye invoke, besides God, can never create a single fly, although they were all assembled for that purpose: And if the fly snatch any thing from them, they cannot recover the same from it. Weak is the petitioner, and the petitioned
They judge not of God according to his due estimation: For God is powerful and mighty
God chooseth messengers from among the angels, and from among men: For God is He who heareth and seeth
He knoweth that which is before them, and that which is behind them: And unto God shall all things return
O true believers, bow down, and prostrate your selves, and worship your Lord; and work righteousness, that ye may be happy
And fight in defence of God's true religion, as it behoveth you to fight for the same. He hath chosen you, and hath not imposed on you any difficulty in the religion which He hath given you, the religion of your father Abraham: He hath named you Moslems heretofore, and in this book; that our apostle may be a witness against you at the day of judgment, and that ye may be witnesses against the rest of mankind. Wherefore be ye constant at prayer; and give alms: And adhere firmly unto God. He is your master; and He is the best master, and the best protector
Now are the true believers happy
Who humble themselves in their prayer
and who eschew all vain discourse
and who are doers of alms-deeds
and who keep themselves from carnal knowledge of any women
except their wives, or the captives which their right hands possess; -- for as to them they shall be blameless
But whoever coveteth any woman beyond these, they are transgressors
And who acquit themselves faithfully of their trust, and justly perform their covenant
and who observe their appointed times of prayer
These shall be the heirs
who shall inherit paradise; they shall continue therein for ever
We formerly created man of a finer sort of clay
afterwards We placed him in the form of seed in a sure receptacle
Afterwards We made the seed coagulated blood; and We formed the coagulated blood into a piece of flesh: Then We formed the piece of flesh into bones; and We cloathed those bones with flesh: Then We produced the same by another creation. Wherefore blessed be God, the most excellent creator
After this shall ye die
And afterwards shall ye be restored to life, on the day of resurrection
And We have created over you seven heavens: And We are not negligent of what We have created
And We send down rain from heaven, by measure; and We cause it to remain on the earth: We are also certainly able to deprive you of the same
And We cause gardens of palm-trees, and vineyards, to spring forth for you by means thereof; wherein ye have many fruits, and whereof ye eat
And We also raise for you a tree springing from mount Sinai; which produceth oil, and a sauce for those who eat
Ye have likewise an instruction in the cattle: We give you to drink of the milk which is in their bellies, and ye receive many advantages from them; and of them do ye eat
And on them, and on ships, are ye carried
We sent Noah heretofore unto his people, and he said, O my people, serve God: Ye have no God besides Him; will ye not therefore fear the consequence of your worshipping other gods
And the chiefs of his people, who believed not, said, this is no other than a man, as ye are: He seeketh to raise himself to a superiority over you. If God had pleased to have sent a messenger unto you, He would surely have sent angels: We have not heard this of our forefathers
Verily he is no other than a man disturbed with frenzy: Wherefore wait concerning him for a time
Noah said, O Lord, do thou protect me; for that they accuse me of falsehood
And We revealed our orders unto him, saying, make the ark in our sight; and according to our revelation. And when our decree cometh to be executed, and the oven shall boil and pour forth water, carry into it of every species of animals one pair; and also thy family, except such of them on whom a previous sentence of destruction hath passed: And speak not unto Me in behalf of those who have been unjust; for they shall be drowned
And when thou and they who shall be with thee, shall go up into the ark, say, praise be unto God, who hath delivered us from the ungodly people
And say, O Lord, cause me to come down from this ark with a blessed descent; for thou art best able to bring me down from the same with safety
Verily herein were signs of our omnipotence; and We proved mankind thereby
Afterwards We raised up another generation after them
and We sent unto them an apostle from among them, who said, worship God: Ye have no God besides Him; will ye not therefore fear his vengeance
And the chiefs of his people, who believed not, and who denied the meeting of the life to come, and on whom We had bestowed affluence in this present life, said, this is not other than a man, as ye are; he eateth of that whereof ye eat, and he drinketh of that whereof ye drink
And if ye obey a man like unto your selves, ye will surely be sufferers
Doth he threaten you that after ye shall be dead, and shall become dust and bones, ye shall be brought forth alive from your graves
Away, away with that ye are threatened with
There is no other life besides our present life: We die, and we live; and we shall not be raised again
This is no other than a man, who deviseth a lie concerning God: But we will not believe him
Their apostle said, O Lord, defend me; for that they have accused me of imposture
God answered, after a little while they shall surely repent their obstinacy
Wherefore a severe punishment was justly inflicted on them, and We rendered them like the refuse which is carried down by a stream. Away therefore with the ungodly people
Afterwards We raised up other generations after them
No nation shall be punished before their determined time; neither shall they be respited after
Afterwards We sent our apostles, one after another. So often as their apostle came unto any nation, they charged him with imposture: And We caused them successively to follow one another to destruction; and We made them only subjects of traditional stories. Away therefore with the unbelieving nations
Afterwards We sent Moses, and Aaron his brother, with our signs and manifest power
unto Pharaoh and his princes: But they proudly refused to believe on him; for they were a haughty people
And they said, shall we believe on two men like unto our selves; whose people are our servants
And they accused them of imposture: Wherefore they became of the number of those who were destroyed
And We heretofore gave the book of the law unto Moses, that the children of Israel might be directed thereby
And We appointed the son of Mary, and his mother, for a sign: And We prepared an abode for them in an elevated part of the earth, being a place of quiet and security, and watered with running springs
O apostles eat of those things which are good; and work righteousness: for I well know that which ye do
This your religion is one religion; and I am your Lord: Wherefore fear Me
But men have rent the affair of their religion into various sects: Every party rejoiceth in that which they follow
Wherefore leave them in their confusion, until a certain time
Do they think that We hasten unto them the wealth and children, which We have abundantly bestowed on them
for their good? But they do not understand
Verily they who stand in awe, for fear of their Lord
and who believe in the signs of their Lord
and who attribute not companions unto their Lord
and who give that which they give in alms, their hearts being struck with dread, for that they must return unto their Lord
These hasten unto good, and are foremost to obtain the same
We will not impose any difficulty on a soul, except according to its ability; with us is a book, which speaketh the truth; and they shall not be injured
But their hearts are drowned in negligence, as to this matter; and they have works different from those We have mentioned; which they will continue to do, until
when We chastise such of them as enjoy an affluence of fortune, by a severe punishment, behold, they cry aloud for help
But it shall be answered them, cry not for help to day: For ye shall not be assisted by Us
My signs were read unto you, but ye turned back on your heels
Proudly elating your selves because of your possessing the holy temple; discoursing together by night, and talking foolishly
Do they not therefore attentively consider that which is spoken unto them; whether a revelation is come unto them which came not unto their forefathers
Or do they not know their apostle; and therefore reject him
Or do they say, he is a madman? Nay, he hath come unto them with the truth; but the greater part of them detest the truth
If the truth had followed their desires, verily the heavens and the earth, and whoever therein is, had been corrupted. But We have brought them their admonition; and they turn aside from their admonition
Dost thou ask of them any maintenance for thy preaching? Since the maintenance of thy Lord is better; for He is the most bounteous provider
Thou certainly invitest them to the right way
And they who believe not in the life to come, do surely deviate from that way
If we had had compassion on them, and had taken off from them the calamity which had befallen them, they would surely have more obstinately persisted in their error, wandering in confusion
We formerly chastised them with a punishment: Yet they did not humble themselves before their Lord, neither did they make supplications unto Him
until, when We have opened upon them a door, from which a severe punishment hath issued, behold, they are driven to despair thereat
It is God who hath created in you the senses of hearing and of sight, that ye may perceive our judgments, and hearts, that ye may seriously consider them: Yet how few of you give thanks
It is He who hath produced you in the earth; and before Him shall ye be assembled
It is He who giveth life, and putteth to death; and to Him is to be attributed the vicissitude of night and day: Do ye not therefore understand
But the unbelieving Meccans say as their predecessors said
They say, when we shall be dead, and shall have become dust and bones, shall we really be raised to life
We have already been threatened with this, and our fathers also heretofore: This is nothing but fables of the ancients
Say, whose is the earth, and whoever therein is; if ye know
They will answer, God's. Say, will ye not therefore consider
Say, who is the Lord, of the seven heavens, and the Lord of the magnificent throne
They will answer, they are God's. Say, will ye not therefore fear Him
Say, in whose hand is the kingdom of all things; who protecteth whom He pleaseth, but is himself protected of none; if ye know
They will answer, in God's. Say, how therefore are ye bewitched
Yea, we have brought them the truth; and they are certainly liars in denying the same
God hath not begotten issue; neither is there any other god with Him: Otherwise every god had surely taken away that which He had created; and some of them had exalted themselves above the others. Far be that from God, which they affirm of Him
He knoweth that which is concealed, and that which is made public: Wherefore far be it from Him to have those sharers in his honour, which they attribute to Him
Say, O Lord, if thou wilt surely cause me to see the vengeance with which they have been threatened
O Lord, set me not among the ungodly people
For We are surely able to make thee to see that with which We have threatened them
Turn aside evil with that which is better: We well know the calumnies which they utter against thee
And say, O Lord, I fly unto thee for refuge, against the suggestions of the devils
And I have recourse unto Thee, O Lord, to drive them away, that they be not present with me
The gainsaying of the unbelievers ceaseth not until, when death overtaketh any of them, he saith, O Lord, suffer me to return to life
that I may do that which is right; in professing the true faith which I have neglected. By no means. Verily these are the words which he shall speak: But behind them there shall be a bar, until the day of resurrection
When therefore the trumpet shall be sounded, there shall be no relation between them which shall be regarded on that day; neither shall they ask assistance of each other
They whose balances shall be heavy with good works shall be happy
but they whose balances shall be light are those who shall lose their souls, and shall remain in hell for ever
The fire shall scorch their faces, and they shall writhe their mouths therein for anguish
and it shall be said unto them, Were not my signs rehearsed unto you; and did ye not charge them with falsehood
They shall answer, O LORD, our unhappiness prevailed over us, and we were people who sent astray
O LORD, take us forth from this fire: if we return to our former wickedness, we shall surely be unjust
God will say unto them, Be ye driven away with ignominy thereinto: and speak not unto me to deliver you
Verily there were a party of my servants, who said, O LORD, we believe: wherefore forgive us, and be merciful unto us; for thou art the best of those who show mercy
But ye received them with scoffs, so that they suffered you to forget my admonition, and ye laughed them to scorn
I have this day rewarded them, for that they suffered the injuries ye offered them with patience: verily they enjoy great felicity
God will say, What number of years have ye continued on earth
They will answer, We have continued there a day, or part of a day: but ask those who keep account
God will say, Ye have tarried but a while, if ye knew it
Did ye think that we had created you in sport, and that ye should not be brought again before us
Wherefore let GOD be exalted, the King, the Truth! There is no GOD besides him, the LORD of the honourable throne
Whoever together with the true GOD shall invoke another god, concerning whom he hath no demonstrative proof, shall surely be brought to an account for the same before his LORD. Verily the infidels shall not prosper
Say, O LORD, pardon, and show mercy; for thou art the best of those who show mercy
This sura have We sent down from heaven; and have ratified the same: And We have revealed therein evident signs, that ye may be warned
The whore, and the whoremonger, shall ye scourge with an hundred stripes. And let not compassion towards them prevent you from executing the judgment of God; if ye believe in God and the last day: And let some of the true believers be witnesses of their punishment
The whoremonger shall not marry any other than a harlot, or an idolatress. And a harlot shall no man take in marriage, except a whoremonger, or an idolater. And this kind of marriage is forbidden the true believers
But as to those who accuse women of reputation of whoredom, and produce not four witnesses of the fact, scourge them with fourscore stripes, and receive not their testimony for ever; for such are infamous prevaricators
Excepting those who shall afterwards repent, and amend; for unto such will God be gracious and merciful
They who shall accuse their wives of adultery, and shall have no witnesses thereof besides themselves; the testimony which shall be required of one of them shall be, that he swear four times by God that he speaketh the truth
And the fifth time that he imprecate the curse of God on him, if he be a liar
And it shall avert the punishment from the wife, if she swear four times by God that he is a liar
and if the fifth time she imprecate the wrath of God on her, if he speaketh the truth
If it were not for the indulgence of God towards you, and his mercy, and that God is easy to be reconciled, and wise; He would immediately discover your crimes
As to the party among you who have published the falsehood concerning Ayesha, think it not to be an evil unto you: On the contrary, it is better for you. Every man of them shall be punished according to the injustice of which he hath been guilty; and he among them who hath undertaken to aggravate the same, shall suffer a grievous punishment
Did not the faithful men, and the faithful women, when ye heard this, judge in their own minds for the best; and say, this is a manifest falsehood
Have they produced four witnesses thereof? Wherefore since they have not produced the witnesses, they are surely liars in the sight of God
Had it not been for the indulgence of God towards you, and his mercy, in this world and in that which is to come, verily a grievous punishment had been inflicted on you, for the calumny which ye have spread
When ye published that with your tongues, and spoke that with your mouths, of which ye had no knowledge; and esteemed it to be light, whereas it was a matter of importance in the sight of God
When ye heard it, did ye say, it belongeth not unto us, that we should talk of this matter: God forbid! This is a grievous calumny
God warneth you, that ye return not to the like crime for ever; if ye be true believers
And God declareth unto you his signs; for God is knowing and wise
Verily they who love that scandal be published of those who believe, shall receive a severe punishment both in this world, and in the next. God knoweth, but ye know not
Had it not been for the indulgence of God towards you, and his mercy, and that God is gracious and merciful, ye had felt his vengeance
O true believers, follow not the steps of the devil: For whosoever shall follow the steps of the devil, he will command him filthy crimes, and that which is unlawful. If it were not for the indulgence of God, and his mercy towards you, there had not been so much as one of you cleansed from his guilt for ever: But God cleanseth whom he pleaseth; for God both heareth and knoweth
Let not those among you who possess abundance of wealth, and have ability, swear that they will not give unto their kindred, and the poor, and those who have fled their country for the sake of God's true religion: But let them forgive, and act with benevolence towards them. Do ye not desire that God should pardon you? And God is gracious and merciful
Moreover they who falsely accuse modest women, who behave in a negligent manner, and are true believers, shall be cursed in this world, and in the world to come; and they shall suffer a severe punishment
One day their own tongues shall bear witness against them, and their hands, and their feet, concerning that which they have done
On that day shall God render unto them their just due; and they shall know that God is the evident truth
The wicked women should be joined to the wicked men, and the wicked men to the wicked women; but the good women should be married to the good men, and the good men to the good women. These shall be cleared from the calumnies which slanderers speak of them: They shall obtain pardon, and an honourable provision
O true believers, enter not any houses, besides your own houses, until ye have asked leave, and have saluted the family thereof: This is better for you; peradventure ye will be admonished
And if ye shall find no person in the houses, yet do not enter them, until leave be granted you: And if it be said unto you, return back; do ye return back. This will be more decent for you; and God knoweth that which ye do
It shall be no crime in you, that ye enter uninhabited houses, wherein ye may meet with a convenience. God knoweth that which ye discover, and that which ye conceal
Speak unto the true believers, that they restrain their eyes, and keep themselves from immodest actions: This will be more pure for them; for God is well acquainted with that which they do
And speak unto the believing women, that they restrain their eyes, and preserve their modesty, and discover not their ornaments, except what necessarily appeareth thereof: And let them throw their veils over their bosoms, and not shew their ornaments, unless to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands fathers, or their sons, or their husbands sons, or their brothers, or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their women, or the captives which their right-hands shall possess, or unto such men as attend them, and have no need of women, or unto children, who distinguish not the nakedness of women. And let them not make a noise with their feet, that their ornaments which they hide may thereby be discovered. And be ye all turned unto God, O true believers, that ye may be happy
Marry those who are single among you, and such as are honest of your men-servants, and your maid-servants: If they be poor, God will enrich them of his abundance; for God is bounteous and wise
And let those who find not a match, keep themselves from fornication, until God shall enrich them of his abundance. And unto such of your slaves as desire a written instrument allowing them to redeem themselves on paying a certain sum, write one, if ye know good in them; and give them of the riches of God, which He hath given you. And compel not your maid-servants to prostitute themselves, if they be willing to live chastly; that ye may seek the casual advantage of this present life: But whoever shall compel them thereto, verily God will be gracious and merciful unto such women after their compulsion
And now have We revealed unto you evident signs, and a history like unto some of the histories of those who have gone before you, and an admonition unto the pious
God is the light of heaven and earth: The similitude of his light is as a niche in a wall, wherein a lamp is placed, and the lamp inclosed in a case of glass; the glass appears as it were a shining star. It is lighted with the oil of a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east, nor of the west: It wanteth little but that the oil thereof would give light, although no fire touched it. This is light added unto light: God will direct unto his light whom He pleaseth. God propoundeth parables unto men; for God knoweth all things
In the houses which God hath permitted to be raised, and that his name be commemorated therein: Men celebrate his praise in the same morning and evening
whom neither merchandizing, nor selling diverteth from the remembering of God, and the observance of prayer, and the giving of alms; fearing the day whereon men's hearts and eyes shall be troubled
that God may recompense them according to the utmost merit of what they shall have wrought, and may add unto them of his abundance a more excellent reward; for God bestoweth on whom he pleaseth without measure
But as to the unbelievers, their works are like the vapour in a plain, which the thirsty traveller thinketh to be water, until, when he cometh thereto, he findeth it to be nothing; but he findeth God with him, and he will fully pay him his account; and God is swift in taking an account
Or, as the darkness in a deep sea, covered by waves riding on waves, above which are clouds, being additions of darkness one over the other; when one stretcheth forth his hand, he is far from seeing it. And unto whomsoever God shall not grant his light, he shall enjoy no light at all
Dost thou not perceive that all creatures both in heaven and earth praise God; and the birds also, extending their wings? Every one knoweth his prayer, and his praise: And God knoweth that which they do
Unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth; and unto God shall be the return at the last day
Dost thou not see that God gently driveth forward the clouds, and gathereth them together, and then layeth them on heaps? Thou also seest the rain, which falleth from the midst thereof; and God sendeth down from heaven as it were mountains, wherein there is hail; He striketh therewith whom He pleaseth, and turneth the same away from whom He pleaseth: The brightness of his lightning wanteth but little of taking away the sight
God shifteth the night, and the day: Verily herein is an instruction unto those who have sight
And God hath created every animal of water; one of them goeth on his belly, and another of them walketh upon two feet, and another of them walketh upon four feet: God createth that which he pleaseth; for God is almighty
Now have We sent down evident signs: And God directeth whom He pleaseth into the right way
The hypocrites say, we believe in God, and on his apostle; and we obey them: Yet a part of them turneth back, after this; but these are not really believers
And when they are summoned before God and his apostle, that He may judge between them; behold, a part of them retire
But if the right had been on their side, they would have come and submitted themselves unto Him
Is there an infirmity in their hearts? Do they doubt? Or do they fear lest God and his apostle act unjustly towards them? But themselves are the unjust doers
The saying of the true believers, when they are summoned before God and his apostle, that He may judge between them, is no other than that they say, we have heard, and do obey: And these are they who shall prosper
Whoever shall obey God and his apostle, and shall fear God, and shall be devout towards Him; these shall enjoy great felicity
They swear by God, with a most solemn oath, that if thou commandest them, they will go forth from their houses and possessions. Say, swear not to a falsehood: Obedience is more requisite: And God is well acquainted with that which ye do
Say, obey God, and obey the apostle: But if ye turn back, verily it is expected of him that he perform his duty, and of you that ye perform your duty; and if ye obey him, ye shall be directed: But the duty of our apostle is only public preaching
God promiseth unto such of you as believe, and do good works, that he will cause them to succeed the unbelievers in the earth, as he caused those who were before you to succeed the infidels of their time; and that he will establish for them their religion which pleaseth them, and will change their fear into security. They shall worship Me; and shall not associate any other with Me. But whoever shall disbelieve after this; they will be the wicked doers
Observe prayer, and give alms, and obey the apostle; that ye may obtain mercy
Think not that the unbelievers shall frustrate the designs of God on earth: And their abode hereafter shall be hell fire; a miserable journey shall it be thither
O true believers, let your slaves and those among you who shall not have attained the age of puberty, ask leave of you, before they come into your presence, three times in the day; namely, before the morning prayer, and when ye lay aside your garments at noon, and after the evening prayer. These are the three times for you to be private: It shall be no crime in you, or in them, if they go into you without asking permission after these times, while ye are in frequent attendance, the one of you on the other. Thus God declareth his signs unto you; for God is knowing and wise
And when your children attain the age of puberty, let them ask leave to come into your presence at all times, in the same manner as those who have attained that age before them, ask leave. Thus God declareth his signs unto you; and God is knowing and wise
As to such women as are past child-bearing, who hope not to marry again, because of their advanced age; it shall be no crime in them, if they lay aside their outer garments, not shewing their ornaments; but if they abstain from this, it will be better for them. God both heareth and knoweth
It shall be no crime in the blind, nor shall it be any crime in the lame, neither shall it be any crime in the sick, or in your selves, that ye eat in your houses, or in the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or in the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your uncles on the father's side, or the houses of your aunts on the father's side, or the houses of your uncles on the mother's side, or the houses of your aunts on the mother's side, or in those houses the keys whereof ye have in your possession, or in the house of your friend. It shall not be any crime in you whether ye eat together, or separately. And when ye enter any houses, salute one another on the part of God, with a blessed and a welcome salutation. Thus God declareth his signs unto you, that ye may understand
Verily they only are true believers, who believe in God and his apostle, and when they are assembled with him on any affair, depart not, until they have obtained leave of him. Verily they who ask leave of thee, are those who believe in God and his apostle. When therefore they ask leave of thee to depart, on account of any business of their own, grant leave unto such of them as thou shalt think fit, and ask pardon for them of God; for God is gracious and merciful
Let not the calling of the apostle be esteemed among you, as your calling the one to the other. God knoweth such of you as privately withdraw themselves from the assembly, taking shelter behind one another. But let those who withstand his command, take heed; lest some calamity befall them in this world, or a grievous punishment be inflicted on them in the life to come
Doth not whatever is in heaven and on earth belong unto God? He well knoweth what ye are about: And on a certain day they shall be assembled before Him; and He shall declare unto them that which they have done; for God knoweth all things
Blessed be he who hath revealed the Forkan unto his servant, that he may be a preacher unto all creatures
Unto whom belongeth the kingdom of heaven and of earth: Who hath begotten no issue; and hath no partner in his kingdom: Who hath created all things; and disposed the same according to his determinate will
Yet have they taken other gods besides Him; which have created nothing, but are themselves created: And are able neither to avert evil from, nor to procure good unto themselves; and have not the power of death, or of life, or of raising the dead
And the unbelievers say, this Koran is no other than a forgery which he hath contrived; and other people have assisted him therein: But they utter an unjust thing, and a falsehood
They also say, these are fables of the ancients, which he hath caused to be written down; and they are dictated unto him morning and evening
Say, He hath revealed it, who knoweth the secrets in heaven and earth: Verily He is gracious and merciful
And they say, what kind of apostle is this? He eateth food, and walketh in the streets, as we do: Unless an angel be sent down unto him, and become a fellow preacher with him
or unless a treasure be cast down unto him; or he have a garden, of the fruit whereof he may eat; we will not believe. The ungodly also say, ye follow no other than a man who is distracted
Behold, what they liken thee unto. But they are deceived; neither can they find a just occasion to reproach thee
Blessed be He, who, if He pleaseth, will make for thee a better provision than this which they speak of, namely, gardens through which rivers flow: And He will provide thee palaces

But it shall be answered them, call not this day for one death, but call for many deaths
Say, is this better, or a garden of eternal duration, which is promised unto the pious? It shall be given unto them for a reward, and a retreat
Therein shall they have whatever they please; continuing in the same for ever. This is a promise to be demanded at the hands of thy Lord
On a certain day He shall assemble them, and whatever they worship, besides God; and shall say unto the worshipped, Did ye seduce these my servants; or did they wander of themselves from the right way
They shall answer, God forbid! It was not fitting for us, that we should take any protectors besides Thee: But Thou didst permit them and their fathers to enjoy abundance; so that they forgot thy admonition, and became lost people
And God shall say unto their worshippers, now have these convinced you of falsehood, in that which ye say: They can neither avert your punishment, nor give you any assistance. And whoever of you shall be guilty of injustice, him will We cause to taste a grievous torment
We have sent no messengers before thee, but they ate food, and walked through the streets: And We make some of you an occasion of trial unto others. Will ye persevere with patience? since your Lord regardeth your perseverance
They who hope not to meet Us at the resurrection say, unless the angels be sent down unto us, or we see our Lord Himself, we will not believe. Verily they behave themselves arrogantly; and have transgressed with an enormous transgression
The day whereon they shall see the angels, there shall be no glad tidings on that day for the wicked; and they shall say, be this removed far from us
And We will come unto the work which they shall have wrought, and We will make it as dust scattered abroad
On that day shall they who are destined to paradise be more happy in an abode, and have a preferable place of repose at noon
On that day the heaven shall be cloven in sunder by the clouds, and the angels shall be sent down, descending visibly therein
On that day the kingdom shall of right belong wholly unto the Merciful; and that day shall be grievous for the unbelievers
On that day, the unjust person shall bite his hands for anguish and despair, and shall say, O that I had taken the way of truth with the apostle
Alas for me! O that I had not taken such a one for my friend
He seduced me from the admonition of God, after it had come unto me: For the devil is the betrayer of man
And the apostle shall say, O Lord, verily my people esteemed this Koran to be a vain composition
In like manner did We ordain unto every prophet an enemy from among the wicked: But thy Lord is a sufficient director, and defender
The unbelievers say, unless the Koran be sent down unto him entire at once, we will not believe. But in this manner have We revealed it, that We might confirm thy heart thereby, and We have dictated it gradually, by distinct parcels
They shall not come unto thee with any strange question; but We will bring thee the truth in answer, and a most excellent interpretation
They who shall be dragged on their faces into hell, shall be in the worst condition, and shall stray most widely from the way of salvation
We heretofore delivered unto Moses the book of the law; and We appointed him Aaron his brother for a counsellor
And We said unto them, go ye to the people who charge our signs with falsehood. And We destroyed them with a signal destruction
And remember the people of Noah, when they accused our apostles of imposture: We drowned them, and made them a sign unto mankind. And We have prepared for the unjust a painful torment
Remember also Ad, and Thamud, and those who dwelt at al Rass; and many other generations, within this period
Unto each of them did We propound examples for their admonition; and each of them did We destroy with an utter destruction
The Koreish have passed frequently near the city which was rained on by a fatal rain: Have they not seen where it once stood? Yet have they not dreaded the resurrection
When they see thee, they will receive thee only with scoffing, saying, is this he, whom God hath sent as his apostle
Verily he had almost drawn us aside from the worship of our gods; if we had not firmly persevered in our devotion towards them. But they shall know hereafter, when they shall see the punishment prepared for them, who hath strayed more widely from the right path
What thinkest thou? He who taketh his lust for his god; canst thou be his guardian
Dost thou imagine that the greater part of them hear, or understand? They are no other than like the brute cattle; yea, they stray more widely from the true path
Dost thou not consider the works of thy Lord, how He stretcheth forth the shadow before sun-rise? If he had pleased, he would have made it immovable for ever. Then We cause the sun to rise, and to shew the same
and afterwards We contract it by an easy and gradual contraction
It is He who hath ordained the night to cover you as a garment; and sleep to give you rest; and hath ordained the day for waking
It is He who sendeth the winds, driving abroad the pregnant clouds, as the forerunners of his mercy: And We send down pure water from heaven
that We may thereby revive a dead country, and give to drink thereof unto what We have created, both of cattle and men, in great numbers
and We distribute the same among them at various times, that they may consider: But the greater part of men refuse to consider, only out of ingratitude
If We had pleased, We had sent a preacher unto every city
Wherefore do not thou obey the unbelievers; but oppose them herewith, with a strong opposition
It is He who hath let loose the two seas; this fresh and sweet, and that salt and bitter: And hath placed between them a bar, and a bound which cannot be passed
It is He who hath created man of water; and hath made him to bear the double relation of consanguinity and affinity; for thy Lord is powerful
They worship, besides God, that which can neither profit them nor hurt them: And the unbeliever is an assistant of the devil against his Lord
We have sent thee to be no other than a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats
Say, I ask not of you any reward for this my preaching; besides the conversion of him who shall desire to take the way unto his Lord
And do thou trust in Him who liveth, and dieth not; and celebrate his praise: -- He is sufficiently acquainted with the faults of his servants
Who hath created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, in six days; and then ascended his throne; the Merciful. Ask now the knowing concerning Him
When it is said unto the unbelievers, adore the Merciful; they reply, and who is the Merciful? Shall we adore that which thou commandest us? And this precept causeth them to fly the faster from the faith
Blessed be He who hath placed the twelve signs in the heavens; and hath placed therein a lamp by day, and the moon which shineth by night
It is He who hath ordained the night and the day to succeed each other, for the observation of him who will consider, or desireth to shew his gratitude
The servants of the Merciful are those who walk meekly on the earth, and, when the ignorant speak unto them, answer, peace
And who pass the night adoring their Lord, and standing up to pray unto Him
and who say, O Lord, avert from us the torment of hell, for the torment thereof is perpetual
verily the same is a miserable abode, and a wretched station
And who, when they bestow, are neither profuse, nor niggardly; but observe a just medium between these
and who invoke not another god together with the true God; neither slay the soul, which God hath forbidden to be slain, unless for a just cause
And who are not guilty of fornication. His punishment shall be doubled unto him on the day of resurrection; and he shall remain therein, covered with ignominy, for ever
Except him who shall repent, and believe, and shall work a righteous work; unto them will God change their former evils into good; for God is ready to forgive, and merciful
And whoever repenteth, and doth that which is right; verily he turneth unto God with an acceptable conversion
And they who do not bear false witness; and when they pass by vain discourse, pass by the same with decency
And who, when they are admonished by the signs of their Lord, fall not down as if they were deaf and blind, but stand up and are attentive thereto
And who say, O Lord, grant us of our wives and our offspring such as may be the satisfaction of our eyes; and make us patterns unto those who fear thee
These shall be rewarded with the highest apartments in paradise, because they have persevered with constancy; and they shall meet therein with greeting and salutation
they shall remain in the same for ever: It shall be an excellent abode, and a delightful station
Say, my Lord is not solicitous on your account, if ye do not invoke Him: Ye have already charged his apostle with imposture; but hereafter shall there be a lasting punishment inflicted on you
M
These are the signs of the perspicuous book

and they have charged it with falsehood: But a message shall come unto them, which they shall not laugh to scorn
Do they not behold the earth, how many vegetables We cause to spring up therein, of every noble species
Verily herein is a sign: But the greater part of them do not believe
Verily thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful God
Remember when thy Lord called Moses, saying, go to the unjust people
the people of Pharaoh; will they not dread Me
Moses answered, O Lord, verily I fear lest they accuse me of falsehood
and lest my breast become straitened, and my tongue be not ready in speaking: Send therefore unto Aaron, to be my assistant
Also they have a crime to object against me; and I fear they will put me to death
God said, they shall by no means put thee to death: Wherefore go ye with our signs; for We will be with you, and will hear what passes between you and them
Go ye therefore unto Pharaoh, and say, verily we are the apostle of the Lord of all creatures
Send away with us the children of Israel
And when they had delivered their message, Pharaoh answered, have we not brought thee up among us, when a child; and hast thou not dwelt among us for several years of thy life
Yet hast thou done thy deed which thou hast done: And thou art an ungrateful person
Moses replied, I did it indeed, and I was one of those who erred
wherefore I fled from you, because I feared you: But my Lord hath bestowed on me wisdom, and hath appointed me one of his apostles
And this is the favour which thou hast bestowed on me, that thou hast enslaved the children of Israel
Pharaoh said, and who is the Lord of all creatures
Moses answered, the Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them: If ye are men of sagacity
Pharaoh said unto those who were about him, do ye not hear
Moses said, your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers
Pharaoh said unto those who were present, your apostle, who is sent unto you, is certainly distracted
Moses said, the Lord of the east, and of the west, and of whatever is between them; if ye are men of understanding
Pharaoh said unto him, verily if thou take any god besides me, I will make thee one of those who are imprisoned
Moses answered, what, although I come unto you with a convincing miracle
Pharaoh replied, produce it therefore, if thou speakest truth
And he cast down his rod, and behold, it became a visible serpent
And he drew forth his hand out of his bosom; and behold, it appeared, white unto the spectators
Pharahoh said unto the princes who were about him, verily this man is a skilful magician
He seeketh to dispossess you of your land by his sorcery; what therefore do ye direct
They answered, delay him, and his brother by good words for a time; and send through the cities men to assemble
and bring unto thee every skilful magician
So the magicians were assembled at an appointed time, on a solemn day
And it was said unto the people, are ye assembled together
Perhaps we may follow the magicians, if they do get the victory
And when the magicians were come, they said unto Pharaoh, shall we certainly receive a reward, if we do get the victory
He answered, yea; and ye shall surely be of those who approach my person
Moses said unto them, cast down what ye are about to cast down
Wherefore they cast down their ropes and their rods, and said, by the might of Pharaoh, verily we shall be the conquerors
And Moses cast down his rod, and behold, it swallowed up that which they had caused falsely to appear changed into serpents
Whereupon the magicians prostrated themselves, worshipping
and said, we believe in the Lord of all creatures
the Lord of Moses and of Aaron
Pharaoh said unto them, have ye believed on him, before I have given you permission? Verily he is your chief, who hath taught you magic: But hereafter ye shall surely know my power. I will cut off your hands and your feet, on the opposite sides, and I will crucify you all
They answered, it will be no harm unto us; for we shall return unto our Lord
We hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, since we are the first who have believed
And we spake by revelation unto Moses, saying, march forth with my servants by night; for ye will be pursued
And Pharaoh sent officers through the cities to assemble forces, saying
verily these are a small company
and they are enraged against us
But we are a multitude well provided
So we caused them to quit their gardens, and fountains
and treasures, and fair dwellings
Thus did We do; and We made the children of Israel to inherit the same
And they pursued them at sun-rise
And when the two armies were come in sight of each other, the companions of Moses said, we shall surely be overtaken
Moses answered, by no means: For my Lord is with me, Who will surely direct me

And We drew thither the others
and We delivered Moses and all those who were with him
Then We drowned the others
Verily herein was a sign; but the greater part of them did not believe
Verily thy Lord is the mighty, and the merciful
And rehearse unto them the story of Abraham
When he said unto his father, and his people, what do ye worship
They answered, we worship idols; and we constantly serve them all the day long
Abraham said, do they hear you, when ye invoke them
Or do they either profit you, or hurt you
They answered, but we found our fathers do the same
He said, what think ye? The gods which ye worship
and your forefathers worshipped
are my enemy: Except only the Lord of all creatures
who hath created me, and directeth me
and who giveth me to eat, and to drink
and when I am sick, healeth me
and Who will cause me to die, and will afterwards restore me to life
and Who, I hope, will forgive my sins on the day of judgment
O Lord, grant me wisdom; and join me with the righteous
And grant that I may be spoken of with honour among the latest posterity
and make me an heir of the garden of delight
And forgive my father, for that he hath been one of those who go astray
And cover me not with shame on the day of resurrection
on the day in which neither riches nor children shall avail
unless unto him who shall come unto God with a sincere heart
When paradise shall be brought near to the view of the pious
and hell shall appear plainly to those who shall have erred
and it shall be said unto them, where are your deities which ye served
besides God? Will they deliver you from punishment, or will they deliver themselves
And they shall be cast into the same, both they, and those who have been seduced to their worship
and all the host of Eblis
The seduced shall dispute therein with their false gods, saying
by God, we were in a manifest error
when we equalled you with the Lord of all creatures
And none seduced us but the wicked
We have now no intercessors
nor any friend who careth for us
If we were allowed to return once more into the world, we would certainly become true believers
Verily herein was a sign: But the greater part of them believed not
Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
The people of Noah accused God's messengers of imposture
When their brother Noah said unto them, will ye not fear God

wherefore fear God, and obey me

Wherefore fear God, and obey me
They answered, shall we believe on thee, when only the most abject persons have followed thee
Noah said, I have no knowledge of that which they did
it appertaineth unto my Lord alone to bring them to account, if ye understand
wherefore I will not drive away the believers
I am no more than a public preacher
They replied, assuredly, unless thou desist, O Noah, thou shalt be stoned
He said, O Lord, verily my people take me for a liar
Wherefore judge publicly between me and them; and deliver me and the true believers who are with me

and afterwards We drowned the rest

And do ye erect maginificent works, hoping that ye may continue in their possession for ever
And when ye exercise your power, do ye exercise it with cruelty and rigour
Fear God, by leaving these things; and obey Me
And fear Him who hath bestowed on you that which ye know
He hath bestowed on you cattle, and children
and gardens, and springs of water
Verily I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day
They answered, it is equal unto us whether thou admonish us, or dost not admonish us
This which thou preachest is only a device of the ancients
neither shall we be punished for what we have done

Verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
Wherefore fear God, and obey me

Shall ye be left for ever secure in the possession of the things which are here
among gardens, and fountains
and corn, and palm-trees, whose branches sheathe their flowers
And will ye continue to cut habitations for your selves out of the mountains, behaving with insolence
Fear God, and obey me
and obey not the command of the transgressors
who act corruptly in the earth, and reform not the same
They answered, verily thou art distracted
Thou art no other than a man like unto us: Produce now some sign, if thou speakest truth
Saleh said, this she-camel shall be a sign unto you: She shall have her portion of water, and ye shall have your portion of water alternately, on a several day appointed for you
and do her no hurt, lest the punishment of a terrible day be inflicted on you
But they slew her; and were made to repent of their impiety
For the punishment which had been threatened overtook them. Verily herein was a sign; but the greater part of them did not believe
Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
The people of Lot likewise accused God's messengers of imposture
When their brother Lot said unto them, will ye not fear God
Verily I am a faithful messenger unto you
Wherefore fear God, and obey me
I demand no reward of you for my preaching: I expect my reward from no other than the Lord of all creatures
Do ye approach unto the males among mankind
and leave your wives which your Lord hath created for you? Surely ye are people who transgress
They answered, unless thou desist, O Lot, thou shalt certainly be expelled our city
He said, verily I am one of those who abhor your doings
O Lord, deliver me, and my family, from that which they act
Wherefore We delivered him, and all his family
except an old woman, his wife, who perished among those who remained behind
Then We destroyed the rest
and We rained on them a shower of stones; and terrible was the shower which fell on those who had been warned in vain
Verily herein was a sign; but the greater part of them did not believe
Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
The inhabitants of the wood also accused God's messengers of imposture

Give just measure, and be not defrauders
and weigh with an equal balance
and diminish not unto men ought of their matters; neither commit violence in the earth, acting corruptly
And fear him who hath created you, and also the former generations
They answered, certainly thou art distracted
Thou art no more than a man, like unto us; and we do surely esteem thee to be a liar
Cause now a part of the heaven to fall upon us, if thou speakest truth
Shoaib said, my Lord best knoweth that which ye do
And they charged him with falsehood: Wherefore the punishment of the day of the shadowing cloud overtook them; and this was the punishment of a grievous day
Verily herein was a sign; but the greater part of them did not believe
Thy Lord is the mighty, the merciful
This book is certainly a revelation from the Lord of all creatures
which the faithful spirit hath caused to descend
upon thy heart, that thou mightest be a preacher to thy prople
in the perspicuous Arabic tongue
And it is born witness to in the scriptures of former ages
Was it not a sign unto them, that the wise men among the children of Israel knew it
Had We revealed it unto any of the foreigners
and he had read the same unto them, yet they would not have believed therein
Thus have We caused obstinate infidelity to enter the hearts of the wicked
They shall not believe therein, until they see a painful punishment
It shall come suddenly upon them, and they shall not foresee it
And they shall say, shall we be respited
Do they therefore desire our punishment to be hastened
What thinkest thou? If We suffer them to enjoy the advantage of this life for several years
and afterwards that with which they are threatened come upon them
what will that which they have enjoyed profit them
We have destroyed no city, but preachers were first sent unto it
to admonish the inhabitants thereof; neither did We treat them unjustly
The devils did not descend with the Koran, as the infidels give out
It is not for their purpose, neither are they able to produce such a book
for they are far removed from hearing the discourse of the angels in heaven
Invoke no other god with the true God, lest thou become one of those who are doomed to punishment
And admonish thy more near relations
And behave thy self with meekness towards the true believers who follow thee
And if they be disobedient unto thee, say, verily I am clear of that which ye do
And trust in the most mighty, the merciful God
who seeth thee when thou risest up
and thy behaviour among those who worship
for He both heareth and knoweth
Shall I declare unto you upon whom the devils descend
They descend upon every lying and wiched person
They learn what is heard; but the greater part of them are liars
And those who err follow the steps of the poets
Dost thou not see that they rove as bereft of their senses through every valley
and that they say that which they do not
Except those who believe, and do good works, and remember God frequently; and who defend themselves, after they have been unjustly treated. And they who act unjustly shall know hereafter, with what treatment they shall be treated
These are the signs of the Koran, and of the perspicuous book
A direction, and good tidings unto the true believers
who regularly perform their prayer, and give alms, and firmly believe in the life to come
As to those who believe not in the life to come, We have prepared their works for them; and they shall be struck with astonishment at their disappointment, when they shall be raised again
These are they whom an evil punishment awaiteth in this life; and in that which is to come they shall be the greatest losers
Thou hast certainly received the Koran from the presence of a wise, a knowing God
Remember when Moses said unto his family, verily I perceive fire: I will bring you tidings thereof, or I will bring you a lighted brand, that ye may be warmed
And when he was come near unto it, a voice cried unto him, saying, blessed be He who is in the fire, and whoever is about it; and praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
O Moses, verily I am God, the mighty, the wise
Cast down now thy rod. And when he saw it, that it moved, as though it had been a serpent, he retreated and fled, and returned not. And God said, O Moses, fear not; for my messengers are not disturbed with fear in my sight
Except he who shall have done amiss, and shall have afterwards substituted good in lieu of evil; for I am gracious and merciful
Moreover put thy hand into thy bosom; it shall come forth white, without hurt: This shall be one among the nine signs unto Pharaoh and his people; for they are a wicked people
And when our visible signs had come unto them, they said, this is manifest sorcery
And they denied them, although their souls certainly knew them to be from God, out of iniquity and pride: But behold what was the end of the corrupt doers
We heretofore bestowed knowledge on David and Solomon; and they said, praise be unto God, who hath made us more excellent than many of his faithful servants
And Solomon was David's heir; and he said, O men, we have been taught the speech of birds, and have had all things bestowed on us; this is manifest excellence
And his armies were gathered together unto Solomon, consisting of genii, and men, and birds; and they were led in distinct bands
until they came unto the valley of ants. And an ant, seeing the hosts approaching, said, O ants, enter ye into your habitations, lest Solomon and his army tread you under foot, and perceive it not
And Solomon smiled, laughing at her words, and said, O Lord, excite me that I may be thankful for thy favour, wherewith thou hast favoured me, and my parents; and that I may do that which is right, and well-pleasing unto thee: And introduce me, through thy mercy, into paradise, among thy servants the righteous
And he viewed the birds, and said, what is the reason that I see not the lapwing? Is she absent
Verily I will chastise her with a severe chastisement, or I will put her to death; unless she bring me a just excuse
And she tarried not long before she presented herself unto Solomon, and said, I have viewed a country which thou hast not viewed; and I come unto thee from Saba, with a certain piece of news
I found a woman to reign over them, who is provided with every thing requisite for a prince, and hath a magnificent throne
I found her and her people to worship the sun, besides God: And Satan hath prepared their works for them, and hath turned them aside from the way of truth, -- wherefore they are not rightly directed
lest they should worship God, who bringeth to light that which is hidden in heaven and earth, and knoweth whatever they conceal, and whatever they discover
God! There is no God but He; the Lord of the magnificent throne
Solomon said, we shall see whether thou hast spoken the truth, or whether thou art a liar
Go with this my letter, and cast it down unto them; then turn aside from them, and wait to know what answer they will return
And when the queen of Saba had received the letter, she said, O nobles, verily an honourable letter hath been delivered unto me
it is from Solomon, and this is the tenor thereof: In the name of the most merciful God
rise not up against me: But come, and surrender yourselves unto me
She said, O nobles, advise me in my business: I will not resolve on any thing, until ye be witnesses and approve thereof
The nobles answered, we are indued with strength, and are indued with great prowess in war; but the command appertaineth unto thee: See therefore what thou wilt command
She said, verily kings, when they enter a city by force, waste the same, and abase the most powerful of the inhabitants hereof: And so will these do with us
But I will send gifts unto them; and will wait for what farther information those who shall be sent, shall bring back
And when the queen's ambassador came unto Solomon, that prince said, will ye present me with riches? Verily that which God hath given me, is better than what he hath given you: But ye do glory in your gifts
Return unto the people of Saba. We will surely come unto them with forces, which they shall not be able to withstand; and we will drive them out from their city, humbled; and they shall become contemptible
And Solomon said, O nobles, which of you will bring unto me her throne, before they come and surrender themselves unto me
A terrible genius answered, I will bring it unto thee, before thou arise from thy place: For I am able to perform it, and may be trusted
And one with whom was the knowledge of the scriptures said, I will bring it unto thee, in the twinkling of an eye. And when Solomon saw the throne placed before him, he said, this is a favour of my Lord, that he may make trial of me, whether I will be grateful, or whether I will be ungrateful: And he who is grateful, is grateful to his own advantage, but if any shall be ungrateful, verily my Lord is self-sufficient and munificent
And Solomon said unto his servants, alter her throne, that she may not know it, to the end we may see whether she be rightly directed, or whether she be one of those who are not rightly directed
And when she was come unto Solomon, it was said unto her, is thy throne like this? She answered, as though it were the same. And we have had knowledge bestowed on us before this, and have been resigned unto God
But that which she worshipped, besides God, had turned her aside from the truth; for she was of an unbelieving people
It was said unto her, enter the palace. And when she saw it, she imagined it to be a great water; and she discovered her legs, by lifting up her robe to pass through it. Whereupon Solomon said unto her, verily this is a palace evenly floored with glass. Then said the queen, O Lord, verily I have dealt unjustly with my own soul; and I resign my self, together with Solomon, unto God, the Lord of all creatures
Also We heretofore sent unto the tribe of Thamud their brother Saleh; who said unto them, Serve ye God. And behold, they were divided into two parties, who disputed among themselves
Saleh said, O my people, why do ye hasten evil rather than good? Unless ye ask pardon of God, that ye may obtain mercy, ye are lost
They answered, we presage evil from thee, and from those who are with thee. Saleh replied, the evil which ye presage is with God: But ye are a people who are proved by a vicissitude of prosperity and adversity
And there were nine men in the city, who acted corruptly in the earth, and behaved not with integrity
And they said unto one another, swear ye reciprocally by God, that we will fall upon Saleh and his family by night: And afterwards we will say unto him who hath right to avenge his blood, we were not so much as present at the destruction of his family; and we certainly speak the truth
And they devised a plot against him: But We devised a plot against them; and they perceived it not
And see what was the issue of their plot: We utterly destroyed them and their whole people
and these their habitations remain empty, because of the injustice which they committed. Verily herein is a sign, unto people who understand
And We delivered those who believed, and feared God
And remember Lot; when he said unto his people, do ye commit a wickedness, though ye see the hainousness thereof
Do ye approach lustfully unto men, leaving the women? Ye are surely an ignorant people
But the answer of his people was no other than that they said, cast the family of Lot out of your city: For they are men who preserve themselves pure from the crimes of which ye are guilty
Wherefore We delivered him and his family, except his wife, whom We decreed to be one of those who remained behind to be destroyed
And We rained on them a shower of stones: And dreadful was the shower which fell on those who had been warned in vain
Say, praise be unto God; and peace be upon his servants whom He hath chosen! Is God more worthy, or the false gods which they associate with him
Is not He to be preferred, who hath created the heavens and the earth, and sendeth down rain for you from heaven, whereby We cause delicious groves to spring up? It is not in your power to cause the trees thereof to shoot forth. Is there any other god partner with the true God? Verily these are a people who deviate from the truth
Is not He more worthy to be adored, who hath established the earth, and hath caused rivers to flow through the midst thereof, and placed thereon immovable mountains, and set a bar between the two seas? Is there any other god equal with the true God? Yet the greater part of them know it not
Is not He more worthy who heareth the afflicted, when he calleth upon Him, and taketh off the evil which distressed him; and who hath made you the successors of your forefathers in the earth? Is there any other god who can be equalled with the true God? How few consider these things
Is not He more worthy Who directeth you in the dark paths of the land and of the sea; and Who sendeth the winds driving abroad the clouds, as the forerunners of this mercy? Is there any other god who can be equalled with the true God? Far be God from having those partners in his power, which ye associate with Him
Is not He more worthy, Who produceth a creature, and after it hath been dead restoreth it to life; and Who giveth you food from heaven and earth? Is there any other god with the true God, who doth this? Say, produce your proof thereof, if ye speak truth
Say, none either in heaven or earth knoweth that which is hidden, besides God: Neither do they understand when they shall be raised
However their knowledge attaineth some notion of the life to come: Yet they are in an uncertainty concerning the same; yea, they are blind as to the real curcumstances thereof
And the unblievers say, when we and our fathers shall have been reduced to dust, shall we be taken forth from the grave
Verily we have been threatened with this, both we and our fathers, heretofore. This is no other than fables of the ancients
Say unto them, pass through the earth, and see what hath been the end of the wicked
And be not thou grieved for them; neither be thou in any concern on account of the plots which they are contriving against thee
And they say, when will this threat be accomplished, if ye speak true
Answer, peradventure some part of that punishment, which ye desire to be hastened, may follow close behind you
Verily thy Lord is endued with indulgence towards mankind; but the greater part of them are not thankful
Verily thy Lord knoweth what their breasts conceal, and what they discover
And there is nothing hidden in heaven or on earth, but it is written in a clear book
Verily this Koran declareth unto the children of Israel most of those points concerning which they disagree
And it is certainly a direction, and a mercy unto the true believers
Thy Lord will decide the controversy between them, by his definitive sentence: And he is the mighty, the wise
Therefore put thy trust in God; for thou art in the manifest truth
Verily thou shalt not make the dead to hear, neither shalt thou make the deaf to hear thy call to the true faith, when they retire and turn their backs
Neither shalt thou direct the blind to extricate themselves out of their error. Thou shalt make none to hear thee, except him who shall believe in our signs: And they are wholly resigned unto Us
When the sentence shall be ready to fall upon them, We will cause a beast to come forth unto them from out of the earth, which shall speak unto them: Verily men do not firmly believe in our signs
On the day of resurrection We will assemble, out of every nation, a company of those who shall have charged our signs with falsehood; and they shall be prevented from mixing together
until they shall arrive at the place of judgment. And God shall say unto them, have ye charged my signs with falsehood, although ye comprehended them not with your knowledge? Or what is it that ye were doing
And the sentence of damnation shall fall on them, for that they have acted unjustly: And they shall not speak in their own excuse
Do they not see that We have ordained the night, that they may rest therein, and the day giving open light? Verily herein are signs unto people who believe
On that day the trumpet shall be sounded; and whoever are in heaven and on earth shall be struck with terror, except those whom God shall please to exempt therefrom: And all shall come before him, in humble guise
And thou shalt see the mountains, and shalt think them firmly fixed; but they shall pass away, even as the clouds pass away. This will be the work of God, who hath rightly disposed all things: And He is well acquainted with that which ye do
Whoever shall have wrought righteousness, shall receive a reward beyond the desert thereof; and they shall be secure from the terror of that day
But whoever shall have wrought evil, shall be thrown on their faces into hell fire. Shall ye receive the reward of any other than of that which ye shall have wrought
Verily I am commanded to worship the Lord of this territory of Mecca, Who hath sanctified the same: Unto Him belong all things. And I am commanded to be a Moslem
and to rehearse the Koran: He who shall be directed thereby, will be directed to his own advantage; and to him who shall go astray, say, verily I am a warner only
And say, praise be unto God! He will shew you his signs, and ye shall know them: And thy Lord is not regardless of that which they do
M
These are the signs of the perspicuous book
We will dictate unto thee, O Mohammed, some parts of the history of Moses and Pharaoh, with truth; for the sake of people who believe
Now Pharaoh lifted himself up in the land of Egypt; and he caused his subjects to be divided into parties: He weakened one party of them, by slaying their male-children, and preserving their females alive; for he was an oppressor
And We were minded to be gracious unto those who were weakened in the land, and to make them models of religion; and to make them the heirs of the wealth of Pharaoh and his people
and to establish a place for them in the earth; and to shew Pharaoh, and Haman, and their forces, that destruction of their kingdom and nation by them, which they sought to avoid
And We directed the mother of Moses by revelation, saying, give him suck: And if thou fearest for him, cast him into the river; and fear not, neither be afflicted; for We will restore him unto thee, and will appoint him one of our apostles
And when she had put the child in the ark, and had cast it into the river, the family of Pharaoh took him up; providence designing that he should become an enemy, and a sorrow unto them. Verily Pharaoh, and Haman, and their forces were sinners
And the wife of Pharaoh said, this child is a delight of the eye to me, and to thee: Kill him not; peradventure it may happen that he may be serviceable unto us; or we may adopt him for our son. And they perceived not the consequence of what they were doing
And the heart of the mother of Moses became oppressed with fear; and she had almost discovered him, had We not armed her heart with constancy, that she might be one of those who believe the promises of God
And she said unto his sister, follow him. And she watched him at a distance; and they perceived it not
And We suffered him not to take the breasts of the nurses who were provided before his sister came up: And she said, shall I direct you unto some of his nation, who may nurse him for you, and will be careful of him
And, at their desire, she brought his mother to them. So We restored him to his mother, that her mind might be set at ease, and that she might not be afflicted; and that she might know that the promise of God was true: But the greater part of mankind know not the truth
And when Moses had attained his age of full strength, and was become a perfect man, We bestowed on him wisdom and knowledge: And thus do We reward the upright
And he went into the city, at a time when the inhabitants thereof observed not what passed in the streets: And he found therein two men fighting; the one being of his own party, and the other of his enemies. And he who was of his party, begged his assistance against him who was of the contrary party; and Moses struck him with his fist, and slew him: But being sorry for what had happened, he said, this is of the work of the devil; for he is a seducing and an open enemy
And he said, O Lord, verily I have injured my own soul: Wherefore forgive me. So God forgave him; for He is ready to forgive, and merciful
He said, O Lord, by the favours with which thou hast favoured me, I will not be an assistant to the wicked for the future
And the next morning he was afraid in the city, and looked about him, as one apprehensive of danger: And behold, he whom he had assisted the day before, cried out unto him for help a secong time. But Moses said unto him, thou art plainly a quarrelsome fellow
And when he sought to lay hold on him who was an enemy unto them both, he said, O Moses, dost thou intend to kill me, as thou killedst a man yesterday? Thou seekest only to be an oppressor in the earth, and seekest not to be a reconciler of quarrels
And a certain man came from the farther part of the city, running hastily, and said, O Moses, verily the magistrates are deliberating concerning thee, to put thee to death: Depart therefore; I certainly advise thee well
Wherefore he departed out of the city in great fear, looking this way and that, lest he should be pursued. And he said, O Lord, deliver me from the unjust people
And when he was journeying towards Madian, he said, peradventure my Lord will direct me in the right way
And when he arrived at the water of Madian, he found about the well a company of men, who were watering their flocks. And he found, besides them, two women, who kept off their sheep at a distance. And he said unto them, what is the matter with you? They answered, we shall not water our flock, until the shepherds shall have driven away theirs; for our father is an old man, stricken in years
So Moses watered their sheep for them; and afterwards retired to the shade, saying, O Lord, verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down unto me
And one of the damsels came unto him, walking bashfully, and said, my father calleth thee, that he may recompence thee for the trouble which thou hast taken in watering our sheep for us. And when he was come unto Shoaib, and had told him the story of his adventures, he said unto him, fear not; thou hast escaped from unjust people
And one of the damsels said, my father, hire him for certain wages: The best servant thou canst hire, is an able and trusty person
And Shoaib said unto Moses, verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight years: And if thou fulfill ten years, it is in thine own breast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee: And thou shalt find me, if God please, a man of probity
Moses answered, let this be the covenant between me and thee: Whichsoever of the two terms I shall fulfil, let it be no crime in me if I then quit thy service; and God is witness of that which we say
And when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was journeying with his family towards Egypt, he saw fire on the side of mount Sinai. And he said unto his family, tarry ye here; for I see fire: Peradventure I may bring you thence some tidings of the way, or at least a brand out of the fire, that ye may be warmed
And when he was come thereto, a voice cried unto him from the right side of the valley, in the sacred bottom, from the tree, saying, O Moses, verily I am God, the Lord of all creatures
Cast down now thy rod. And when he saw it that it moved, as though it had been a serpent, he retreated and fled, and returned not. And God said unto him, O Moses, draw near, and fear not; for thou art safe
Put thy hand into thy bosom, and it shall come forth white, without any hurt: And draw back thy hand unto thee which thou stretchest forth for fear. These shall be two evident signs from thy Lord, unto Pharaoh and his princes; for they are a wicked people
Moses said, O Lord, verily I have slain one of them; and I fear they will put me to death
But my brother Aaron is of a more eloquent tongue than I am; wherefore send him with me for an assistant, that he may gain me credit; for I fear lest they accuse me of imposture
God said, We will strengthen thine arm by thy brother, and We will give each of you extraordinary power, so that they shall not come up to you, in our signs. Ye two, and whoever shall follow you, shall be the conquerors
And when Moses came unto them with our evident signs, they said, this is no other than a deceitful piece of sorcery: Neither have we heard of any thing like this among our fore-fathers
And Moses said, My Lord best knoweth who cometh with a direction from Him; and who shall have success in this life, as well as the next: But the unjust shall not prosper
And Pharaoh said, O princes, I did not know that ye had any other god besides me. Wherefore do thou, O Haman, burn me clay into bricks; and build me a high tower, that I may ascend unto the God of Moses: For I verily believe him to be a liar
And both he and his forces behaved themselves insolently and unjustly in the earth; and imagined that they should not be brought before Us to be judged
Wherefore We took him and his forces, and cast them into the sea. Behold, therefore, what was the end of the unjust
And We made them deceitful guides, inviting their followers to hell fire; and on the day of resurrection they shall not be screened from punishment
We pursued them with a curse in this life; and on the day of resurrection they shall be shamefully rejected
And We gave the book of the law unto Moses, after We had destroyed the former generations, to enlighten the minds of men, and for a direction, and a mercy; that peradventure they might consider
Thou, O prophet, wast not on the west side of mount Sinai, when We delivered Moses his commission: Neither wast thou one of those who were present at his receiving it
But we raised up several generations after Moses; and life was prolonged unto them. Neither didst thou dwell among the inhabitants of Madian, rehearsing unto them our signs; but We have sent thee fully instructed in every particular
Nor wast thou present on the side of the mount, when We called unto Moses: But thou art sent as a mercy from they Lord; that thou mightest preach unto a people to whom no preacher hath come before thee, that peradventure they may be warned
and lest, if a calamity had befallen them, for that which their hands had previously committed, they should have said, O Lord, since thou hast not sent an apostle unto us, that we might follow thy signs, and become true believers, are we not excusable
Yet when the truth is come unto them from before us, they say, unless he receive the same power to work miracles as Moses received, we will not believe. Have they not likewise rejected the revelation which was heretofore given unto Moses? They say, two cunning impostures have mutually assisted one another: And they say, verily we reject them both
Say, produce therefore a book from God, which is more right than these two, that I may follow it; if ye speak truth
But if they return thee no answer, know that they only follow their own desires: And who erreth more widely from the truth than he who followeth his own desire, without a direction from God? Verily God directeth not the unjust people
And now have We caused our word to come unto them, that they may be admonished
They unto whom We have given the scriptures which were revealed before it, believe in the same
and when it is read unto them, say, we believe therein; it is certainly the truth from our Lord: Verily we were Moslems before this
These shall receive their reward twice, because they have persevered, and repel evil by good, and distribute alms out of that which We have bestowed on them
and when they hear vain discourse, avoid the same, saying, we have our works, and ye have your works: Peace be on you; we covet not the acquaintance of the ignorant
Verily thou canst not direct whom thou wilt: But God directeth whom He pleaseth, and He best knoweth those who will submit to be directed
The Meccans say, if we follow the same direction with thee, we shall be forcibly expelled our land. Have We not established for them a secure asylum; to which fruits of every sort are brought, as a provision of our bounty? But the greater part of them do not understand
How many cities have We destroyed, whose inhabitants lived in ease and plenty? And these their dwellings are not inhabited after them, unless for a little while; and We were the inheritors of their wealth
But thy Lord did not destroy those cities, until He had sent unto their capital an apostle, to rehearse our signs unto them: Neither did We destroy those cities, unless their inhabitants were injurious to their apostle
The things which are given you, are the provisions of this present life, and the pomp thereof; but that which is with God, is better and more durable: Will ye not therefore understand
Shall he then, unto whom We have promised an excellent promise of future happiness, and who shall attain the same, be as he on whom we have bestowed the provision of this present life, and who, on the day of resurrection, shall be one of those who are delivered up to eternal punishment
On that day God shall call unto them, and shall say, where are my partners, which ye imagined to be so
And they upon whom the sentence of damnation shall be justly pronounced, shall answer, these, O Lord, are those whom we seduced; we seduced them as we also had been seduced: But now we clearly quit them, and turn unto Thee. They did not worship Us, but their own lusts
And it shall be said unto the idolaters, call now upon those whom ye associated with God: And they shall call upon them, but they shall not answer them; and they shall see the punishment prepared for them, and shall wish that they had submitted to be directed
On that day God shall call unto them, and shall say, what answer did ye return to our messengers
But they shall not be able to give an account thereof on that day; neither shall they ask one another for information
Howbeit whoso shall repent and believe, and shall do that which is right, may expect to be happy
Thy Lord createth what He pleaseth; and chooseth freely: But they have no free choice. Praise be unto God; and far be He removed from the idols which they associate with Him
Thy Lord knoweth both the secret malice which their breasts conceal, and the open hatred which they discover
He is God; there is no God but He. Unto Him is the praise due, both in this life and in that which is to come: Unto Him doth judgment belong; and before Him shall ye be assembled at the last day
Say, what think ye? If God should cover you with perpetual night, until the day of resurrection; what god, besides God, would bring you light? Will ye not therefore hearken
Say, what think ye? If God should give you continual day, until the day of resurrection; what god, besides God, would bring you night, that ye might rest therein? Will ye not therefore consider
Of his mercy He hath made for you the night and the day, that ye may rest in the one, and may seek to obtain provision for your selves of his abundance, by your industry, in the other; and that ye may give thanks
On a certain day God shall call unto them, and shall say, where are my partners, which ye imagined to share the divine power with Me
And We will produce a witness out of every nation, and will say, bring hither your proof of what ye have asserted. And they shall know that the right is God's alone; and the deities which they have devised shall abandon them
Karun was of the people of Moses; but he behaved insolently towards them: For We had given him so much treasure, that his keys would have loaded several strong men. When his people said unto Him, rejoice not immoderately; for God loveth not those who rejoice in their riches immoderately
But seek to attain, by means of the wealth which God hath given thee, the future mansion of paradise. And forget not thy portion in this world; but be thou bounteous unto others, as God hath been bounteous unto thee: And seek not to act corruptly in the earth; for God loveth not the corrupt doers
He answered, I have received these riches, only because of the knowledge which is with me. Did he not know that God had already destroyed, before him, several generations, who were mightier than he in strength, and had amassed more abundance of riches? And the wicked shall not be asked to discover their crimes
And Karun went forth unto his people, in his pomp. And they who loved this present life, said, oh that we had the like wealth, as hath been given unto Karun! Verily he is master of a great fortune
But those on whom knowledge had been bestowed, answered, alas for you! The reward of God in the next life, will be better unto him who shall believe and do good works: But none shall attain the same, except those who persevere with constancy
And We caused the ground to cleave in sunder, and to swallow up him and his palace: And he had no forces to defend him, besides God; neither was he rescued from punishment
And the next morning, those who had coveted his condition the day before, said, aha! Verily God bestoweth abundant provision on such of his servants as He pleaseth; and He is sparing unto whom He pleaseth. Unless God had been gracious unto us, certainly the earth had swallowed us up also. Aha! The unbelievers shall not prosper
As to this future mansion of paradise, We will give it unto them who seek not to exalt themselves in the earth, or to do wrong; for the happy issue shall attend the pious
Whoso doth good, shall receive a reward which shall exceed the merit thereof: But as to him who doth evil, they who work evil shall be rewarded according to the merit only of that which they shall have wrought
Verily He who hath given thee the Koran for a rule of faith and practice, will certainly bring thee back home unto Mecca. Say, my Lord best knoweth who cometh with a true direction, and who is in a manifest error
Thou didst not expect that the book of the Koran should be delivered unto thee: But thou hast received it through the mercy of thy Lord. Be not therefore assisting to the unbelievers
neither let them turn thee aside from the signs of God, after they have been sent down unto thee: And invite men unto thy Lord. And be not thou an idolater
neither invoke any other god, together with the true God: There is no god but He. Every thing shall perish, except Himself: Unto Him belongeth judgment; and before Him shall ye be assembled at the last day
M
Do men imagine that it shall be sufficient for them to say, we believe; while they be not proved
We heretofore proved those who were before them; for God will surely know them who are sincere, and He will surely know the liars
Do they who work evil think that they shall prevent Us from taking vengeance on them? An ill judgment do they make
Whoso hopeth to meet God, verily God's appointed time will certainly come; and He both heareth and knoweth
Whoever striveth to promote the true religion, striveth for the advantage of his own soul; for God needeth not any of his creatures
And as to those who believe and work righteousness, We will expiate their evil deeds from them; and We will give them a reward according to the utmost merit of their actions
We have commanded man to shew kindness towards his parents: But if they endeavour to prevail with thee to associate with Me that concerning which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not. Unto Me shall ye return; and I will declare unto you what ye have done
Those who shall believe, and shall work righteousness, We will surely introduce into paradise, among the upright
There are some men who say, we believe in God: But when such a one is afflicted for God's sake, he esteemeth the persecution of men to be as grievous as the punishment of God. Yet if success cometh from thy Lord, they say, verily we are with you. Doth not God well know that which is in the breasts of his creatures
Verily God well knoweth the true believers, and He well knoweth the hypocrites
The unbelievers say unto those who believe, follow our way; and we will bear your sins. Howbeit they shall not bear any part of their sins; for they are liars
But they shall surely bear their own burdens, and other burdens besides their own burdens; and they shall be examined, on the day of resurrection, concerning that which they have falsely devised
We heretofore sent Noah unto his people; and he tarried among them one thousand years, save fifty years: And the deluge took them away, while they were acting unjustly
but We delivered him and those who were in the ark, and We made the same a sign unto all creatures
We also sent Abraham; when he said unto his people, serve God, and fear Him: This will be better for you; if ye understand
Ye only worship idols besides God, and forge a lie. Verily those which ye worship, besides God, are not able to make any provision for you: Seek therefore your provision from God; and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him; unto Him shall ye return
If ye charge me with imposture, verily sundry nations before you likewise charged their prophets with imposture: But public preaching only is incumbent on an apostle
Do they not see how God produceth creatures, and afterwards restoreth them? Verily this is easy with God
Say, go through the earth, and see how He originally produceth creatures: Afterwards will God reproduce another production; for God is almighty
He will punish whom He pleaseth, and He will have mercy on whom He pleaseth. Before Him shall ye be brought at the day of judgment
And ye shall not escape his reach, either in earth, or in heaven; neither shall ye have any patron or defender besides God
As for those who believe not in the signs of God, or that they shall meet Him at the resurrection, they shall despair of my mercy, and for them is a painful punishment prepared
And the answer of his people was no other than that they said, slay him, or burn him. But God saved him from the fire. Verily herein were signs unto people who believed
And Abraham said, ye have taken idols, besides God, to cement affection between you in this life: But on the day of resurrection, the one of you shall deny the other, and the one of you shall curse the other; and your abode shall be hell fire, and there shall be none to deliver you
And Lot believed on Him. And Abraham said, verily I fly from my people, unto the place which my Lord hath commanded me; for He is the mighty, the wise
And We gave him Isaac, and Jacob; and We placed among his descendants the gift of prophecy and the scriptures: And We gave him his reward in this world; and in the next he shall be one of the righteous
We also sent Lot; when he said unto his people, do ye commit filthiness which no creature hath committed before you
Do ye approach lustfully unto men, and lay wait in the highways, and commit wickedness in your assembly? And the answer of his people was no other than that they said, bring down the vengeance of God upon us, if thou speakest truth
Lot said, O Lord, defend me against the corrupt people
And when our messengers came unto Abraham with good tidings, they said, we will surely destroy the inhabitants of this city; for the inhabitants thereof are unjust doers
Abraham answered, verily Lot dwelleth there. They replied, we well know who dwelleth therein: we will surely deliver him and his family, except his wife; she shall be one of those who remain behind
And when our messengers came unto Lot, he was troubled for them, and his arm was straitened concerning them. But they said, fear not, neither be grieved; for we will deliver thee and thy family, except thy wife; for she shall be one of those who remain behind
We will surely bring down upon the inhabitants of this city vengeance from heaven, for that they have been wicked doers
And We have left thereof a manifest sign unto people who understand
And unto the inhabitants of Madian We sent their brother Shoaib; and he said unto them, O my people, serve God, and expect the last day; and transgress not, acting corruptly in the earth
But they accused him of imposture; wherefore a storm from heaven assailed them, and in the morning they were found in their dwellings dead and prostrate
And We also destroyed the tribes of Ad, and Thamud; and this is well known unto you from what yet remains of their dwellings. And Satan prepared their works for them, and turned them aside from the way of truth; although they were sagacious people
And We likewise destroyed Karun, and Pharaoh, and Haman. Moses came unto them with evident miracles; and they behaved themselves insolently in the earth: But they could not escape our vengeance
Every of them did We destroy in his sin. Against some of them We sent a violent wind: Some of them did a terrible noise from heaven destroy: Some of them did We cause the earth to swallow up: And some of them We drowned. Neither was God disposed to treat them unjustly; but they dealt unjustly with their own souls
The likness of those who take other patrons besides God, is as the likeness of the spider, which maketh herself a house: But the weakest of all houses surely is the house of the spider; if they knew this
Moreover God knoweth what things they invoke, besides Him; and He is the mighty, the wise
These similitudes do We propound unto men: But none understand them, except the wise
God hath created the heavens and the earth in truth: Verily herein is a sign unto the true believers
Rehearse that which hath been revealed unto thee of the book of the Koran: And be constant at prayer; for prayer preserveth a man from filthy crimes, and from that which is blamable; and the remembering of God is surely a most important duty. God knoweth that which ye do
Dispute not against those who have received the scriptures, unless in the mildest manner; except against such of them as behave injuriously towards you: And say, we believe in the revelation which hath been sent down unto us, and also in that which hath been sent down unto you; our God and your God is one, and unto Him are we resigned
Thus have We sent down the book of the Koran unto thee: And they unto whom We have given the former scriptures, believe therein; and of these Arabians also there is who believeth therein: And none reject our signs, except the obstinate infidels

But the same is evident signs in the breasts of those who have received understanding: For none reject our signs, except the unjust

Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down unto thee the book of the Koran, to be read unto them? Verily herein is a mercy, and an admonition unto people who believe
Say, God is a sufficient witness between me and you: He knoweth whatever is in heaven and earth; and those who believe in vain idols, and deny God, they shall perish
They will urge thee to hasten the punishment which they defy thee to bring down upon them: If there had not been a determined time for their respite, the punishment had come upon them before this; but it shall surely overtake them suddenly, and they shall not foresee it
They urge thee to bring down vengeance swiftly upon them: But hell shall surely encompass the unbelievers
On a certain day their punishment shall suddenly assail them, both from above them, and from under their feet; and God shall say, taste ye the reward of that which ye have wrought
O my servants who have believed, verily my earth is spacious; wherefore serve Me
Every soul shall taste death: Afterwards shall ye return unto Us
and as for those who shall have believed, and wrought righteousness, We will surely lodge them in the higher apartments of paradise; rivers shall flow beneath them, and they shall continue therein for ever. How excellent will be the reward of the workers of righteousness
who persevere with patience, and put their trust in their Lord
How many beasts are there, which provide not their food? It is God who provideth food for them, and for you; and He both heareth and knoweth
Verily, if thou ask the Meccans, who hath created the heavens and the earth, and hath obliged the sun and the moon to serve in their courses; they will answer, God. How therefore do they lie, in acknowledging of other gods
God maketh abundant provision for such of his servants as He pleaseth; and is sparing unto him, if he pleaseth: For God knoweth all things
Verily if thou ask them, who sendeth rain from heaven, and thereby quickeneth the earth, after it hath been dead; they will answer, God. Say, God be praised! But the greater part of them do not understand
This present life is no other than a toy, and a play-thing; but the future mansion of paradise is life indeed: If they knew this, they would not prefer the former to the latter
When they sail in a ship, they call upon God, sincerely exhibiting unto Him the true religion: But when He bringeth them safe to land, behold, they return to their idolatry
to shew themselves ungrateful for that which We have bestowed on them, and that they may enjoy the delights of this life; but they shall hereafter know the issue
Do they not see that We have made the territory of Mecca an inviolable and secure asylum, when men are spoiled in the countries round about them? Do they therefore believe in that which is vain, and acknowledge not the goodness of God
But who is more unjust than he who deviseth a lie against God, or denieth the truth, when it hath come unto him? Is there not in hell an abode for the unbelievers
Whoever do their utmost endeavour to promote our true religion, We will direct them into our ways; for God is with the righteous
M
The Greeks have been overcome by the Persians
in the nearest part of the land; but after their defeat, they shall overcome the others in their turn
within a few years. Unto God belongeth the disposal of this matter, both for what is past, and for what is to come: And on that day shall the believers rejoice
in the success granted by God; for He granteth success unto whom He pleaseth, and He is the mighty, the merciful
This is the promise of God: God will not act contrary to his promise; but the greater part of men know not the veracity of God
They know the outward appearance of this present life; but they are careless as to the life to come
Do they not consider within themselves that God hath not created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, otherwise than in truth, and hath set them a determined period? Verily a great number of men reject the belief of their future meeting their Lord at the resurrection
Do they not pass through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who were before them? They excelled the Meccans in strength, and broke up the earth, and inhabited it in greater affluence and prosperity than they inhabit the same: And their apostles came unto them with evident miracles; and God was not disposed to treat them unjustly, but they injured their own souls by their obstinate infidelity
and the end of those who had done evil, was evil, because they charged the signs of God with falsehood, and laughed the same to scorn
God produceth creatures, and will hereafter restore them to life: Then shall ye return unto Him
And on the day whereon the hour shall come, the wicked shall be struck dumb for despair
And they shall have no intercessors from among the idols which they associated with God; and they shall deny the false gods which they associated with Him
On the day whereon the hour shall come, on that day shall the true believers and the infidels be separated
And they who shall have believed, and wrought righteousness, shall take their pleasure in a delightful meadow
but as for those who shall have disbelieved, and rejected our signs, and the meeting of the next life, they shall be delivered up to punishment
Wherefore glorify God, when the evening overtaketh you, and when ye rise in the morning
And unto Him be praise in heaven and earth; and at sun-set, and when ye rest at noon
He bringeth forth the living out of the dead, and He bringeth forth the dead out of the living; and He quickeneth the earth after it hath been dead: And in like manner shall ye be brought forth from your graves
Of his signs one is, that He hath created you of dust; and behold, ye are become men, spread over the face of the earth
And of his signs another is, that He hath created for you, out of your selves, wives, that ye may cohabit with them; and hath put love and compassion between you: Verily herein are signs unto people who consider
And of his signs are also the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the variety of your languages, and of your complexions: Verily herein are signs unto men of understanding
And of his signs are your sleeping by night and by day, and your seeking to provide for yourselves of his abundance: Verily herein are signs unto people who hearken
Of his signs others are, that He sheweth you the lightening, to strike terror, and to give hope of rain, and that He sendeth down water from heaven, and quickeneth thereby the earth, after it hath been dead: Verily herein are signs unto people who understand
And of his signs this also is one, namely, that the heaven and the earth stand firm at his command: Hereafter, when He shall call you out of the earth at one summons, behold, ye shall come forth
Unto Him are subject whosoever are in the heavens and on earth: All are obedient unto Him
It is He who originally produceth a creature, and afterwards restoreth the same to life: And this is most easy with Him. He justly challengeth the most exalted comparison, in heaven and earth; and He is the mighty, the wise
He propoundeth unto you a comparison taken from yourselves. Have ye, among the slaves whom your right hands possess, any partner in the substance which We have bestowed on you, so that ye become equal sharers therein with them, or that ye fear them as ye fear one another? Thus do We distinctly explain our signs, unto people who understand
But those who act unjustly by attributing companions unto God, follow their own lusts, without knowledge: And who shall direct him whom God shall cause to err? They shall have none to help them
Wherefore be thou orthodox, and set thy face towards the true religion, the institution of God, to which He hath created mankind disposed: There is no change in what God hath created. This is the right religion; but the greater part of men know it not
And be ye turned unto Him, and fear Him, and be constant at prayer, and be not idolaters
Of those who have made a schism in their religion, and are divided into various sects; every sect rejoice in their own opinion
When adversity befalleth men, they call upon their Lord, turning unto Him: Afterwards, when He hath caused them to taste of his mercy, behold, a part of them associate other deities with their Lord
to shew themselves ungrateful for the favours which We have bestowed on them. Enjoy therefore the vain pleasures of this life; but hereafter shall ye know the consequence
Have We sent down unto them any authority, which speaketh of the false gods which they associate with Him
When We cause men to taste mercy, they rejoice therein; but if evil befalleth them, for that which their hands have before committed, behold, they despair
Do they not see that God bestoweth provision abundantly on whom He pleaseth, and is sparing unto whom He pleaseth? Verily herein are signs unto people who believe
Give unto Him who is of kin to thee his reasonable due; and also to the poor, and the stranger: This is better for those who seek the face of God; and they shall prosper
Whatever ye shall give in usury, to be an increase of men's substance, shall not be increased by the blessing of God: But whatever ye shall give in alms, for God's sake, they shall receive a twofold reward
It is God who hath created you, and hath provided food for you: Hereafter will He cause you to die; and after that will He raise you again to life. Is there any of your false gods, who is able to do the least of these things? Praise be unto Him; and far be He removed from what they associate with Him
Corruption hath appeared by land and by sea, for the crimes which men's hands have committed; that it might make them to taste a part of the fruits of that which they have wrought, that peradventure they might turn from their evil ways

Whoever shall have been an unbeliever, on Him shall his unbelief be charged; and whoever shall have done that which is right, shall spread themselves couches of repose in paradise
that He may reward those who shall believe, and work righteousness, of his abundant liberality; for He loveth not the unbelievers
Of his signs one is, that He sendeth the winds, bearing welcome tidings of rain, that He may cause you to taste of his mercy; and that ships may sail at his command, that ye may seek to enrich your selves of his abundance by commerce; and that ye may give thanks
We sent apostles, before thee, unto their respective people, and they came unto them with evident proofs: And We took vengeance on those who did wickedly; and it was incumbent on Us to assist the true believers
It is God who sendeth the winds, and raiseth the clouds, and spreadeth the same in the heaven, as He pleaseth; and afterwards disperseth the same: And thou mayest see the rain issuing from the midst thereof; and when He poureth the same down on such of his servants as He pleaseth, behold, they are filled with joy
although before it was sent down unto them, before such relief, they were despairing
Consider therefore the traces of God's mercy; how He quickeneth the earth, after its state of death: Verily the same will raise the dead; for He is almighty
Yet if We should send a blasting wind, and they should see their corn yellow and burnt up, they would surely become ungrateful, after our former favours
Thou canst not make the dead to hear, neither canst thou make the deaf to hear thy call, when they retire and turn their backs
neither canst thou direct the blind out of their error: Thou shalt make none to hear, except him who shall believe in our signs; for they are resigned unto Us
It is God who created you in weakness, and after weakness hath given you strength; and after strength, he will again reduce you to weakness, and grey hairs: He createth that which He pleaseth; and He is the wise, the powerful
On the day whereon the last hour shall come, the wicked will swear that they have not tarried above an hour: In like manner did they utter lies in their life-time
But those on whom knowledge hath been bestowed, and faith, will say, ye have tarried, according to the book of God, until the day of resurrection: For this is the day of resurrection; but ye knew it not
On that day their excuse shall not avail those who have acted unjustly; neither shall they be invited any more to make themselves acceptable unto God
And now have We propounded unto men, in this Koran, parables of every kind: Yet if thou bring them a verse thereof, the unbelievers will surely say, ye are no other than publishers of vain falsehoods
Thus hath God sealed up the hearts of those who believe not
But do thou, O Mohammed, persevere with constancy, for the promise of God is true; and let not those induce thee to waver, who have no certain knowledge
M
These are the signs of the wise book
a direction, and a mercy unto the righteous
who observe the appointed times of prayer, and give alms, and have firm assurance in the life to come
These are directed by their Lord, and they shall prosper

they shall continue therein for ever: This is the certain promise of God; and he is the mighty, the wise

This is the creation of God: Shew Me now what they have created, who are worshipped besides Him? Verily the ungodly are in a manifest error
We heretofore bestowed wisdom on Lokman, and commanded him, saying, be thou thankful unto God: For whoever is thankful, shall be thankful to the advantage of his own soul; and if any shall be unthankful, verily God is self-sufficient, and worthy to be praised
And remember when Lokman said unto his son, as he admonished him, O my son, give not a partner unto God; for polytheism is a great impiety
We have commanded man concerning his parents, -- his mother carrieth him in her womb with weakness and faintness, and he is weaned in two years, -- saying, be grateful unto Me, and to thy parents. Unto Me shall all come to be judged
But if thy parents endeavour to prevail on thee to associate with Me that concerning which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not: Bear them company in this world in what shall be reasonable; but follow the way of him who sincerely turneth unto Me. Hereafter unto Me shall ye return, and then will I declare unto you that which ye have done
O my son, verily every matter, whether good or bad, though it be of the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and be hidden in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, God will bring the same to light; for God is clear-sighted and knowing
O my son, be constant at prayer, and command that which is just, and forbid that which is evil: And be patient under the afflictions which shall befall thee; for this is a duty absolutely incumbent on all men
Distort not thy face out of contempt to men, neither walk in the earth with insolence; for God loveth no arrogant, vain-glorious person
And be moderate in thy pace: And lower thy voice; for the most ungrateful of all voices surely is the voice of asses
Do ye not see that God hath subjected whatever is in heaven and on earth to your service, and hath abundantly poured on you his favours, both outwardly and inwardly? There are some men who dispute concerning God without knowledge, and without a direction, and without an enlightening book
And when it is said unto them, follow that which God hath revealed; they answer, nay, we will follow that which we found our fathers to practise. What, though the devil invite them to the torment of hell
Whoever resigneth himself unto God, being a worker of righteousness, taketh hold on a strong handle; and unto God belongeth the issue of all things

We will suffer them to enjoy this world for a little while: Afterwards We will drive them to a severe punishment
If thou ask them who hath created the heavens and the earth, they will surely answer, God. Say, God be praised! But the greater part of them do not understand
Unto God belongeth whatever is in heaven and earth: For God is the self-sufficient, the praise-worthy
If whatever trees are in the earth were pens, and he should after that swell the sea into seven seas of ink, the words of God would not be exhausted; for God is mighty, and wise
Your creation and your resuscitation are but as the creation and resuscitation of one soul: Verily God both heareth and seeth
Dost thou not see that God causeth the night to succeed the day, and causeth the day to succeed the night, and compelleth the sun and the moon to serve you? Each of those luminaries hasteneth in its course to a determined period: And God is well-acquainted with that which ye do
This is declared concerning the divine knowledge and power, for that God is the true being, and for that whatever ye invoke, besides him, is vanity; and for that God is the high, the great God
Dost thou not see that the ships run in the sea, through the favour of God, that he may shew you of his signs? Verily herein are signs, unto every patient, grateful person
When waves cover them, like overshadowing clouds, they call upon God, exhibiting the pure religion unto him; but when He bringeth them safe to land, there is of them who halteth between the true faith and idolatry
O men, fear your Lord, and dread the day whereon a father shall not make satisfaction for his son, neither shall a son make satisfaction for his father at all: The promise of God is assuredly true. Let not this present life, therefore, deceive you; neither let the deceiver deceive you concerning God
Verily the knowledge of the hour of judgment is with God: And He causeth the rain to descend, at his own appointed time; and He knoweth what is in the wombs of females. No soul knoweth what it shall gain on the morrow; neither doth any soul know in what land it shall die: But God is knowing and fully acquainted with all things
M
The revelation of this book, there is no doubt thereof, is from the Lord of all creatures
Will they say, Mohammed hath forged it? Nay, it is the truth from thy Lord, that thou mayest preach to a people, unto whom no preacher hath come before thee; peradventure they will be directed
It is God who hath created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, in six days; and then ascended his throne. Ye have no patron or intercessor besides Him. Will ye not therefore consider
He governeth all things from heaven even to the earth: Hereafter shall they return unto Him, on the day whose length shall be a thousand years, of those which ye compute
This is He who knoweth the future, and the present; the mighty, the merciful
It is He who hath made every thing which He hath created exceeding good; and first created man of clay
and afterwards made his posterity of an extract of despicable water
and then formed him into proper shape, and breathed of his spirit into him; and hath given you the senses of hearing and seeing, and hearts to understand. How small thanks do ye return
And they say, when we shall lie hidden in the earth, shall we be raised thence a new creature? Yea, they deny the meeting of their Lord at the resurrection
Say, the angel of death, who is set over you, shall cause you to die: Then shall ye be brought back unto your Lord
If thou couldest see, when the wicked shall bow down their heads before their Lord, saying, O Lord, we have seen, and have heard: Suffer us therefore to return into the world, and we will work that which is right; since we are now certain of the truth of what hath been preached to us: Thou wouldst see an amazing sight
If we had pleased, we had certainly given unto every soul its direction: But the word which hath proceeded from Me must necessarily be fulfilled, when I said, verily I will fill hell with genii and men, altogether
Taste therefore the torment prepared for you, because ye have forgotten the coming of this your day: We also have forgotten you; taste therefore a punishment of eternal duration, for that which ye have wrought
Verily they only believe in our signs, who, when they are warned thereby, fall down adoring, and celebrate the praise of their Lord, and are not elated with pride

No soul knoweth the complete satisfaction which is secretly prepared for them, as a reward for that which they have wrought
Shall he therefore, who is a true believer, be as he who is an impious transgressor? They shall not be held equal
As to those who believe, and do that which is right, they shall have gardens of perpetual abode, an ample recompense for that which they shall have wrought
But as for those who impiously transgress, their abode shall be hell fire; so often as they shall endeavour to get thereout, they shall be dragged back into the same, and it shall be said unto them, taste ye the torment of hell fire, which ye rejected as a falsehood
And we will cause them to taste the nearer punishment of this world, besides the more grievous punishment of the next; peradventure they will repent
Who is more unjust than he who is warned by the signs of his Lord, and then turneth aside from the same? We will surely take vengeance on the wicked
We heretofore delivered the book of the law unto Moses; wherefore be not thou in doubt as to the revelation thereof: And we ordained the same to be a direction unto the children of Israel

Verily thy Lord will judge between them, on the day of resurrection, concerning that wherein they have disagreed
Is it not known unto them how many generations we have destroyed before them, through whose dwellings they walk? Verily herein are signs: Will they not therefore hearken
Do they not see that We drive rain unto a land bare of grass and parched up, and thereby produce corn, of which their cattle eat, and themselves also? Will they not therefore regard
The infidels say to the true believers, when will this decision be made between us, if ye speak truth

O prophet, fear God, and obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites: Verily God is knowing and wise
But follow that which is revealed unto thee from thy Lord; for God is well-acquainted with that which ye do
And put thy trust in God; for God is a sufficient protector
God hath not given a man two hearts within him; neither hath he made your wives -- some of whom ye divorce, regarding them thereafters as your mothers -- your true mothers; nor hath he made your adopted sons your true sons. This is your saying in your mouths: But God speaketh the truth ; and he directeth the right way
Call such as are adopted, the sons of their natural fathers: This will be more just in the sight of God. And if ye know not their fathers, let them be as your brethren in religion, and your companions: And it shall be no crime in you, that ye err in this matter; but that shall be criminal which your hearts purposely design; for God is gracious and merciful
The prophet is nigher unto the true believers than their own souls; and his wives are their mothers. Those who are related by consanguinity are nigher of kin the one of them unto the others, according to the book of God, than the other true believers, and the Mohajerun: Unless that ye do what is fitting and reasonable to your relations in general. This is written in the book of God
Remember when we accepted their covenant from the prophets, and from thee, O Mohammed, and from Noah, and Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus the son of Mary, and received from them a firm covenant
that God may examine the speakers of truth concerning their veracity: And He hath prepared a painful torment for the unbelievers
O true believers, remember the favour of God towards you, when armies of infidels came against you, and We sent against them a wind, and hosts of angels which ye saw not: And God beheld that which ye did
When they came against you from above you, and from below you, and when your sight became troubled, and your hearts came even to your throats for fear, and ye imagined of God various imaginations
There were the faithful tried, and made to tremble with a violent trembling
And when the hypocrites, and those in whose heart was an infirmity, said, God and his apostle have made you no other than a fallacious promise
And when a party of them said, O inhabitants of Yathreb, there is no place of security for you here; wherefore return home. And a part of them asked leave of the prophet to depart, saying, verily our houses are defenceless and exposed to the enemy: But they were not defenceless; and their intention was no other than to fly
If the city had been entered upon them by the enemy from the parts adjacent, and they had been asked to desert the true believers, and to fight against them; they had surely consented thereto: But they had not, in such case, remained in the same, but a little while
They had before made a covenant with God, that they would not turn their backs: And the performance of their covenant with God shall be examined into hereafter
Say, flight shall not profit you, if ye fly from death or from slaughter: And if it would, yet shall ye not enjoy this world but a little
Say, who is he who shall defend you against God, if He is pleased to bring evil on you, or is pleased to shew mercy towards you? They shall find none to patronize or protect them, besides God
God already knoweth those among you who hinder others from following his apostle, and who say unto their brethren, come hither unto us; and who come not to battle, except a little
being covetous towards you: But when fear cometh on them, thou seest them look unto thee for assistance, their eyes rolling about, like the eyes of him who fainteth by reason of the agonies of death: Yet when their fear is past, they inveigh against you with sharp tongues; being covetous of the best and most valuable part of the spoils. These believe not sincerely; wherefore God hath rendered their works of no avail; and this is easy with God
They imagined that the confederates would not depart and raise the siege: And if the confederates should come another time, they would wish to live in the deserts among the Arabs who dwell in tents, and there to inquire after news concerning you; and although they were with you this time, yet they fought not, except a little
Ye have in the apostle of God an excellent example, unto him who hopeth in God, and the last day, and remembereth God frequently
When the true believers saw the confederates, they said, this is what God and his apostle have foretold us; and God and his apostle have spoken the truth: And it only increased their faith and resignation
Of the true believers some men justly performed what they had promised unto God; and some of them have finished their course, and some of them wait the same advantage; and they changed not their promise, by deviating therefrom in the least
That God may reward the just performers of their covenant for their fidelity; and may punish the hypocritical, if He pleaseth, or may be turned unto them; for God is ready to forgive, and merciful
God hath driven back the infidels in their wrath: They obtained no advantage; and God was a sufficient protector unto the faithful in battle; for God is strong and mighty
And He hath caused such of those who have received the scriptures, as assisted the confederates, to come down out of their fortresses, and He cast into their hearts terror and dismay: A part of them ye slew, and a part ye made captives
and God hath caused you to inherit their land, and their houses, and their wealth, and a land on which ye have not trodden; for God is almighty
O prophet, say unto thy wives, if ye seek this present life, and the pomp thereof, come, I will make a handsome provision for you, and I will dismiss you with an honourable dismission
But if ye seek God and his apostle, and the life to come, verily God hath prepared for such of you as work righteousness, a great reward
O wives of the prophet, whosoever of you shall commit a manifest wickedness, the punishment thereof shall be doubled unto her twofold; and this is easy with God
But whosoever of you shall be obedient unto God and his apostle, and shall do that which is right, We will give her reward twice, and We have prepared for her an honourable provision in paradise
O wives of the prophet, ye are not as other women: If ye fear God, be not too complaisant in speech, lest he should covet, in whose heart is a disease of incontinence; but speak the speech which is convenient
And sit still in your houses; and set not out your selves with the ostentation of the former time of ignorance: And observe the appointed times of prayer, and give alms; and obey God, and his apostle; for God desireth only to remove from you the abomination of vanity, since ye are the houshould of the prophet, and to purify you by a perfect purification
And remember that which is read in your houses, of the signs of God, and of the wisdom revealed in the Koran; for God is clear-sighted, and well-acquainted with your actions
Verily the Moslems of either sex, and the true believers of either sex, and the devout men, and the devout women, and the men of veracity, and the women of veracity, and the patient men, and the patient women, and the humble men and the humble women, and the alms-givers of either sex, and the men who fast, and the women who fast, and the chaste men, and the chaste women, and those of either sex who remember God frequently; for them hath God prepared forgiveness, and a great reward
It is not fit for a true believer of either sex, when God and his apostle have decreed a thing, that they should have the liberty of choosing a different matter of their own: And whoever is disobedient unto God and his apostle, surely erreth with a manifest error
And remember when thou saidst to him unto whom God had been gracious, and on whom thou also hadst conferred favours, keep thy wife to thy self, and fear God: And thou didst conceal that in thy mind which God had determined to discover, and didst fear men; whereas it was more just that thou shouldst fear God. But when Zeid had determined the matter concerning her, and had resolved to divorce her, we joined her in marriage unto thee; lest a crime should be charged on the true believers, in marrying the wives of their adopted sons, when they have determined the matter concerning them: And the command of God is to be performed
No crime is to be charged on the prophet, as to what God hath allowed him, conformable to the ordinance of God with regard to those who preceded him, -- for the command of God is a determinate decree
who brought the messages of God, and feared him, and feared none besides God: And God is a sufficient accountant
Mohammed is not the father of any man among you; but the apostle of God, and the seal of the prophets: And God knoweth all things
O true believers, remember God with a frequent remembrance
and celebrate his praise morning and evening
It is He who is gracious unto you, and his angels intercede for you, that He may lead you forth from darkness into light; and He is merciful towards the true believers
Their salutation, on the day whereon they shall meet Him, shall be, peace! And He hath prepared for them an honourable recompense
O prophet, verily We have sent thee to be a witness, and a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats
and an inviter unto God, through his good pleasure, and a shining light
Bear good tidings therefore unto the true believers, that they shall receive great abundance from God
And obey not the unbelievers, and the hypocrites, and mind not their evil treatment: But trust in God; and God is a sufficient protector
O true believers, when ye marry women who are believers, and afterwards put them away, before ye have touched them, there is no term prescribed you to fulfil towards them after their divorce: But make them a present, and dismiss them freely, with an honourable dismission
O prophet, We have allowed thee thy wives unto whom thou hast given their dower, and also the slaves which thy right hand possesseth, of the booty which God hath granted thee; and the daughters of thy uncle, and the daughters of thy aunts, both on thy father's side, and on thy mother's side, who have fled with thee from Mecca, and any other believing woman, if she give herself unto the prophet; in case the prophet desireth to take her to wife. This is a peculiar privilege granted unto thee, above the rest of the true believers. We know what we have ordained them concerning their wives, and the slaves whom their right hands possess: Lest it should be deemed a crime in thee to make use of the privilege granted thee; for God is gracious and merciful
Thou mayest postpone the turn of such of thy wives as thou shalt please, in being called to thy bed; and thou mayest take unto thee her whom thou shalt please, and her whom thou shalt desire of those whom thou shalt have before rejected: And it shall be no crime in thee. This will be more easy, that they may be entirely content, and may not be grieved, but may be well pleased with what thou shalt give every of them: God knoweth whatever is in your hearts; and God is knowing and gracious
It shall not be lawful for thee to take other women to wife hereafter, nor to exchange any of thy wives for them, although their beauty please thee; except the slaves whom thy right hand shall possess: And God observeth all things
O true believers, enter not the houses of the prophet, unless it be permitted you to eat meat with him, without waiting his convenient time: But when ye are invited, then enter. And when ye shall have eaten, disperse yourselves; and stay not to enter into familiar discourse: For this incommodeth the prophet. He is ashamed to bid you depart; but God is not ashamed of the truth. And when ye ask of the prophet's wives what ye may have occasion for, ask it of them from behind a curtain. This will be more pure for your hearts and their hearts. Neither is it fit for you to give any uneasiness to the apostle of God, or to marry his wives after him for ever: For this would be a grievous thing in the sight of God
Whether ye divulge a thing, or conceal it, verily God knoweth all things
It shall be no crime in them as to their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their brothers sons, or their sisters sons, or their women, or the slaves which their right hands possess, if they speak to them unveiled: and fear ye God; for God is witness of all things
Verily God and his angels bless the prophet: O true believers, do ye also bless him, and salute him with a respectful salutation
As to those who offend God and his apostle, God shall curse them in this world and in the next; and He hath prepared for them a shameful punishment
And they who shall injure the true believers of either sex, without their deserving it, shall surely bear the guilt of calumny and a manifest injustice
O prophet, speak unto thy wives, and thy daughters, and the wives of the true believers, that they cast their outer garments over them when they walk abroad; this will be more proper, that they may be known to be matrons of reputation, and may not be affronted by unseemly words or actions. God is gracious and merciful
Verily if the hypocrites, and those in whose hearts is an infirmity, and they who raise disturbances in Medina, do not desist; we will surely stir thee up against them, to chastise them: Henceforth they shall not be suffered to dwell near thee therein, except for a little time
and being accursed; wherever they are found they shall be taken, and killed with a general slaughter
according to the sentence of God concerning those who have been before; and thou shalt not find any change in the sentence of God
Men will ask thee concerning the approach of the last hour: Answer, verily the knowledge thereof is with God alone; and he will not inform thee: Peradventure the hour is nigh at hand
Verily God hath cursed the infidels, and hath prepared for them a fierce fire
wherein they shall remain for ever: They shall find no patron or defender
On the day whereon their faces shall be rolled in hell fire, they shall say, O that we had obeyed God, and had obeyed his apostle
And they shall say, O Lord, verily we have obeyed our lords, and our great men; and they have seduced us from the right way
O Lord, give them the double of our punishment; and curse them with a heavy curse
O true believers, be not as those who injured Moses; but God cleared him from the scandal which they had spoken concerning him; and he was of great consideration in the sight of God
O true believers, fear God, and speak words well-directed
that God may correct your works for you, and may forgive you your sins: And whoever shall obey God and his apostle, shall enjoy great felicity
We proposed the faith unto the heavens, and the earth, and the mountains: And they refused to undertake the same, and were afraid thereof; but man undertook it: Verily he was unjust to himself, and foolish
That God may punish the hypocritical men, and the hypocritical women, and the idolaters, and the idolatresses; and that God may be turned unto the true believers, both men and women; for God is gracious and merciful
Praise be to God, unto Whom belongeth whatever is in the heavens and on earth: And unto Him be praise in the world to come; for He is wise and intelligent
He knoweth whatsoever entereth into the earth, and whatsoever cometh out of the same, and whatsoever descendeth from heaven, and whatsoever ascendeth thereto: And He is merciful and ready to forgive
The unbelievers say, the hour of judgment will not come unto us. Answer, yea, by my Lord, it will surely come unto you; it is He who knoweth the hidden secret: The weight of an ant, either in heaven or in earth, is not absent from Him, nor any thing lesser than this or greater, but the same is written in the perspicuous book of his decrees
that He may recompense those who shall have believed, and wrought righteousness: They shall receive pardon, and an honourable provision
But they who endeavour to render our signs of none effect, shall receive a punishment of painful torment
Those unto whom knowledge hath been given, see that the book which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the truth, and directeth into the glorious and laudable way
The unbelievers say to one another, shall we shew you a man who shall prophesy unto you, that when ye shall have been dispersed with a total dispersion, ye shall be raised a new creature
He hath forged a lie concerning God, or rather he is distracted. But they who believe not in the life to come, shall fall into punishment and a wide error
Have they not therefore considered what is before them, and what is behind them, of the heaven and the earth? If We please, We will cause the earth to open and swallow them up, or will cause a piece of the heaven to fall upon them: Verily herein is a sign unto every servant, who turneth unto God
We heretofore bestowed on David excellence from Us: And We said, O mountains, sing alternate praises with him; and We obliged the birds also to join therein. And We softened the iron for him
saying, make thereof complete coats of mail, and rightly dispose the small plates which compose the same: And work ye righteousness, O family of David; for I see that which ye do
And We made the wind subject unto Solomon: It blew in the morning for a month, and in the evening for a month. And We made a fountain of molten brass to flow for him. And some of the genii were obliged to work in his presence, by the will of his Lord; and whoever of them turned aside from our command, We will cause him to taste the pain of hell fire
They made for him whatever he pleased, of palaces, and statues, and large dishes like fishponds, and cauldrons standing firm on their trevets; and We said, work righteousness, O family of David, with thanksgiving; for few of my servants are thankful
And when We had decreed that Solomon should die, nothing discovered his death unto them, except the creeping thing of the earth, which gnawed his staff. And when his body fell down, the genii plainly perceived that if they had known that which is secret, they had not continued in a vile punishment
The descendants of Saba had heretofore a sign in their dwellings; namely, two gardens, on the right hand and on the left: And it was said unto them, eat ye of the provision of your Lord, and give thanks unto Him; ye have a good country, and a gracious Lord
But they turned aside from what We had commanded them; wherefore We sent against them the inundation of al Arem, and We changed their two gardens for them into two gardens producing bitter fruit, and tamarisks, and some little fruit of the lote-tree
This We gave them in reward, because they were ungrateful: Is any thus rewarded except the ungrateful
And We placed between them and the cities which We have blessed, cities situate near each other; and We made the journey easy between them, saying, travel through the same by night and by day, in security
But they said, O Lord, put a greater distance between our journeys: And they were unjust unto themselves; and We made them the subject of discourse, and dispersed them with a total dispersion. Verily herein are signs, unto every patient, grateful person
And Eblis found his opinion of them to be true: And they followed him, except a party of the true believers
And he had no power over them, unless to tempt them, that We might know him who believed in the life to come, from him who doubted thereof. Thy Lord observeth all things
Say unto the idolaters, call upon those whom ye imagine to be gods, besides God: They are not masters of the weight of an ant in heaven or on earth, neither have they any share in the creation or government of the same; nor is any of them assistant to him therein
No intercession will be of service in his presence, except the intercession of him to whom he shall grant permission to intercede for others: And they shall wait in suspense until, when the terror shall be taken off from their hearts, they shall say to one another, what doth your Lord say? They shall answer, that which is just: And He is the high, the great God
Say, who provideth food for you from heaven and earth? Answer, God: And either we, or ye, follow the true direction, or are in a manifest error
Say, Ye shall not be examined concerning what we shall have committed: Neither shall we be examined concerning what ye shall have done
Say, our Lord will assemble us together at the last day: Then will He judge between us with truth; and He is the judge, the knowing
Say, shew me those whom ye have joined as partners with Him? Nay; rather He is the mighty, the wise God
We have not sent thee otherwise than unto mankind in general, a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats: But the greater part of men do not understand
And they say, when will this threat be fulfilled, if ye speak truth
Answer, a threat is denounced unto you of a day which ye shall not retard one hour, neither shall ye hasten
The unbelievers say, we will by no means believe in this Koran, nor in that which hath been revealed before it. But if thou couldest see when the unjust doers shall be set before their Lord! They will iterate discourse with one another: Those who were esteemed weak shall say unto those who behaved themselves arrogantly, had it not been for you, verily we had been true believers
They who behaved themselves arrogantly shall say unto those who were esteemed weak, did we turn you aside from the true direction, after it had come unto you? On the contrary, ye acted wickedly of your own free choice
And they who were esteemed weak shall say unto those who behaved with arrogance, nay, but the crafty plot which ye devised by night and by day, occasioned our ruin; when ye commanded us that we should not believe in God, and that we should set up other gods as equals unto him. And they shall conceal their repentance, after they shall have seen the punishment prepared for them. And we will put yokes on the necks of those who shall have disbelieved: Shall they be rewarded any otherwise than according to what they shall have wrought
We have sent no warner unto any city, but the inhabitants thereof who lived in affluence said, verily we believe not that with which ye are sent
And those of Mecca also say, we abound in riches and children more than ye; and we shall not be punished hereafter
Answer, verily my Lord will bestow provision in abundance unto whom he pleaseth, and will be sparing unto whom he pleaseth: But the greater part of men know not this
Neither your riches nor your children are the things which shall cause you to draw nigh unto us with a near approach: Only whoever believeth, and worketh righteousness, they shall receive a double reward for that which they shall have wrought; and they shall dwell in security, in the upper apartments of paradise
But they who shall endeavour to render our signs of none effect, shall be delivered up to punishment
Say, verily my Lord will bestow provision in abundance unto whom he pleaseth of his servants, and will be sparing unto whom he pleaseth: And whatever thing ye shall give in alms, he will return it; and he is the best provider of food
On a certain day he shall gather them all together: Then shall he say unto the angels, did these worship you
And the angels shall answer, God forbid! Thou art our friend, and not these: But they worshipped devils; the greater part of them believed in them
On this day the one of you shall not be able either to profit or to hurt the other. And we will say unto those who have acted unjustly, taste ye the pain of hell fire, which ye rejected as a falsehood
When our evident signs are read unto them, they say of thee, O Mohammed, this is no other than a man, who seeketh to turn you aside from the gods which your fathers worshipped. And they say of the Koran, this is no other than a lie blasphemously forged. And the unbelievers say of the truth, when it is come unto them, this is no other than manifest sorcery
Yet we have given them no books of scripture wherein to exercise themselves, nor have we sent unto them any warner before thee
They who were before them in like manner accused their prophets of imposture: But these have not arrived unto the tenth part of the riches and strength which we had bestowed on the former: And they accused my apostles of imposture; and how severe was my vengeance
Say, verily I advise you unto one thing, namely, that ye stand before God by two and two, and singly; and then consider seriously, and you will find that there is no madness in your companion Mohammed: He is no other than a warner unto you, sent before a severe punishment
Say, I ask not of you any reward for my preaching; it is your own, either to give or not: My reward is to be expected from God alone; and he is witness over all things
Say, verily my Lord sendeth down the truth to his prophets: He is the knower of secrets
Say, truth is come, and falsehood is vanished, and shall not return any more
Say, if I err, verily I shall err only against my own soul; But if I be rightly directed, it will be by that which my Lord revealeth unto me; for he is ready to hear, and nigh unto those who call upon him
If thou couldst see, when the unbelievers shall tremble, and shall find no refuge, and shall be taken from a near place
and shall say, we believe in him! But how shall they receive the faith from a distant place
Since they had before denied him, and reviled the mysteries of faith, from a distant place
And a bar shall be placed between them and that which they shall desire; as it hath been done with those who behaved like them heretofore: Because they have been in a doubt which hath caused scandal
Praise be unto God, the creator of heaven and earth; who maketh the angels his messengers, furnished with two, and three, and four pair of wings: God maketh what addition He pleaseth unto his creatures; for God is almighty
The mercy which God shall freely bestow on mankind, there is none who can with-hold; and what He shall with-hold, there is none who can bestow, besides Him: And He is the mighty, the wise
O men, remember the favour of God towards you: Is there any creator, besides God, who provideth food for you from heaven and earth? There is no God but He: How therefore are ye turned aside from acknowledging his unity
If they accuse thee of imposture, apostles before thee have also been accused of imposture: And unto God shall all things return
O men, verily the promise of God is true: Let not therefore the present life deceive you, neither let the deceiver deceive you concerning God
For Satan is an enemy unto you; wherefore hold him for an enemy: He only inviteth his confederates to be the inhabitants of hell
For those who believe not there is prepared a severe torment: But for those who shall believe and do that which is right, is prepared mercy and a great reward
Shall he therefore for whom his evil work hath been prepared, and who imagineth it to be good, be as he who is rightly disposed, and discerneth the truth? Verily God will cause to err whom He pleaseth, and will direct whom He pleaseth. Let not thy soul therefore be spent in sighs for their sakes, on account of their obstinacy; for God well knoweth that which they do
It is God who sendeth the winds, and raiseth a cloud; and We drive the same unto a dead country, and thereby quicken the earth after it hath been dead: So shall the resurrection be
Whoever desireth excellence; unto God doth all excellence belong: Unto Him ascendeth the good speech; and the righteous work will He exalt. But as for them who devise wicked plots, they shall suffer a severe punishment; and the device of those men shall be rendered vain
God created you first of the dust, and afterwards of seed: And He hath made you man and wife. No female conceiveth, or bringeth forth, but with his knowledge. Nor is any thing added unto the age of him whose life is prolonged, neither is any thing diminished from his age, but the same is written in the book of God's decrees. Verily this is easy with God
The two seas are not to be held in comparison: This is fresh and sweet, pleasant to drink; but that is salt and bitter: Yet out of each of them ye eat fish, and take ornaments for you to wear. Thou seest the ships also plowing the waves thereof, that ye may seek to enrich yourselves by commerce, of the abundance of God: Peradventure ye will be thankful
He causeth the night to succeed the day, and He causeth the day to succeed the night; and He obligeth the sun and the moon to perform their services: Each of them runneth an appointed course. This is God, your Lord: His is the kingdom. But the idols which ye invoke besides Him, have not the power even over the skin of a date-stone
If ye invoke them, they will not hear your calling; and although they should hear, yet they would not answer you. On the day of resurrection they shall disclaim your having associated them with God: And none shall declare unto thee the truth, like one who is well-acquainted therewith
O men, ye have need of God; but God is self-sufficient, and to be praised
If he pleaseth, he can take you away, and produce a new creature in your stead
Neither will this be difficult with God
A burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another: And if a heavy-burdened soul call on another to bear part of its burden, no part thereof shall be born by the person who shall be called on, although he be ever so nearly related. Thou shalt admonish those who fear their Lord in secret, and are constant at prayer: And whoever cleanseth himself from the guilt of disobedience cleanseth himself to the advantage of his own soul; for all shall be assembled before God at the last day
The blind and the seeing shall not be held equal
neither darkness and light
nor the cool shade and the scorching wind
Neither shall the living and the dead be held equal. God shall cause him to hear whom He pleaseth: But thou shalt not make those to hear who are in their graves
Thou art no other than a preacher
Verily We have sent thee with truth, a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats. There hath been no nation, but a preacher hath in past times been conversant among them
If they charge thee with imposture, they who were before them likewise charged their apostles with imposture. Their apostles came unto them with evident miracles, and with divine writings, and with the enlightening book
Afterwards I chastised those who were unbelievers; and how severe was my vengeance
Dost thou not see that God sendeth down rain from heaven; and that We thereby produce fruits of various colours? In the mountains also there are some tracks white and red, of various colours; and others are of a deep black
And of men, and beasts, and cattle there are whose colours are in like manner various. Such only of his servants fear God, as are indued with understanding: Verily God is mighty, and ready to forgive
Verily they who read the book of God, and are constant at prayer, and give alms out of what We have bestowed on them, both in secret and openly, hope for a merchandize which shall not perish
That God may fully pay them their wages, and make them a superabundant addition of his liberality; for He is ready to forgive the faults of his servants, and to requite their endeavours
That which We have revealed unto thee of the book of the Koran, is the truth, confirming the scriptures which were revealed before it: For God knoweth and regardeth his servants
And We have given the book of the Koran in heritage unto such of our servants as We have chosen: Of them there is one who injureth his own soul; and there is another of them who keepeth the middle way; and there is another of them who out-strippeth others in good works, by the permission of God. This is the great excellence
They shall be introduced into gardens of perpetual abode; they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their cloathing therein shall be of silk
And they shall say, praise be unto God, who hath taken away sorrow from us! Verily our Lord is ready to forgive the sinners, and to reward the obedient
Who hath caused us to take up our rest in a dwelling of eternal stability, through his bounty, wherein no labour shall touch us, neither shall any weariness affect us
But for the unbelievers is prepared the fire of hell: It shall not be decreed them to die a second time; neither shall any part of the punishment thereof be made lighter unto them. Thus shall every infidel be rewarded
And they shall cry out aloud in hell, saying, Lord, take us hence, and we will work righteousness, and not what we have formerly wrought. But it shall be answered them, did we not grant you lives of length sufficient, that whoever would be warned might be warned therein; and did not the preacher come unto you? Taste therefore the pains of hell. And the unjust shall have no protector
Verily God knoweth the secrets both of heaven and earth, for He knoweth the innermost parts of the breasts of men
It is He who hath made you to succeed in the earth. Whoever shall disbelieve, on him be his unbelief: And their unbelief shall only gain the unbelievers greater indignation in the sight of their Lord; and their unbelief shall only increase the perdition of the unbelievers
Say, what think ye of your deities which ye invoke besides God? Shew me what part of the earth they have created. Or had they any share in the creation of the heavens? Have We given unto the idolaters any book of revelations, so that they may rely on any proof therefrom to authorize their practice? Nay: But the ungodly make unto one another only deceitful promises
Verily God sustaineth the heavens and the earth, lest they fail: And if they should fail, none could support the same besides Him; He is gracious and merciful
The Koreish swore by God, with a most solemn oath, that if a preacher had come unto them, they would surely have been more willingly directed than any nation: But now a preacher is come unto them, it hath only increased in them their aversion from the truth
their arrogance in the earth, and their contriving of evil; but the contrivance of evil shall only encompass the authors thereof. Do they expect any other than the punishment awarded against the unbelievers of former times? For thou shalt not find any change in the ordinance of God; neither shalt thou find any variation in the ordinance of God
Have they not gone through the earth, and seen what hath been the end of those who were before them; although they were more mighty in strength than they? God is not to be frustrated by any thing either in heaven or on earth; for He is wise and powerful
If God should punish men according to what they deserve, He would not leave on the back of the earth so much as a beast: But He respiteth them to a determined time; and when their time shall come, verily God will regard his servants
S
I swear by the instructive Koran
that thou art one of the messengers of God
sent to shew the right way
This is a revelation of the most mighty, the merciful God
That thou mayest warn a people whose fathers were not warned, and who live in negligence
Our sentence hath justly been pronounced against the greater part of them; wherefore they shall not believe
We have put yokes on their necks, which come up to their chins; and they are forced to hold up their heads
And We have set a bar before them, and a bar behind them; and We have covered them with darkness; wherefore they shall not see
It shall be equal unto them whether thou preach unto them, or do not preach unto them; they shall not believe
But thou shalt preach with effect unto him only who followeth the admonition of the Koran, and feareth the Merciful in secret. Wherefore bear good tidings unto him, of mercy, and an honourable reward
Verily We will restore the dead to life, and will write down their works which they shall have sent before them, and their footsteps which they shall have left behind them; and every thing do We set down in a plain register
Propound unto them as an example the inhabitants of the city of Antioch, when the apostles of Jesus came thereto
When We sent unto them two of the said apostles; but they charged them with imposture. Wherefore We strengthened them with a third. And they said, verily we are sent unto you by God
The inhabitants answered, ye are no other than men, as we are; neither hath the Merciful revealed any thing unto you: Ye only publish a lie
The apostles replied, our Lord knoweth that we are really sent unto you
And our duty is only public preaching
Those of Antioch said, verily we presage evil from you: If ye desist not from preaching, we will surely stone you, and a painful punishment shall be inflicted on you by us
The apostles answered, your evil presage is with yourselves: Although ye be warned, will ye persist in your errors? Verily ye are a people who transgress exceedingly
And a certain man came hastily from the farther parts of the city, and said, O my people, follow the messengers of God
follow him who demandeth not any reward of you: for these are rightly directed
What reason have I that I should not worship Him who hath created me? For unto Him shall ye return
Shall I take other gods besides Him? If the Merciful be pleased to afflict me, their intercession will not avail me at all, neither can they deliver me
Then should I be in a manifest error
Verily I believe in your Lord; wherefore hearken unto me
But they stoned him: And as he died, it was said unto him, enter thou into paradise. And he said, O that my people knew
how merciful God hath been unto me! for he hath highly honoured me
And we sent not down against his people, after they had slain him, an army from heaven, nor the other instruments of destruction which we sent down on unbelievers in former days
There was only one cry of Gabriel from heaven, and behold, they became utterly extinct
O the misery of men! No apostle cometh unto them, but they laugh him to scorn
Do they not consider how many generations we have destroyed before them? Verily they shall not return unto them
But all of them in general shall be assembled before us
One sign of the resurrection unto them is the dead earth: We quicken the same by the rain, and produce thereout various sorts of grain, of which they eat
And We make therein gardens of palm-trees, and vines; and We cause springs to gush forth in the same
That they may eat of the fruits thereof, and of the labour of their hands. Will they not therefore give thanks
Praise be unto Him who hath created all the different kinds, both of vegetables, which the earth bringeth forth, and of their own species, by forming the two sexes, and also the various sorts of things which they know not
The night also is a sign unto them: We withdraw the day from the same, and behold, they are covered with darkness
And the sun hasteneth to his place of rest. This is the disposition of the mighty, the wise God
And for the moon have We appointed certain mansions, until she change and return to be like the old branch of a palm-tree
It is not expedient that the sun should overtake the moon in her course; neither doth the night outstrip the day: But each of these luminaries moveth in a peculiar orbit
It is a sign also unto them, that We carry their offspring in the ship filled with merchandize
and that We have made for them other conveniencies like unto it, whereon they ride
If we please, We drown them, and there is none to help them; neither are they delivered
unless through our mercy, and that they may enjoy life for a season
When it is said unto them, fear that which is before you, and that which is behind you, that ye may obtain mercy; they withdraw from thee
And thou dost not bring them one sign, of the signs of their Lord, but they turn aside from the same
And when it is said unto them, give alms of that which God hath bestowed on you; the unbelievers say unto those who believe, by way of mockery, shall we feed him whom God can feed, if he pleaseth? Verily ye are in no other than a manifest error
And they say, when will this promise of the resurrection be fulfilled, if ye speak truth
They only wait for one sounding of the trumpet, which shall overtake them while they are disputing together
and they shall not have time to make any disposition of their effects, neither shall they return to their family
And the trumpet shall be sounded again; and behold they shall come forth from their graves, and hasten unto their Lord
They shall say, alas for us! Who hath awakened us from our bed? This is what the Merciful promised us; and his apostles spoke the truth
It shall be but one sound of the trumpet, and behold, they shall be all assembled before us
On this day no soul shall be unjustly treated in the least; neither shall ye be rewarded, but according to what ye shall have wrought
On this day the inhabitants of paradise shall be wholly taken up with joy
They and their wives shall rest in shady groves, leaning on magnificent couches
There shall they have fruit, and they shall obtain whatever they shall desire
Peace shall be the word spoken unto the righteous, by a merciful Lord
But He shall say unto the wicked, be ye separated this day, O ye wicked, from the righteous
Did I not command you, O sons of Adam, that ye should not worship Satan; because he was an open enemy unto you
And did I not say, worship Me; this is the right way

Unto whomsoever We grant a long life, him do We cause to bow down his body through age. Will they not therefore understand
We have not taught Mohammed the art of poetry; nor is it expedient for him to be a poet. This book is no other than an admonition from God, and a perspicuous Koran
that he may warn him who is living: And the sentence of condemnation will be justly executed on the unbelievers
Do they not consider that We have created for them, among the things which our hands have wrought, cattle of several kinds, of which they are possessors
and that We have put the same in subjection under them? Some of them are for their riding; and on some of them do they feed
And they receive other advantages therefrom; and of their milk do they drink. Will they not, therefore, be thankful
They have taken other gods, besides God, in hopes that they may be assisted by them
but they are not able to give them any assistance: Yet are they a party of troops ready to defend them
Let not their speech, therefore, grieve thee: We know that which they privately conceal, and that which they publicly discover
Doth not man know that We have created him of seed? Yet behold, he is an open disputer against the resurrection
and he propoundeth unto us a comparison, and forgetteth his creation. He saith, who shall restore bones to life, when they are rotten
Answer, He shall restore them to life, Who produced them the first time: For He is skilled in every kind of creation
Who giveth you fire out of the green tree, and behold, ye kindle your fuel from thence
Is not He who hath created the heavens and the earth, able to create new creatures like unto them? Yea certainly: For He is the wise creator
His command, when He willeth a thing, is only that He saith unto it, be; and it is
Wherefore praise be unto Him, in whose hand is the kingdom of all things, and unto Whom ye shall return at the last day
By the angels, who rank themselves in order
and by those who drive forward and dispel the clouds
and by those who read the Koran for an admonition
verily your God is one
The Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them, and the Lord of the east
We have adorned the lower heaven with the ornament of the stars
And We have placed therein a guard, against every rebellious devil
that they may not listen to the discourse of the exalted princes, -- for they are darted at from every side
to repel them, and a lasting torment is prepared for them
except him who catcheth a word by stealth, and is pursued by a shining flame
Ask the Meccans therefore, whether they be stronger by nature, or the angels whom We have created? We have surely created them of stiff clay
Thou wondrest at God's power and their obstinacy; but they mock at the arguments urged to convince them
When they are warned, they do not take warning
and when they see any sign, they scoff thereat
and say, this is no other than manifest sorcery
After we shall be dead, and become dust and bones, shall we really be raised to life
and our fore-fathers also
Answer, yea: And ye shall then be despicable
There shall be but one blast of the trumpet, and they shall see themselves raised
And they shall say, alas for us! This is the day of judgment
this is the day of distinction between the righteous and the wicked, which ye rejected as a falsehood
Gather together those who have acted unjustly, and their comrades, and the idols which they worshipped
besides God, and direct them in the way to hell
And set them before God's tribunal; for they shall be called to account
What aileth you that ye defend not one another
But on this day they shall submit themselves to the judgment of God
And they shall draw nigh unto one another, and shall dispute among themselves
And the seduced shall say unto those who seduced them, verily ye came unto us with presages of prosperity
and the seducers shall answer, nay, rather ye were not true believers
For we had no power over you to compel you; but ye were people who voluntarily transgressed
Wherefore the sentence of our Lord hath been justly pronounced against us, and we shall surely taste his vengeance
We seduced you; but we also erred ourselves
They shall both thereof be made partakers of the same punishment on that day
Thus will We deal with the wicked
Because when it is said unto them, there is no god besides the true God, they swell with arrogance
and say, shall we abandon our gods for a distracted poet
Nay; he cometh with the truth, and beareth witness to the former apostles
Ye shall surely taste the painful torment of hell
and ye shall not be rewarded, but according to your works
But as for the sincere servants of God
they shall have a certain provision in paradise
namely, delicious fruits: And they shall be honoured
They shall be placed in gardens of pleasure
leaning on couches, opposite to one another
A cup shall be carried round unto them, filled from a limpid fountain
for the delight of those who drink
It shall not oppress the understanding, neither shall they be inebriated therewith
And near them shall lie the virgins of paradise, refraining their looks from beholding any besides their spouses, having large black eyes
and resembling the eggs of an ostrich covered with feathers from the dust
And they shall turn the one unto the other, and shall ask one another questions
And one of them shall say, verily I had an intimate friend while I lived in the world
who said unto me, art thou one of those who assertest the truth of the resurrection
After we shall be dead, and reduced to dust and bones, shall we surely be judged
Then he shall say to his companions, will ye look down
And he shall look down, and shall see him in the midst of hell
And he shall say unto him, by God, it wanted little but thou hadst drawn me into ruin
and had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I had surely been one of those who have been delivered up to eternal torment
Shall we die any other
than our first death; or do we suffer any punishment
Verily this is great felicity
For the obtaining a felicity like this let the labourers labour
Is this a better entertainment, or the tree of Al Zakkum
Verily We have designed the same for an occasion of dispute unto the unjust
It is a tree which issueth from the bottom of hell
The fruit thereof resembleth the heads of devils
and the damned shall eat of the same, and shall fill their bellies therewith
and there shall be given them thereon a mixture of filthy and boiling water to drink
Afterwards shall they return into hell
They found their fathers going astray
and they trod hastily in their footsteps
For the greater part of the ancients erred before them
And We sent warners unto them heretofore
And see how miserable was the end of those who were warned
except the sincere servants of God
Noah called on Us in former days, and We heard him graciously
And We delivered him and his family out of the great distress
and We caused his off-spring to be those who survived to people the earth
And We left the following salutation to be bestowed on him by the latest posterity
namely, peace be on Noah among all creatures
Thus do We reward the righteous
for he was one of our servants the true believers
Afterwards We drowned the others
Abraham also was of his religion
When he came unto his Lord with a perfect heart
When he said unto his father and his people, what do ye worship
Do ye choose false gods preferably to the true God
What therefore is your opinion of the Lord of all creatures
And he looked and observed the stars
and said, verily I shall be sick, and shall not assist at your sacrifices
And they turned their backs and departed from him
And Abraham went privately to their gods, and said scoffingly unto them, do ye not eat of the meat which is set before you
What aileth you that ye speak not
And he turned upon them, and struck them with his right hand, and demolished them
And the people came hastily unto him
And he said, do ye worship the images which ye carve
Whereas God hath created you, and also that which ye make
They said, build a pile for him, and cast him into the glowing fire
And they devised a plot against him; but We made them the inferior, and delivered him
And Abraham said, verily I am going unto my Lord, who will direct me
O Lord, grant me a righteous issue
Wherefore We acquainted him that he should have a son, who should be a meek youth
And when he had attained to years of discretion, and could join in acts of religion with him; Abraham said unto him, O my son, verily I saw in a dream that I should offer thee in sacrifice: Consider therefore what thou art of opinion I should do. He answered, O my father, do what thou art commanded: Thou shalt find me, if God please, a patient person
And when they had submitted themselves to the divine will, and Abraham had laid his son prostrate on his face
We cried unto him, O Abraham
now hast thou verified the vision. Thus do We reward the righteous
Verily this was a manifest trial
And We ransomed him with a noble victim
And We left the following salutation to be bestowed on him by the latest posterity
namely, peace be on Abraham
Thus do We reward the righteous
For he was one of our faithful servants
And We rejoiced him with the promise of Isaac, a righteous prophet
and We blessed him and Isaac: And of their off-spring were some righteous doers, and others who manifestly injured their own souls
We were also gracious unto Moses and Aaron, heretofore
And We delivered them and their people from a great distress
And We assisted them against the Egyptians, and they became the conquerors
And We gave them the perspicuous book of the law
and We directed them into the right way
And We left the following salutation to be bestowed on them by the latest posterity
namely, peace be on Moses and Aaron
Thus do We reward the righteous
for they were two of our faithful servants
And Elias was also one of those who were sent by Us
When he said unto his people, do ye not fear God
Do ye invoke Baal, and forsake the most excellent creator
God is your Lord, and the Lord of your forefathers
But they accused him of imposture: Wherefore they shall be delivered up to eternal punishment
except the sincere servants of God
And We left the following salutation to be bestowed on him by the latest posterity
namely, peace be on Ilyasin
Thus do We reward the righteous
For he was one of our faithful servants
And Lot was also one of those who were sent by Us
When We delivered him and his whole family
except an old woman, his wife, who perished among those that remained behind
Afterwards We destroyed the others
And ye, O people of Mecca, pass by the places where they once dwelt, as ye journey in the morning
and by night: Will ye not therefore understand
Jonas was also one of those who were sent by Us
When he fled into the loaded ship
and those who were on board cast lots among themselves, and he was condemned
And the fish swallowed him; for he was worthy of reprehension
And if he had not been one of those who praised God
verily he had remained in the belly thereof until the day of resurrection
And We cast him on the naked shore, and he was sick
And We caused a plant of a gourd to grow up over him
and We sent him to an hundred thousand persons, or they were a greater number
and they believed: Wherefore We granted them to enjoy this life, for a season
Inquire of the Meccans whether thy Lord hath daughters, and they sons
Have We created the angels of the female sex? And were they witnesses thereof
Do they not say of their own false invention
God hath begotten issue? And are they not really liars
Hath he chosen daughters preferably to sons
Ye have no reason to judge thus
Will ye not therefore be admonished
Or have ye a manifest proof of what ye say
Produce now your book of revelations, if ye speak truth
And they make Him to be of kin unto the genii; whereas the genii know that they who affirm such things, shall be delivered up to eternal punishment
far be that from God, which they affirm of him
Except the sincere servants of God
Moreover ye and that which ye worship
shall not seduce any concerning God
except him who is destined to be burned in hell
There is none of us, but hath an appointed place
We range ourselves in order, attending the commands of God
and we celebrate the divine praise
The infidels said
if we had been favoured with a book of divine revelations, of those which were delivered to the ancients
we had surely been sincere servants of God
Yet now the Koran is revealed, they believe not therein; but hereafter shall they know the consequence of their unbelief
Our word hath formerly been given unto our servants the apostles
that they should certainly be assisted against the infidels
and that our armies should surely be the conquerors
Turn aside therefore from them, for a season
And see the calamities which shall afflict them; for they shall see thy future success and prosperity
Do they therefore seek to hasten our vengeance
Verily when it shall descend into their courts, an evil morning shall it be unto those who were warned in vain
Turn aside from them therefore for a season
and see: Hereafter shall they see thy success and their punishment
Praise be unto thy Lord, the Lord who is far exalted above what they affirm of Him
And peace be on his apostles
And praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
By the Koran full of admonition
Verily the unbelievers are addicted to pride and contention
How many generations have We destroyed before them; and they cried for mercy, but it was not a time to escape
They wonder that a warner from among themselves hath come unto them. And the unbelievers said, this man is a sorcerer, and a liar
Doth he affirm the gods to be but one God? Surely this is a wonderful thing
And the chief men among them departed, saying to one another, go, and persevere in the worship of your gods: Verily this is the thing which is designed
We have not heard any thing like this in the last religion: This is no other than a false contrivance
Hath an admonition been sent unto him preferably to any other among us? Verily they are in a doubt concerning my admonition: But they have not yet tasted my vengeance
Are the treasuries of the mercy of thy Lord, the mighty, the munificent God, in their hands
Is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, and of whatever is between them, in their possession? If it be so, let them ascend by steps unto heaven
But any army of the confederates shall even here be put to flight
The people of Noah, and the tribe of Ad, and Pharaoh the contriver of the stakes
and the tribe of Thamud, and the people of Lot, and the inhabitants of the wood near Madian, accused the prophets of imposture before them: These were the confederates against the messengers of God
All of them did no other than accuse their apostles of falsehood: Wherefore my vengeance hath been justly executed upon them
And these wait only for one sounding of the trumpet; which there shall be no deferring
And they scoffingly say, O Lord, hasten our sentence unto us, before the day of account
Do thou patiently bear that which they utter: And remind them of our servant David, indued with strength; for he was one who seriously turned himself unto God
We compelled the mountains to celebrate our praise with him, in the evening and at sun-rise
and also the birds, which gathered themselves together unto him: All of them returned frequently unto him for this purpose
And We established his kingdom, and gave him wisdom and eloquence of speech
Hath the story of the two adversaries come to thy knowledge; when they ascended over the wall into the upper apartment
when they went in unto David, and he was afraid of them. They said, Fear not: We are two adversaries who have a controversy to be decided. The one of us hath wronged the other: Wherefore judge between us with truth, and be not unjust; and direct us into the even way
This my brother had ninety and nine sheep; and I had only one ewe: And he said, give her me to keep; and he prevailed against me in the discourse which we had together
David answered, verily he hath wronged thee, in demanding thine ewe as an addition to his own sheep: And many of them who are concerned together in business, wrong one another, except those who believe and do that which is right; but how few are they! And David perceived that We had tried him by this parable, and he asked pardon of his Lord: And he fell down and bowed himself, and repented
Wherefore We forgave him this fault; and he shall be admitted to approach near unto us, and shall have an excellent place of abode in paradise
O David, verily We have appointed thee a sovereign prince in the earth: Judge therefore between men with truth; and follow not thy own lust, lest it cause thee to err from the way of God: For those who err from the way of God, shall suffer a severe punishment, because they have forgotten the day of account
We have not created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, in vain. This is the opinion of the unbelievers: But woe unto those who believe not, because of the fire of hell
Shall We deal with those who believe and do good works, as with those who act corruptly in the earth? Shall We deal with the pious as with the wicked
A blessed book have We sent down unto thee, O Mohammed, that they may attentively meditate on the signs thereof, and that men of understanding may be warned
And We gave unto David Solomon; how excellent a servant! For he frequently turned himself unto God
When the horses standing on three feet, and touching the ground with the edge of the fourth foot, and swift in the course, were set in parade before him in the evening
he said, verily I have loved the love of earthly good above the remembrance of my Lord; and have spent the time in viewing these horses, until the sun is hidden by the vail of night
Bring the horses back unto me. And when they were brought back, he began to cut off their legs and their necks
We also tried Solomon, and placed on his throne a counterfeit body: Afterwards he turned unto God
and said, O Lord, forgive me, and give me a kingdom which may not be obtained by any after me; for thou art the giver of kingdoms
And We made the wind subject to him; it ran gently at his command, whithersoever he directed
And We also put the devils in subjection under him; and among them such as were every way skilled in building, and in diving for pearls
And others We delivered to him bound in chains
saying, this is our gift: Therefore be bounteous, or be sparing unto whom thou shalt think fit, without rendering an account
And he shall approach near unto Us, and shall have an excellent abode in paradise
And remember our servant Job; when he cried unto his Lord, saying, verily Satan hath afflicted me with calamity and pain
And it was said unto him, strike the earth with thy foot; which when he had done, a fountain sprang up, and it was said to him, this is for thee to wash in, to refresh thee, and to drink
And We restored unto him his family, and as many more with them, through our mercy; and for an admonition unto those who are indued with understanding
And We said unto him, take a handful of rods in thy hand, and strike thy wife therewith; and break not thine oath. Verily We found him a patient person: How excellent a servant was he! For he was one who frequently turned himself unto Us
Remember also our servants Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, who were men strenuous and prudent
Verily We purified them with a perfect purification, through the remembrance of the life to come
and they were, in our sight, elect and good men
And remember Ismael, and Elisha, and Dhu'lkefl: For all these were good men
This is an admonition. Verily the pious shall have an excellent place to return unto
namely, gardens of perpetual abode, the gates whereof shall stand open unto them
As they lie down therein, they shall there ask for many sorts of fruits, and for drink
and near them shall sit the virgins of paradise, refraining their looks from beholding any besides their spouses, and of equal age with them
This is what ye are promised, at the day of account
This is our provision; which shall not fail
This shall be the reward of the righteous. But for the transgressors is prepared an evil receptacle
namely, hell: They shall be cast into the same to be burned, and a wretched couch shall it be
This let them taste, to wit, scalding water, and corruption flowing from the bodies of the damned
and divers other things of the same kind
And it shall be said to the seducers, this troop which was guided by you, shall be thrown, together with you, headlong into hell: They shall not be bidden welcome; for they shall enter the fire to be burned
And the seduced shall say to their seducers, verily ye shall not be bidden welcome: Ye have brought it upon us; and a wretched abode is hell
They shall say, O Lord, doubly increase the torment of him who hath brought this punishment upon us, in the fire of hell
And the infidels shall say, why do we not see the men whom we numbered among the wicked
and whom we received with scorn? Or do our eyes miss them
Verily this is a truth; to wit, the disputing of the inhabitants of hell fire
Say, O Mohammed, unto the idolaters, verily I am no other than a warner: And there is no god, except the one only God, the Almighty
the Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatsoever is between them; the mighty, the forgiver of sins
Say, it is a weighty message
from which ye turn aside
I had no knowledge of the exalted princes, when they disputed concerning the creation of man
it hath been revealed unto me only as a proof that I am a public preacher
When thy Lord said unto the angels, verily I am about to create man of clay
When I shall have formed him, therefore, and shall have breathed my spirit into him, do ye fall down and worship him
And all the angels worshipped him, in general
except Eblis, who was puffed up with pride, and became an unbeliever
God said unto him, O Eblis, what hindreth thee from worshipping that which I have created with my hands? Art thou elated with vain pride? Or art thou really one of exalted merit
He answered, I am more excellent than he: Thou hast created me of fire, and hast created him of clay
God said unto him, get thee hence therefore, for thou shalt be driven away from mercy
And my curse shall be upon thee, until the day of judgment
He replied, O Lord, respite me, therefore, until the day of resurrection
God said, verily thou shalt be one of those who are respited
until the day of the determined time
Eblis said, by thy might do I swear, I will surely seduce them all
except thy servants who shall be peculiarly chosen from among them
God said, it is a just sentence; and I speak the truth
I will surely fill hell with thee, and with such of them as shall follow thee, altogether
Say unto the Meccans, I ask not of you any reward for this my preaching: Neither am I one of those who assume a part which belongs not to them
The Koran is no other than an admonition unto all creatures
And ye shall surely know what is delivered therein to be true, after a season
The revelation of this book is from the mighty, the wise God
Verily We have revealed this book unto thee with truth: Wherefore serve God, exhibiting the pure religion unto Him
Ought not the pure religion to be exhibited unto God? But as to those who take other patrons besides Him, saying, we worship them only that they may bring us nearer unto God; verily God will judge between them concerning that wherein they disagree. Surely God will not direct him who is a liar, or ungrateful
If God had been minded to have had a son, He had surely chosen what He pleased out of that which He hath created. But far be such a thing from Him! He is the sole, the almighty God
He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth: He causeth the night to succeed the day, and He causeth the day to succeed the night, and He obligeth the sun and the moon to perform their services; each of them hasteneth to an appointed period. Is not He the mighty, the forgiver of sins
He created you of one man, and afterwards out of him formed his wife: And He hath bestowed on you four pair of cattle. He formeth you in the wombs of your mothers, by several gradual formations, within three vails of darkness. This is God your Lord: His is the kingdom: There is no God but He. Why therefore are ye turned aside from the worship of Him to idolatry
If ye be ungrateful, verily God hath no need of you; yet He liketh not ingratitude in his servants: But if ye be thankful, He will be well pleased with you. A burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another: Hereafter shall ye return unto your Lord, and He shall declare unto you that which ye have wrought, and will reward you accordingly; for He knoweth the innermost parts of your breasts
When harm befalleth a man, he calleth upon his Lord, and turneth unto Him: Yet afterwards, when God hath bestowed on him favour from himself, he forgetteth that being which he invoked before, and setteth up equals unto God, that he may seduce men from his way. Say unto such a man, enjoy this life in thy infidelity for a little while: But hereafter shalt thou surely be one of the inhabitants of hell fire
Shall he who giveth himself up to prayer in the hours of the night, prostrate, and standing, and who taketh heed as to the life to come, and hopeth for the mercy of his Lord, be dealt with as the wicked unbeliever? Say, shall they who know their duty, and they who know it not, be held equal? Verily the men of understanding only will be warned
Say, O my servants who believe, fear your Lord. They who do good in this world, shall obtain good in the next; and God's earth is spacious: Verily those who persevere with patience shall receive their recompense without measure
Say, I am commanded to worship God, and to exhibit the pure religion unto him
And I am commanded to be the first Moslem
Say, verily I fear, if I be disobedient unto my Lord, the punishment of the great day
Say, I worship God, exhibiting my religion pure unto Him
But do ye worship that which ye will, besides Him. Say verily they will be the losers, who shall lose their own souls, and their families, on the day of resurrection: Is not this manifest loss
Over them shall be roofs of fire, and under them shall be floors of fire. With this doth God terrify his servants: Wherefore, O my servants, fear me
But those who eschew the worship of idols, and are turned unto God, shall receive good tidings. Bear good tidings therefore unto my servants
who hearken unto my word, and follow that which is most excellent therein: These are they whom God directeth, and these are men of understanding
Him therefore on whom the sentence of eternal punishment shall be justly pronounced, canst thou, O Mohammed, deliver him who is destined to dwell in the fire of hell
But for those who fear their Lord will be prepared high apartments in paradise, over which shall be other apartments built; and rivers shall run beneath them: This is the promise of God; and God will not be contrary to the promise
Dost thou not see that God sendeth down water from heaven, and causeth the same to enter and form sources in the earth; and produceth thereby corn of various sorts? Afterwards He causeth the same to wither; and thou seest it become yellow: Afterwards He maketh it crumble into dust. Verily herein is an instruction to men of understanding
Shall he, therefore, whose breast God hath enlarged to receive the religion of Islam, and who followeth the light from his Lord, be as he whose heart is hardened? But woe unto those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of God! They are in a manifest error
God hath revealed a most excellent discourse; a book conformable to itself, and containing repeated admonitions. The skins of those who fear their Lord shrink for fear thereat: Afterwards their skins grow soft, and their hearts also, at the remembrance of their Lord. This is the direction of God: He will direct thereby whom He pleaseth; and whomsoever God shall cause to err, he shall have no director
Shall he therefore who shall be obliged to screen himself with his face from the severity of the punishment on the day of resurrection, be as he who is secure therefrom? And it shall be said unto the ungodly, taste that which ye have deserved
Those who were before them, accused their apostles of imposture; wherefore a punishment came upon them from whence they expected it not
And God caused them to taste shame in this present life; but the punishment of the life to come will certainly be greater. If they were men of understanding, they would know this
Now have We proposed unto mankind, in this Koran, every kind of parable; that they may be warned
An Arabic Koran, wherein there is no crookedness; that they may fear God
God propoundeth as a parable a man who hath several companions which are at mutual variance, and a man who committeth himself wholly to one person: Shall these be held in equal comparison? God forbid! But the greater part of them do not understand
Verily thou, O Mohammed, shalt die, and they also shall die
And ye shall debate the matter with one another before your Lord, at the day of resurrection
Who is more unjust than he who uttereth a lie concerning God, and denieth the truth, when it cometh unto him? Is there not a dwelling provided in hell for the unbelievers
But he who bringeth the truth, and giveth credit thereto, these are they who fear God
they shall obtain whatever they shall desire, in the sight of their Lord: This shall be the recompense of the righteous
That God may expiate from them the very worst of that which they have wrought, and may render them their reward according to the utmost merit of the good which they have wrought
Is not God a sufficient protector of his servant? Yet they will attempt to make thee afraid of the false deities which they worship besides God. But he whom God shall cause to err, shall have none to direct him
And he whom God shall direct, shall have none to mislead him. Is not God most mighty, able to avenge
If thou ask them who hath created the heavens and the earth, they will surely answer, God. Say, do ye think therefore that the deities which ye invoke besides God, if God be pleased to afflict me, are able to relieve me from his affliction? Or if he be pleased to shew mercy unto me, that they are able to withhold his mercy? Say, God is my sufficient support: In him let those put their trust, who seek in whom to confide
Say, O my people, do ye act according to your state; verily I will act according to mine: Hereafter shall ye know
on which of us will be inflicted a punishment that shall cover him with shame, and on whom a lasting punishment shall fall
Verily We have revealed unto thee the book of the Koran, for the instruction of mankind, with truth. Whoso shall be directed thereby, shall be directed to the advantage of his own soul; and whoso shall err, shall only err against the same: And thou art not a guardian over them
God taketh unto himself the souls of men at the time of their death; and those which die not He also taketh in their sleep: And He withholdeth those on which He hath passed the decree of death, but sendeth back the others till a determined period. Verily herein are signs unto people who consider
Have the Koreish taken idols for their intercessors with God? Say, what, although they have not dominion over any thing, neither do they understand
Say, intercession is altogether in the disposal of God: His is the kingdom of heaven and earth; and hereafter shall ye return unto Him
When the one sole God is mentioned, the hearts of those who believe not in the life to come, shrink with horror: But when the false gods, which are worshipped besides Him, are mentioned, behold, they are filled with joy
Say, O God, the creator of heaven and earth, who knowest that which is secret, and that which is manifest; thou shalt judge between thy servants concerning that wherein they disagree
If those who act unjustly were masters of whatever is in the earth, and as much more therewith, verily they would give it to ransom themselves from the evil of the punishment, on the day of resurrection: And there shall appear unto them, from God, terrors which they never imagined
and there shall appear unto them the evils of that which they shall have gained; and that which they mocked at shall encompass them
When harm befalleth man, he calleth upon Us; yet afterwards, when We have bestowed on him favour from Us, he saith, I have received it merely because of God's knowledge of my deserts. On the contrary, it is a trial; but the greater part of them know it not
Those who were before them, said the same: But that which they had gained, profited them not
and the evils which they had deserved, fell upon them. And whoever of these Meccans shall have acted unjustly, on them likewise shall fall the evils which they shall have deserved; neither shall they frustrate the divine vengeance
Do they not know that God bestoweth provision abundantly on whom He pleaseth, and is sparing unto whom He pleaseth? Verily herein are signs unto people who believe
Say, O my servants who have transgressed against your own souls, despair not of the mercy of God: Seeing that God forgiveth all sins; for He is gracious and merciful
And be turned unto your Lord, and resign yourselves unto Him, before the threatened punishment overtake you; for then ye shall not be helped
And follow the most excellent instructions which have been sent down unto you from your Lord, before the punishment come suddenly upon you, and ye perceive not the approach thereof
and a soul say, alas! For that I have been negligent in my duty to God; verily I have been one of the scorners
Or say, if God had directed me, verily I had been one of the pious
Or say, when it seeth the prepared punishment, if I could return once more into the world, I would become one of the righteous
But God shall answer, my signs came unto thee heretofore, and thou didst charge them with falsehood, and wast puffed up with pride; and thou becamest one of the unbelievers
On the day of resurrection thou shalt see the faces of those who have uttered lies concerning God, become black: Is there not an abode prepared in hell for the arrogant
But God shall deliver those who shall fear Him, and shall set them in their place of safety: Evil shall not touch them, neither shall they be grieved
God is the creator of all things, and He is the governor of all things
His are the keys of heaven and earth: And they who believe not in the signs of God, they shall perish
Say, do ye therefore bid me to worship other than God, O ye fools
Since it hath been spoken by revelation unto thee, and also unto the prophets who have been before thee, saying, verily if thou join any partners with God, thy work will be altogether unprofitable, and thou shalt certainly be one of those who perish
Wherefore rather fear God, and be one of those who give thanks
But they make not a due estimation of God: Since the whole earth shall be but his handful, on the day of resurrection; and the heavens shall be rolled together in his right hand. Praise be unto Him! And far be He exalted above the idols which they associate with Him
The trumpet shall be sounded, and whoever are in heaven, and whoever are on earth shall expire; except those whom God shall please to exempt from the common fate. Afterwards it shall be sounded again; and behold, they shall arise and look up
And the earth shall shine by the light of its Lord: And the book shall be laid open, and the prophets and the martyrs shall be brought as witnesses; and judgment shall be given between them with truth, and they shall not be treated unjustly
And every soul shall be fully rewarded, according to that which it shall have wrought; for He perfectly knoweth whatever they do
And the unbelievers shall be driven unto hell by troops, until, when they shall arrive at the same, the gates thereof shall be opened: And the keepers thereof shall say unto them, did not apostles from among you come unto you, who rehearsed unto you the signs of your Lord, and warned you of the meeting of this your day? They shall answer, yea: But the sentence of eternal punishment hath been justly pronounced on the unbelievers
It shall be said unto them, enter ye the gates of hell, to dwell therein forever; and miserable shall be the abode of the proud
But those who shall have feared their Lord, shall be conducted by troops towards paradise, until they shall arrive at the same: And the gates thereof shall be ready set open; and the guards thereof shall say unto them, peace be on you! Ye have been good: Wherefore enter ye into paradise, to remain therein forever
And they shall answer, praise be unto God, Who hath performed his promise unto us, and hath made us to inherit the earth, that we may dwell in paradise whereever we please! How excellent is the reward of those who work righteousness
And thou shalt see the angels going in procession round the throne, celebrating the praises of their Lord: And judgment shall be given between them with truth; and they shall say, praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
M
The revelation of this book is from the mighty, the wise God
the forgiver of sin, and the accepter of repentance; severe in punishing; long suffering. There is no God but He: Before Him shall be the general assembly at the last day
None disputeth against the signs of God, except the unbelievers: But let not their prosperous dealing in the land deceive thee with vain allurement
The people of Noah, and the confederated infidels which were after them, accused their respective prophets of imposture before these; and each nation hatched ill designs against their apostle, that they might get him into their power; and they disputed with vain reasoning; that they might thereby invalidate the truth: Wherefore I chastised them; and how severe was my punishment
Thus hath the sentence of thy Lord justly passed on the unbelievers; that they shall be the inhabitants of hell fire
The angels who bear the throne of God, and those who stand about it, celebrate the praise of their Lord, and believe in Him; and they ask pardon for the true believers, saying, O Lord, thou encompassest all things by thy mercy and knowledge; wherefore forgive those who repent, and follow thy path, and deliver them from the pains of hell
O Lord, lead them also into gardens of eternal abode, which Thou hast promised unto them, and unto every one who shall do right, of their fathers, and their wives, and their children; for thou art the mighty, the wise God
And deliver them from evil; for whomsoever Thou shalt deliver from evil on that day, on him wilt Thou shew mercy; and this will be great salvation
But the infidels, at the day of judgment, shall hear a voice crying unto them, verily the hatred of God towards you is more grievous than your hatred towards yourselves: Since ye were called unto the faith, and would not believe
They shall say, O Lord, Thou hast given us death twice, and Thou hast twice given us life; and we confess our sins: Is there therefore no way to get forth from this fire
And it shall be answered them, this hath befallen you, for that when one God was preached unto you, ye believed not; but if a plurality of gods had been associated with Him, ye had believed: And judgment belongeth unto the high, the great God
It is He who sheweth you his signs, and sendeth down food unto you from heaven: But none will be admonished, except he who turneth himself unto God
Call therefore upon God, exhibiting your religion pure unto Him, although the infidels be averse thereto
He is the being of exalted degree, the possessor of the throne; who sendeth down the spirit, at his command, on such of his servants as He pleaseth; that He may warn mankind of the day of meeting
the day whereon they shall come forth out of their graves, and nothing of what concerneth them shall be hidden from God. Unto Whom will the kingdom belong, on that day? Unto the only, the almighty God
On that day shall every soul be rewarded according to its merit: There shall be no injustice done on that day. Verily God will be swift in taking an account
Wherefore warn them, O prophet, of the day which shall suddenly approach; when men's hearts shall come up to their throats, and strangle them. The ungodly shall have no friend or intercessor who shall be heard
God will know the deceitful eye, and that which their breasts conceal
and God will judge with truth: But the false gods which they invoke, besides Him, shall not judge at all; for God is He who heareth and seeth
Have they not gone through the earth, and seen what hath been the end of those who were before them? They were more mighty than these in strength, and left more considerable footsteps of their power in the earth: Yet God chastised them for their sins, and there was none to protect them from God
This they suffered, because their apostles had come unto them with evident signs, and they disbelieved: Wherefore God chastised them; for He is strong, and severe in punishing
We heretofore sent Moses with our signs and manifest power
unto Pharaoh, and Haman, and Karoon; and they said, he is a sorcerer, and a liar
And when he came unto them with the truth from Us, they said, slay the sons of those who have believed with him, and save their daughters alive: But the stratagem of the infidels was no other than vain
And Pharaoh said, let me alone, that I may kill Moses; and let him call upon his Lord: Verily I fear lest he change your religion, or cause violence to appear in the earth
And Moses said unto his people, verily I have recourse unto my Lord, and your Lord, to defend me against every proud person, who believeth not in the day of account
And a man who was a true believer, of the family of Pharaoh, and concealed in his faith, said, will ye put a man to death, because he saith, God is my Lord; seeing he is come unto you with evident signs from your Lord? If he be a liar, on him will the punishment of his falsehood light; but if he speaketh the truth, some of those judgments with which he threateneth you, will fall upon you: Verily God directeth not him who is a transgressor, or a liar
O my people, the kingdom is yours this day; and ye are conspicuous in the earth: But who shall defend us from the scourge of God, if it come unto us? Pharaoh said, I only propose to you what I think to be most expedient: And I guide you only into the right path
And he who had believed, said, O my people, verily I fear for you a day like that of the confederates against the prophets in former times
a condition like that of the people of Noah, and the tribes of Ad, and Thamud, and of those who have lived after them: For God willeth not that any injustice be done unto his servants
O my people, verily I fear for you the day whereon men shall call unto one another
the day whereon ye shall be turned back from the tribunal, and driven to hell: Then shall ye have none to protect you against God. And he whom God shall cause to err, shall have no director
Joseph came unto you, before Moses, with evident signs; but ye ceased not to doubt of the religion which he preached unto you, until, when he died, ye said, God will by no means send another apostle, after him. Thus doth God cause him to err, who is a transgressor, and a sceptic
They who dispute against the signs of God, without any authority which hath come unto them, are in great abomination with God, and with those who believe. Thus doth God seal up every proud and stubborn heart
And Pharaoh said, O Haman, build me a tower, that I may reach the tracts
the tracts of heaven, and may view the God of Moses; for I verily think him to be a liar. And thus the evil of his work was prepared for Pharaoh, and he turned aside from the right path: And the stratagems of Pharaoh ended only in loss
And he who had believed, said, O my people, follow me: I will guide you into the right way
O my people, verily this present life is but a temporary enjoyment; but the life to come is the mansion of firm continuance
Whoever worketh evil, shall only be rewarded in equal proportion to the same: But whoever worketh good, whether male or female, and is a true believer, they shall enter paradise; they shall be provided for therein superabundantly
And, O my people, as for me, I invite you to salvation; but ye invite me to hell fire
Ye invite me to deny God, and to associate with him that whereof I have no knowledge; but I invite you to the most mighty, the forgiver of sins
There is no doubt but that the false gods to which ye invite me, deserve not to be invoked, either in this world or in the next; and that we must return unto God; and that the transgressors shall be the inhabitants of hell fire
And ye shall then remember what I now say unto you. And I commit my affair unto God: For God regardeth his servants
Wherefore God delivered him from the evils which they had devised; and a grievous punishment encompassed the people of Pharaoh
They shall be exposed to the fire of hell morning and evening: And the day whereon the hour of judgment shall come, it shall be said unto them, enter O people of Pharaoh, into a most severe torment
And think on the time when the infidels shall dispute together in hell fire; and the weak shall say unto those who behaved with arrogance, verily we were your followers: Will ye, therefore, relieve us from any part of this fire
Those who behaved with arrogance shall answer, verily we are all doomed to suffer therein: For God hath now judged between his servants
And they who shall be in the fire, shall say unto the keepers of hell, call ye on your Lord, that He would ease us, for one day, from this punishment
They shall answer, did not your apostles come unto you with evident proofs? They shall say, yea. The keepers shall reply, do ye therefore call on God: But the calling of the unbelievers on Him shall be only in vain
We will surely assist our apostles, and those who believe, in this present life, and on the day whereon the witnesses shall stand forth
A day, whereon the excuse of the unbelievers shall not avail them; but a curse shall attend them, and a wretched abode
We heretofore gave unto Moses a direction: And We left as an inheritance unto the children of Israel the book of the law
a direction, and an admonition to men of understanding
Wherefore do thou, O prophet, bear the insults of the infidels with patience; for the promise of God is true: And ask pardon for thy fault; and celebrate the praise of thy Lord, in the evening and in the morning
As to those who impugn the signs of God, without any convincing proof which hath been revealed unto them, there is nothing but pride in their breasts; but they shall not attain their desire: Wherefore fly for refuge unto God; for it is He who heareth and seeth
Verily the creation of heaven and earth is more considerable than the creation of man: But the greater part of men do not understand
The blind and the seeing shall not be held equal; nor they who believe and work righteousness, and the evildoer: How few revolve these things in their mind
The last hour will surely come; there is no doubt thereof: But the greater part of men believe it not
Your Lord saith, call upon Me; and I will hear you: But they who proudly disdain my service, shall enter with ignominy into hell
It is God who hath appointed the night for you to take your rest therein, and the day to give you light: Verily God is endued with beneficence towards mankind; but the greater part of men do not give thanks
This is God, your Lord; the creator of all things: There is no God besides Him: How therefore are ye turned aside from his worship
Thus are they turned aside, who oppose the signs of God
It is God who hath given you the earth for a stable floor, and the heaven for a ceiling: And who hath formed you, and made your forms beautiful; and feedeth you with good things. This is God, your Lord. Wherefore blessed be God, the Lord of all creatures
He is the living God: There is no God but He. Wherefore call upon Him, exhibiting unto Him the pure religion. Praise be unto God, the Lord of all creatures
Say, verily I am forbidden to worship the deities which ye invoke, besides God, after that evident proofs have come unto me from my Lord; and I am commanded to resign myself unto the Lord of all creatures
It is He who first created you of dust, and afterwards of seed, and afterwards of coagulated blood; and afterwards brought you forth infants out of your mothers wombs: Then He permitteth you to attain your age of full strength, and afterwards to grow old men, -- but some of you die before that age, -- and to arrive at the determined period of your life; that peradventure ye may understand
It is He who giveth life, and causeth to die: And when He decreeth a thing, He only saith unto it, be, and it is
Dost thou not observe those who dispute against the signs of God, how they are turned aside from the true faith
They who charge with falsehood the book of the Koran, and the other scriptures and revealed doctrines which We sent our former apostles to preach, shall hereafter know their folly
When the collars shall be on their necks, and the chains by which
they shall be dragged into hell: Then shall they be burned in the fire
And it shall be said unto them, where are the gods which ye associated
besides God? They shall answer, they have withdrawn themselves from us: Yea, we called on nothing heretofore. Thus doth God lead the unbelievers into error
This hath befallen you, for that ye rejoiced insolently on earth, in that which was false; and for that ye were elated with immoderate joy
Enter ye the gates of hell, to remain therein for ever: And wretched shall be the abode of the haughty
Wherefore persevere with patience, O Mohammed; for the promise of God is true. Whether We cause thee to see any part of the punishment with which We have threatened them, or whether We cause thee to die before thou see it; before Us shall they be assembled at the last day
We have sent a great number of apostles before thee; the histories of some of whom We have related unto thee, and the histories of others of them We have not related unto thee: But no apostle had the power to produce a sign, unless by the permission of God. When the command of God, therefore, shall come, judgment shall be given with truth; and then shall they perish who endeavour to render the signs of God of no effect
It is God who hath given you the cattle, that ye may ride on some of them, and may eat of others of them
ye also receive other advantages therefrom; -- and that on them ye may arrive at the business proposed in your mind: And on them are ye carried by land, and on ships by sea
And He sheweth you his signs; which, therefore, of the signs of God, will ye deny
Do they not pass through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who were before them? They were more numerous than these, and more mighty in strength, and left more considerable monuments of their power in the earth: Yet that which they had acquired, profited them not
And when their apostles came unto them with evident proofs of their mission, they rejoiced in the knowledge which was with them: But that which they mocked at, encompassed them
And when they beheld our vengeance, they said, we believe in God alone, and we renounce the idols which we associated with Him
But their faith availed them not, after they had beholden our vengeance. This was the ordinance of God, which was formerly observed in respect to his servants: And then did the unbelievers perish
M
This is a revelation from the most Merciful
A book the verses whereof are distinctly explained, an Arabic Koran, for the instruction of people who understand
bearing good tidings, and denouncing threats: But the greater part of them turn aside, and hearken not thereto
And they say, our hearts are veiled from the doctrine to which thou invitest us; and there is a deafness in our ears, and a curtain between us and thee: Wherefore act thou, as thou shalt think fit; for we shall act according to our own sentiments
Say, verily I am only a man like you. It is revealed unto me that your God is one God: Wherefore direct your way strait unto Him; and ask pardon of Him for what is past. And woe be to the idolaters
who give not the appointed alms, and believe not in the life to come
But as to those who believe, and work righteousness; they shall receive an everlasting reward
Say, do ye indeed disbelieve in Him who created the earth in two days; and do ye set up equals unto Him? He is the Lord of all creatures
And He placed in the earth mountains firmly rooted, rising above the same: And He blessed it; and provided therein the food of the creatures designed to be the inhabitants thereof, in four days; equally, for those who ask
Then He set his mind to the creation of heaven; and it was smoke: And He said unto it, and to the earth, come, either obediently, or against your will. They answered, we come, obedient to thy command
And He formed them into seven heavens, in two days; and revealed unto every heaven its office. And We adorned the lower heaven with lights, and placed therein a guard of angels. This is the disposition of the mighty, the wise God
If the Meccans withdraw from these instructions, say, I denounce unto you a sudden destruction, like the destruction of Ad and Thamud
When the apostles came unto them before them and behind them, saying, worship God alone; they answered, if our Lord had been pleased to send messengers, He had surely sent angels: And we believe not the message with which ye are sent
As to the tribe of Ad, they behaved insolently in the earth, without reason, and said, who is more mighty than we in strength? Did they not see that God, who had created them, was more mighty than they in strength? And they knowingly rejected our signs
Wherefore We sent against them a piercing wind, on days of ill luck, that We might make them taste the punishment of shame in this world: But the punishment of the life to come will be more shameful; and they shall not be protected therefrom
And as to Thamud, We directed them; but they loved blindness better than the true direction: Wherefore the terrible noise of an ignominious punishment assailed them, for that which they had deserved
but We delivered those who believed, and feared God
And warn them of the day, on which the enemies of God shall be gathered together unto hell fire, and shall march in distinct bands
until, when they shall arrive thereat their ears, and their eyes, and their skins shall bear witness against them of that which they shall have wrought
And they shall say unto their skins, wherefore do ye bear witness against us? They shall answer, God hath caused us to speak, who giveth speech unto all things: He created you the first time; and unto Him are ye returned
Ye did not hide your selves, while ye sinned, so that your ears, and your eyes, and your skins could not bear witness against you: But ye thought that God was ignorant of many things which ye did
This was your opinion, which ye imagined of your Lord: It hath ruined you; and ye are become lost people
Whether they bear their torment, hell fire shall be their abode; or whether they beg for favour, they shall not obtain favour
And We will give them the devils to be their companions; for they dressed up for them the false notions which they entertained of this present world, and of that which is to come; and the sentence justly fitteth them, which was formerly pronounced on the nations of genii and men who were before them; for they perished
The unbelievers say, hearken not unto this Koran: But use vain discourse during the reading thereof; that ye may overcome the voice of the reader by your scoffs and laughter
Wherefore We will surely cause the unbelievers to taste a grievous punishment, and We will certainly reward them for the evils which they shall have wrought
This shall be the reward of the enemies of God, namely, hell fire; therein is prepared for them an everlasting abode, as a reward for that they have wittingly rejected our signs
And the infidels shall say in hell, O Lord, shew us the two who seduced us, of the genii and men, and we will cast them under our feet, that they may become most base and despicable
As for those who say, our Lord is God, and who behave uprightly; the angels shall descend unto them, and shall say, fear not, neither be ye grieved; but rejoice in the hopes of paradise, which ye have been promised
We are your friends in this life, and in that which is to come: Therein shall ye have that which your souls shall desire, and therein shall ye obtain whatever ye shall ask for
as a gift from a gracious, and merciful God
Who speaketh better than he who inviteth unto God, and worketh righteousness, and saith, I am a Moslem
Good and evil shall not be held equal. Turn away evil with that which is better; and behold, the man between whom and thyself there was enmity, shall become, as it were, thy warmest friend
But none shall attain to this perfection, except they who are patient; nor shall any attain thereto, except he who is indued with a great happiness of temper
And if a malicious suggestion be offered unto thee from Satan, have recourse unto God; for it is He who heareth and knoweth
Among the signs of his power are the night, and the day, and the sun, and the moon. Worship not the sun, neither the moon: But worship God, who hath created them; if ye serve Him
But if they proudly disdain his service; verily the angels, who are with thy Lord, praise Him night and day, and are not wearied
And among his signs another is, that thou seest the land waste: But when we send down rain thereon, it is stirred and fermenteth. And he who quickeneth the earth, will surely quicken the dead; for he is almighty
Verily those who impiously wrong our signs, are not concealed from Us. Is he, therefore, better, who shall be cast into hell fire, or he who shall appear secure on the day of resurrection? Work that which ye will: He certainly beholdeth whatever ye do
Verily they who believe not in the admonition of the Koran, after it hath come unto them, shall one day be discovered. It is certainly a book of infinite value
Vanity shall not approach it, either from before it, or from behind it: It is a revelation from a wise God, whose praise is justly to be celebrated
No other is said unto thee by the infidels of Mecca, than what hath been formerly said, unto the apostles before thee: Verily thy Lord is inclined to forgiveness, and is also able to chastise severely
If We had revealed the Koran in a foreign language, they had surely said, unless the signs thereof be distinctly explained, we will not receive the same: Is the book written in a foreign tongue, and the person unto whom it is directed, an Arabian? Answer, it is, unto those who believe, a sure guide, and a remedy for doubt and uncertainty: But unto those who believe not, it is a thickness of hearing in their ears, and it is a darkness which covereth them; these are as they who are called unto from a distant place
We heretofore gave the book of the law unto Moses; and a dispute arose concerning the same: And if a previous decree had not proceeded from thy Lord, to respite the opposers of that revelation, verily the matter had been decided between them, by the destruction of the infidels; for they were in a very great doubt as to the same
He who doth right, doth it to the advantage of his own soul; and he who doth evil, doth it against the same: For thy Lord is not unjust towards his servants
Unto Him is reserved the knowledge of the hour of judgment: And no fruit cometh forth from the knops which involve it; neither doth any female conceive in her womb, nor is she delivered of her burden, but with his knowledge. On the day whereon He shall call them to Him, saying, where are my companions which ye ascribed unto Me? They shall answer, we assure Thee there is no witness of this matter among us
And the idols which they called on before, shall withdraw themselves from them; and they shall perceive that there will be no way to escape
Man is not wearied with asking good; but if evil befall him, he despondeth, and despaireth
And if We cause him to taste mercy from Us, after affliction hath touched him, he surely saith, this is due to me on account of my deserts: I do not think the hour of judgment will ever come; and if I be brought before my Lord, I shall surely attain, with Him, the most excellent condition. But We will then declare unto those who shall not have believed, that which they have wrought; and We will surely cause them to taste a most severe punishment
When We confer favours on man, he turneth aside, and departeth without returning thanks: But when evil toucheth him, he is frequent at prayer
Say, what think ye? If the Koran be from God, and ye believe not therein; who will lie under a greater error, than he who dissenteth widely therefrom
Hereafter We will shew them our signs in the regions of the earth, and in themselves; until it become manifest unto them that this book is the truth. Is it not sufficient for thee that thy Lord is witness of all things
Are they not in a doubt as to the meeting of their Lord at the resurrection? Doth not He encompass all things
M
K
Thus doth the mighty, the wise God reveal his will unto thee; and in like manner did He reveal it unto the prophets who were before thee
Unto Him belongeth whatever is in heaven, and in earth; and He is the high, the great God
It wanteth little but that the heavens be rent in sunder from above, at the awfulness of his majesty: The angels celebrate the praise of their Lord, and ask pardon for those who dwell in the earth. Is not God the forgiver of sins, the merciful
But as to those who take other gods for their patrons, besides Him, God observeth their actions: For thou art not a steward over them
Thus have We revealed unto thee an Arabic Koran, that thou mayest warn the metropolis of Mecca, and the Arabs who dwell round about it; and mayest threaten them with the day of the general assembly, of which there is no doubt: One part shall then be placed in paradise, and another part in hell
If God had pleased, He had made them all of one religion: But He leadeth whom He pleaseth into his mercy; and the unjust shall have no patron or helper
Do they take other patrons, besides Him? Whereas God is the only true patron: He quickeneth the dead; and He is almighty
Whatever matter ye disagree about, the decision thereof appertaineth unto God. This is God, my Lord: In him do I trust, and unto him do I turn me
the creator of heaven and earth: He hath given you wives of your owns species, and cattle both male and female; by which means He multiplieth you: There is nothing like Him; and it is He who heareth and seeth
His are the keys of heaven and earth: He bestoweth provision abundantly on whom He pleaseth, and He is sparing unto whom He pleaseth; for He knoweth all things
He hath ordained you the religion which He commanded Noah, and which We have revealed unto thee, O Mohammed, and which We commanded Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus: Saying, observe this religion, and be not divided therein. The worship of one God, to which thou invitest them, is grievous unto the unbelievers: God will elect thereto whom He pleaseth, and will direct unto the same him who shall repent
Those who lived in times past were not divided among themselves, until after that the knowledge of God's unity had come unto them; through their own perverseness: And unless a previous decree had passed from thy Lord, to bear with them till a determined time, verily the matter had been decided between them, by the destruction of the gain-sayers. They who have inherited the scriptures after them, are certainly in a perplexing doubt concerning the same
Wherefore invite them to receive the sure faith, and be urgent with them, as thou hast been commanded; and follow not their vain desires: And say, I believe in all the scriptures which God hath sent down; and I am commanded to establish justice among you: God is our Lord, and your Lord: Unto us will our works be imputed, and unto you will your works be imputed: Let there be no wrangling between us and you; for God will assemble us all at the last day, and unto Him shall we return
As to those who dispute concerning God, after obedience hath been paid Him by receiving his religion, their disputing shall be vain in the sight of their Lord; and wrath shall fall on them, and they shall suffer a grievous punishment
It is God who hath sent down the scripture with truth; and the balance of true judgment: And what shall inform thee whether the hour be nigh at hand
They who believe not therein, wish it to be hastened by way of mockery: But they who believe dread the same, and know it to be the truth. Are not those who dispute concerning the last hour in a wide error
God is bounteous unto his servants: He provideth for whom He pleaseth; and He is the strong, the mighty
Whoso chooseth the tillage of the life to come, unto him will We give increase in his tillage: And whoso chooseth the tillage of this world, We will give him the fruit thereof; but he shall have no part in the life to come
Have the idolaters deities which ordain them a religion which God hath not allowed? But had it not been for the decree of respiting their punishment to the day of separating the infidels from the true believers, judgment had been already given between them: For the unjust shall surely suffer a painful torment
On that day thou shalt see the unjust in great terror, because of their demerits; and the penalty thereof shall fall upon them: But they who believe and do good works, shall dwell in the delightful meadows of paradise; they shall obtain whatever they shalt desire, with their Lord. This is the greatest acquisition
This is what God promiseth unto his servants who believe and do good works. Say, I ask not of you, for this my preaching, any reward, except the love of my relations: And whoever shall have deserved well by one good action, unto him will we add the merit of another action thereto; for God is inclined to forgive, and ready to reward
Do they say, Mohammed hath blasphemously forged a lie concerning God? If God pleaseth, he will seal up thy heart: And God will absolutely abolish vanity, and will establish the truth in his words; for He knoweth the innermost parts of men's breasts
It is He who accepteth repentance from his servants, and forgiveth sins, and knoweth that which ye do
He will incline his ear unto those who believe and work righteousness, and will add unto them above what they shall ask or deserve, of his bounty: But the unbelievers shall suffer a severe punishment
If God should bestow abundance upon his servants, they would certainly behave insolently in the earth: But He sendeth down by measure unto every one that which he pleaseth; for He well knoweth and seeth the condition of his servants
It is He who sendeth down the rain, after men have despaired thereof, and spreadeth abroad his mercy; and He is the patron, justly to be praised
Among his signs is the creation of heaven and earth, and of the living creatures with which He hath replenished them both; and He is able to gather them together before his tribunal, whenever He pleaseth
Whatever misfortune befalleth you is sent you by God, for that which your hands have deserved; and yet He forgiveth many things
Ye shall not frustrate the divine vengeance in the earth; neither shall ye have any protector or helper, against God
Among his signs also are the ships running in the sea, like high mountains
If He pleaseth, He causeth the wind to cease, and they lie still on the back of the water: -- verily herein are signs, unto every patient and grateful person
Or He destroyeth them by shipwreck, because of that which their crews have merited; though He pardoneth many things
And they who dispute against our signs, shall know that there will be no way for them to escape our vengeance
Whatever things are given you, they are the provision of this present life: But the reward which is with God is better, and more durable, for those who believe, and put their trust in their Lord
and who avoid hainous and filthy crimes, and when they are angry, forgive
and who hearken unto their Lord, and are constant at prayer, and whose affairs are directed by consultation among themselves, and who give alms out of what We have bestowed on them
and who, when an injury is done them, avenge themselves
And the retaliation of evil ought to be an evil proportionate thereto: -- But he who forgiveth, and is reconciled unto his enemy, shall receive his reward from God; for He loveth not the unjust doers
And whoso shall avenge himself, after he hath been injured; as to these, it is not lawful to punish them for it
But it is only lawful to punish those who wrong men, and act insolently in the earth, against justice; these shall suffer a grievous punishment
And whoso beareth injuries patiently, and forgiveth; verily this is a necessary work
Whom God shall cause to err, he shall afterwards have no protector. And thou shalt see the ungodly, who shall say, when they behold the punishment prepared for them, is there no way to return back into the world
And thou shalt see them exposed unto hell fire; dejected, because of the ignominy they shall undergo: They shall look at the fire sideways, and by stealth; and the true believers shall say, verily the losers are they who have lost their own souls, and their families, on the day of resurrection: Shall not the ungodly continue in eternal torment
They shall have no protectors to defend them against God: And whom God shall cause to err, he shall find no way to the truth
Hearken unto your Lord, before the day come, which God will not keep back: Ye shall have no place of refuge on that day; neither shall ye be able to deny your sins
But if those to whom thou preachest turn aside from thy admonitions, verily We have not sent thee to be a guardian over them: Thy duty is preaching only. When We cause man to taste mercy from Us, he rejoiceth thereat: But if evil befall them, for that which their hands have formerly committed, verily man becometh ungrateful
Unto God appertaineth the kingdom of heaven and earth: He createth that which He pleaseth; He giveth females unto whom He pleaseth, and He giveth males unto whom He pleaseth
or He giveth them males and females jointly: And He maketh whom He pleaseth to be childless; for He is wise, and powerful
It is not fit for man, that God should speak unto him otherwise than by private revelation, or from behind a veil, or by his sending of a messenger to reveal, by his permission, that which He pleaseth; for He is high and wise
Thus have We revealed unto thee a revelation, by our command. Thou didst not understand, before this, what the book of the Koran was, nor what the faith was: But We have ordained the same for a light; We will thereby direct such of our servants as We please: And thou shalt surely direct them into the right way
the way of God, unto whom belongeth whatever is heaven and in earth. Shall not all things return unto God
M
By the perspicuous book
verily We have ordained the same an Arabic Koran, that ye may understand
And it is certainly written in the original book, kept with Us, being sublime and full of wisdom
Shall We therefore turn away from you the admonition, and deprive you thereof, because ye are a people who transgress
And how many prophets have We sent among those of old
And no prophet came unto them, but they laughed him to scorn
Wherefore We destroyed nations who were more mighty than these in strength; and the example of those who were of old, hath been already set before them
If thou ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly answer, the mighty, the wise God created them
Who hath spread the earth as a bed for you, and hath made you paths therein, that ye may be directed
And Who sendeth down rain from heaven by measure, whereby We quicken a dead country; -- so shall ye be brought forth from your graves
And Who hath created all the various species of things, and hath given you ships and cattle, whereon ye are carried
that ye may sit firmly on the backs thereof, and may remember the favour of your Lord, when ye sit thereon, and may say, praise be unto Him, Who hath subjected these unto our service! For we could not have mastered them by our own power
And unto our Lord shall we surely return
Yet have they attributed unto Him some of his servants as his offspring: Verily man is openly ungrateful
Hath God taken daughters out of those beings which He hath created; and hath He chosen sons for you
But when one of them hath the news brought of the birth of a child of that sex which they attribute unto the Merciful, as his similitude, his face becometh black, and he is oppressed with sorrow
Do they therefore attribute unto God female issue, which are brought up among ornaments, and are contentious without cause
And do they make the angels, who are the servants of the Merciful, females? Were they present at their creation? Their testimony shall be written down, and they shall be examined concerning the same, on the day of judgment
And they say, if the Merciful had pleased, we had not worshipped them. They have no knowledge herein: They only utter a vain lie
Have We given them a book of revelations before this; and do they keep the same in their custody
But they say, verily we found our fathers practising a religion; and we are guided in their footsteps
Thus We sent no preacher, before thee, unto any city, but the inhabitants thereof who lived in affluence, said, verily we found our fathers practising a religion: And we tread in their footsteps
And the preacher answered, what, although I bring you a more right religion than that which ye found your fathers to practise? And they replied, verily we believe not that which ye are sent to preach
Wherefore We took vengeance on them: And behold what hath been the end of those who accused our apostles of imposture
Remember when Abraham said unto his father, and his people, verily I am clear of the gods which ye worship
except Him who hath created me; for He will direct me aright

We distribute their nesessary provision among them, in this present life, and We raise some of them several degrees above the others, that the one of them may take the other to serve him: And the mercy of thy Lord is more valuable than the riches which they gather together
If it were not that mankind would have become one sect of infidels, verily We had given unto those who believe not in the Merciful, roofs of silver to their houses, and stairs of silver, by which they might ascend thereto
and doors of silver to their houses, and couches of silver, for them to lean on
and ornaments of gold: For all this is the provision of the present life; but the next life with thy Lord shall be for those who fear Him
Whoever shall withdraw from the admonition of the Merciful, We will chain a devil unto him; and he shall be his inseparable companion
And the devils shall turn them aside from the way of truth; yet they shall imagine themselves to be rightly directed
Until, when he shall appear before us at the last day, he shall say unto the devil, would to God that between me and thee there was the distance of the east from the west! Oh how wretched a companion art thou
But wishes shall not avail you on this day, since ye have been unjust; for ye shall be partakers of the same punishment
Canst thou, O prophet, make the deaf to hear, or canst thou direct the blind, and him who is in a manifest error
Whether We take thee away, We will surely take vengeance on them
or whether We cause thee to see the punishment with which We have threatened them, executed, We will certainly prevail over them
Wherefore hold fast the doctrine which hath been revealed unto thee; for thou art in a right way
And it is a memorial unto thee and thy people, and hereafter shall ye be examined concerning your observance thereof
And ask our apostles whom We have sent before thee, whether We have appointed gods for them to worship, besides the Merciful

although We shewed them no sign, but it was greater than the other: And We inflicted a punishment on them, that peradventure they might be converted
And they said unto Moses, O magician, pray unto thy Lord for us, according to the covenant which He hath made with thee; for we will certainly be directed
But when We took the plague from off them, behold, they brake their promise
And Pharaoh made proclamation among his people, saying, O my people, is not the kingdom of Egypt mine, and these rivers which flow beneath me? Do ye not see

Have bracelets of gold, therefore, been put upon him; or do the angels attend him in orderly procession
And Pharaoh persuaded his people to light behaviour; and they obeyed him: For they were a wicked people
And when they had provoked Us to wrath, We took vengeance on them, and We drowned them all
And We made them a precedent, and an example unto others
And when the son of Mary was proposed for an example; behold, thy people cried out through excess of joy thereat
and they said, are our gods better, or he? They have proposed this instance unto Thee no otherwise than for an occasion of dispute. Yea, they are contentious men
Jesus is no other than a servant, whom We favoured with the gift of prophecy; and We appointed him for an example unto the the children of Israel

O my servants, there shall no fear come on you this day, neither shall ye be grieved
who have believed in our signs, and have been Moslems
Enter ye into paradise, ye and your wives, with great joy
Dishes of gold shall be carried round unto them, and cups without handles: And therein shall they enjoy whatever their souls shall desire, and whatever their eyes shall delight in: And ye shall remain therein for ever
This is paradise, which ye have inherited as a reward for that which ye have wrought
Therein shall ye have fruits in abundance, of which ye shall eat
But the wicked shall remain for ever in the torment of hell
It shall not be made lighter unto them; and they shall despair therein
We deal not unjustly with them, but they deal unjustly with their own souls
And they shall call aloud, saying, O Malec, intercede for us that thy Lord would end us by annihilation. He shall answer, verily ye shall remain here forever
We brought you the truth heretofore, but the greater part of you abhorred the truth
Have the infidels fixed on a method to circumvent our apostle? Verily We will fix on a method to circumvent them
Do they imagine that We hear not their secrets, and their private discourse? Yea; and our messengers who attend them write down the same
Say, if the Merciful had a son, verily I would be the first of those who should worship him
Far be the Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord of the throne, from that which they affirm of him
Wherefore let them wade in their vanity, and divert themselves, until they arrive at their day with which they have been threatened
He who is God in heaven, is God on earth also: And He is the wise, the knowing
And blessed be He unto whom appertaineth the kingdom of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them; with Whom is the knowledge of the last hour; and before Whom ye shall be assembled
They whom they invoke besides Him, have not the privilege to intercede for others; except those who bear witness to the truth, and know the same
If thou ask them who hath created them, they will surely answer, God. How therefore are they turned away to the worship of others? God also heareth
the saying of the prophet, O Lord, verily these are people who believe not
And He answereth, therefore turn aside from them; and say, peace: Hereafter shall they know their folly
M
By the perspicuous book of the Koran
verily We have sent down the same on a blessed night, -- for We had engaged so to do
on the night wherein is distinctly sent down the decree of every determined thing, as a command from Us
Verily We have ever used to send apostles with revelations, at proper intervals
as a mercy from thy Lord; for it is He who heareth and knoweth
The Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them; if ye are men of sure knowledge
There is no God but He: He giveth life, and He causeth to die; he is your Lord, and the Lord of your fore-fathers
Yet do they amuse themselves with doubt
But observe them on the day whereon the heaven shall produce a visible smoke
which shall cover mankind: This will be a tormenting plague
They shall say, O Lord, take this plague from off us: Verily we will become true believers
How should an admonition be of avail to them in this condition; when a manifest apostle came unto them
but they retired from him, saying, this man is instructed by others, or is a distracted person
We will take the plague from off you, a little: But ye will certainly return to your infidelity

How many gardens, and fountains
and fields of corn, and fair dwellings
and advantages which they enjoyed, did they leave behind them
Thus We dispossessed them thereof; and We gave the same for an inheritance unto another people
Neither heaven nor earth wept for them; neither were they respited any longer
And We delivered the children of Israel from a shameful affliction
from Pharaoh; for he was haughty, and a transgressor
And We chose them, knowingly, above all people
and We shewed them several signs, wherein was an evident trial
Verily these Meccans say
assuredly our final end will be no other than our first natural death; neither shall we be raised again
Bring now our forefathers back to life, if ye speak truth
Are they better, or the people of Tobba, and those who were before them? We destroyed them, because they wrought wickedness
We have not created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, by way of sport
We have created them no otherwise than in truth; but the greater part of them do not understand

a day, whereon the master and the servant shall be of no advantage to one another, neither shall they be helped
excepting those on whom God shall have mercy: For He is the mighty, the merciful
Verily the fruit of the tree of al Zakkum
shall be the food of the impious
As the dregs of oil shall it boil in the bellies of the damned
like the boiling of the hottest water
And it shall be said to the tormentors, take him, and drag him into the midst of hell
And pour on his head the torture of boiling water
saying, taste this; for thou art that mighty and honourable person
Verily this is the punishment of which ye doubted
But the pious shall be lodged in a place of security
among gardens and fountains
They shall be cloathed in fine silk, and in satin; and they shall sit facing one another
Thus shall it be: And We will espouse them to fair damsels, having large black eyes
In that place shall they call for all kinds of fruits, in full security
They shall not taste death therein, after the first death; and God shall deliver from the pains of hell
Through the gracious bounty of thy Lord. This will be great felicity
Moreover We have rendered the Koran easy for thee, by revealing it in thine own tongue: To the end that they may be admonished
Wherefore do thou wait the event; for they wait to see some misfortune befall thee
M
The revelation of this book is from the mighty, the wise God
Verily both in heaven and earth are signs of the divine power unto the true believers
And in the creation of yourselves, and of the beasts which are scattered over the face of the earth, are signs unto people of sound judgment
and also in the vicissitude of night and day, and the rain which God sendeth down from heaven, whereby He quickeneth the earth after it hath been dead: In the change of the winds also are signs, unto people of understanding
These are the signs of God; We rehearse them unto thee with truth. In what revelation therefore will they believe, after they have rejected God and his signs
Woe unto every lying, and impious person
who heareth the signs of God, which are read unto him, and afterwards proudly persisteth in infidelity, as though he heard them not: -- Denounce unto him a painful punishment
And who, when he cometh to the knowledge of any of our signs, receiveth the same with scorn. For these is prepared a shameful punishment
Before them lieth hell; and whatever they shall have gained shall not avail them at all, neither shall the idols which they have taken for their patrons, besides God: And they shall suffer a grievous punishment
This is a true direction; And for those who disbelieve the signs of their Lord, is prepared the punishment of a painful torment
It is God who hath subjected the sea unto you, that the ships may sail therein, at his command; and that ye may seek advantage unto yourselves by commerce, of his bounty; and that ye may give thanks
And He obligeth whatever is in heaven and on earth to serve you; the whole being from Him. Verily herein are signs, unto people who consider
Speak unto the true believers, that they forgive those who hope not for the days of God, that He may reward people according to what they shall have wrought
Whoso doth that which is right, doth it to the advantage of his own soul; and whoso doth evil, doth it against the same: Hereafter shall ye return unto your Lord
We gave unto the children of Israel the book of the law, and wisdom, and prophecy; and We fed them with good things, and preferred them above all nations
And We gave them plain ordinances concerning the business of religion; neither did they fall to variance, except after that knowledge had come unto them, through envy amongst themselves: But thy Lord will decide the controversy between them, on the day of resurrection, concerning that wherein they disagree
Afterwards We appointed thee, O Mohammed, to promulgate a law concerning the business of religion: Wherefore follow the same, and follow not the desires of those who are ignorant
Verily they shall not avail thee against God at all: The unjust are the patrons of one another; but God is the patron of the pious
This Koran delivereth evident precepts unto mankind; and is a direction, and a mercy, unto people who judge aright
Do the workers of iniquity imagine that We will deal with them as with those who believe and do good works; so that their life and their death shall be equal? An ill judgment do they make
God hath created the heavens and the earth in truth; that He may recompense every soul according to that which it shall have wrought: And they shall not be treated unjustly
What thinkest thou? He who taketh his own lust for his God, and whom God causeth knowingly to err, and whose ears, and whose heart He hath sealed up, and over whose eyes He hath cast a veil; who shall direct him, after God shall have forsaken him? Will ye not therefore be admonished
They say, there is no other life, except our present life: We die, and we live; and nothing but time destroyeth us. But they have no knowledge in this matter; they only follow a vain opinion
And when our evident signs are rehearsed unto them, their argument which they offer against the same, is no other than that they say, bring to life our fathers who have been dead; if ye speak truth
Say, God giveth you life; and afterwards causeth you to die: Hereafter will He assemble you together on the day of resurrection; there is no doubt thereof; but the greater part of men do not understand
Unto God appertaineth the kingdom of heaven and earth; and the day whereon the hour shall be fixed, on that day shall those who charge the Koran with vanity perish
And thou shalt see every nation kneeling: Every nation shall be called unto its book of account; and it shall be said unto them, this day shall ye be rewarded according to that which ye have wrought
This our book will speak concerning you with truth: Therein have we written down whatever ye have done
As to those who shall have believed and done good works, their Lord shall lead them into his mercy: This shall be manifest felicity
But as to the infidels, it shall be said unto them, Were not my signs rehearsed unto you? But ye proudly rejected them, and became a wicked people
And when it was said unto you, verily the promise of God is true; and as to the hour of judgment, there is no doubt thereof: Ye answered, we know not what the hour of judgment is: We hold an uncertain opinion only; and we are not well assured of this matter
But on that day the evils of that which they have wrought, shall appear unto them; and that which they mocked at, shall encompass them
And it shall be said unto them, this day will We forget you, as ye did forget the meeting of this your day: And your abode shall be hell fire; and ye shall have none to deliver you
This shall ye suffer, because ye turned the signs of God to ridicule; and the life of the world deceived you. On this day, therefore, they shall not be taken forth from thence, neither shall they be asked any more to render themselves well-pleasing unto God
Wherefore praise be unto God, the Lord of the heavens, and the Lord of the earth; the Lord of all creatures
And unto Him be glory in heaven and earth; for He is the mighty, the wise God
M
The revelation of this book is from the mighty, the wise God
We have not created the heavens, and the earth, and whatever is between them, otherwise than in truth, and for a determined period: But the unbelievers turn away from the warning which is given them
Say, what think ye? Shew me what part of the earth the idols which ye invoke, besides God, have created? Or had they any share in the creation of the heavens? Bring Me a book of scripture revealed before this, or some footstep of ancient knowledge, to countenance your idolatrous practices; if ye are men of veracity
Who is in a wider error than he who invoketh, besides God, that which cannot return him an answer, to the day of resurrection; and idols which regard not their calling on them
And which, when men shall be gathered together to judgment, will become their enemies, and will ungratefully deny their worship
When our evident signs are rehearsed unto them, the unbelievers say of the truth, when it cometh unto them, this is a manifest piece of sorcery
Will they say, Mohammed hath forged it? Answer, if I have forged it, verily ye shall not obtain for me any favour from God: He well knoweth the injurious language which ye utter concerning it: He is a sufficient witness between me and you; and He is gracious and merciful
Say, I am not singular among the apostles; neither do I know what will be done with me or with you hereafter: I follow no other than what is revealed unto me; neither am I any more than a public warner
Say, what is your opinion? If this book be from God, and ye believe not therein; and a witness of the children of Israel bear witness to its consonancy with the law, and believeth therein; and ye proudly reject the same: Are ye not unjust doers? Verily God directeth not unjust people
But those who believe not, say of the true believers, if the doctrine of the Koran had been good, they had not embraced the same before us. And when they are not guided thereby, they say, this is an antiquated lie
Whereas the book of Moses was revealed before the Koran, to be a guide and a mercy: And this is a book confirming the same, delivered, in the Arabic tongue; to denounce threats unto those who act unjustly, and to bear good tidings unto the righteous doers
As to those who say, our Lord is God; and who behave uprightly: On them shall no fear come, neither shall they be grieved
These shall be the inhabitants of paradise, they shall remain therein for ever: In recompense for that which they have wrought
We have commanded man to shew kindness to his parents: His mother beareth him in her womb with pain, and bringeth him forth with pain: And the space of his being carried in her womb, and of his weaning, is thirty months; until, when he attaineth his age of strength, and attaineth the age of forty years, he saith, O Lord, excite me, by thy inspiration, that I may be grateful for thy favours, wherewith thou hast favoured me and my parents; and that I may work righteousness, which may please thee: And be gracious unto me in my issue; for I am turned unto thee, and am a Moslem
These are they from whom We accept the good work which they have wrought, and whose evil works We pass by; and they shall be among the inhabitants of paradise: This is a true promise, which they are promised in this world
He who saith unto his parents, fie on you! Do ye promise me that I shall be taken forth from the grave, and restored to life; when many generations have passed away before me, and none of them have returned back? And his parents implore God's assistance, and say to their son, alas for thee! Believe: For the promise of God is true. But he answereth, this is no other than silly fables of the ancients
These are they whom the sentence passed on the nations which have been before them, of genii and of men, justly fitteth: They shall surely perish
For every one is prepared a certain degree of happiness or misery, according to that which they shall have wrought; that God may recompense them for their works: And they shall not be treated unjustly
On a certain day, the unbelievers shall be exposed before the fire of hell; and it shall be said unto them, ye received your good things in your life-time, while ye were in the world; and ye enjoyed yourselves therein: Wherefore this day ye shall be rewarded with the punishment of ignominy; for that ye behaved insolently in the earth, without justice, and for that ye transgressed
Remember the brother of Ad, when he preached unto his people in al Ahkaf, -- and there were preachers before him, and after him, -- saying, worship none but God: Verily I fear for you the punishment of a great day
They answered, art thou come unto us that thou mayest turn us aside from the worship of our gods? Bring on us now the punishment with which thou threatenest us, if thou art a man of veracity
He said, verily the knowledge of the time when your punishment will be inflicted, is with God; and I only declare unto you that which I am sent to preach; but I see ye are an ignorant people
And when they saw the preparation made for their punishment, namely, a cloud traversing the sky, and tending towards their valleys, they said, this is a traversing cloud, which bringeth us rain. Hud answered, nay; it is what ye demanded to be hastened: A wind, wherein is a severe vengeance
It will destroy every thing, at the command of its Lord. And in the morning nothing was to be seen, besides their empty dwellings. Thus do We reward wicked people
We had established them in the like flourishing condition wherein We have established you, O men of Mecca; and We had given them ears, and eyes, and hearts: Yet neither their ears, nor their eyes, nor their hearts profited them at all, when they rejected the signs of God; but the vengeance which they mocked at, fell upon them
We heretofore destroyed the cities which were round about you; and We variously proposed our signs unto them, that they might repent
Did those protect them, whom they took for gods, besides God, and imagined to be honoured with his familiarity? Nay; they withdrew from them: Yet this was their false opinion which seduced them, and the blasphemy which they had devised
Remember when We caused certain of the genii to turn aside unto thee, that they might hear the Koran: And when they were present at the reading of the same, they said to one another, give ear: And when it was ended, they returned back unto their people, preaching what they had heard
They said our people, verily we have heard a book read unto us, which hath been revealed since Moses, confirming the scripture which was delivered before it; and directing unto the truth, and the right way
Our people, obey God's preacher: And believe in him; that he may forgive you your sins, and may deliver you from a painful punishment
And whoever obeyeth not God's preacher, shall by no means frustrate God's vengeance on earth: neither shall he have any protectors besides Him. These will be in a manifest error
Do they not know that God, Who hath created the heavens and the earth, and was not fatigued with the creation thereof, is able to raise the dead to life? Yea verily: For He is almighty
On a certain day the unbelievers shall be exposed unto hell fire; and it shall be said unto them, is not this really come to pass? They shall answer, yea, by our Lord. God shall reply, taste, therefore, the punishment of hell, for that ye have been unbelievers
Do thou, O prophet, bear the insults of thy people with patience, as our apostles, who were endued with constancy, bare the injuries of their people: And require not their punishment to be hastened unto them. On the day whereon they shall see the punishment wherewith they have been threatened, it shall seem as though they had tarried in the world but an hour of a day. This is a fair warning. Shall any perish except the people who transgress
God will render of none effect the works of those who believe not, and who turn away men from the way of God
But as to those who believe, and work righteousness, and believe in the revelation which hath been sent down unto Mohammed, -- for it is the truth from their Lord, -- He will expiate their evil deeds from them, and will dispose their heart aright
This will He do, because those who believe not follow vanity, and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus God propoundeth unto men their examples
When ye encounter the unbelievers, strike off their heads, until ye have made a great slaughter among them; and bind them in bonds: And either give them a free dismission afterwards, or exact a ransom; until the war shall have laid down its arms. This shall ye do: Verily if God pleased, He could take vengeance on them, without your assistance; but He commandeth you to fight his battles, that He may prove the one of you by the other. And as to those who fight in defence of God's true religion, God will not suffer their works to perish
He will guide them, and will dispose their heart aright
and He will lead them into paradise, of which He hath told them
O true believers, if ye assist God, by fighting for his religion, He will assist you against your enemies; and will set your feet fast
But as for the infidels, let them perish; and their works shall God render vain
This shall befall them, because they have rejected with abhorrence that which God hath revealed: Wherefore their works shall become of no avail
Do they not travel through the earth, and see what hath been the end of those who were before them? God utterly destroyed them: And the like catastrophe awaiteth the unbelievers
This shall come to pass, for that God is the patron of the true believers, and for that the infidels have no protector
Verily God will introduce those who believe, and do good works, into gardens beneath which rivers flow: But the unbelievers indulge themselves in pleasures, and eat as beasts eat; and their abode shall be hell fire
How many cities were more mighty in strength than thy city which hath expelled thee; yet have We destroyed them, and there was none to help them
Shall he, therefore, who followeth the plain declaration of his Lord, be as he whose evil works have been dressed up for him by the devil; and who follow their own lusts
The description of paradise, which is promised unto the pious: Therein are rivers of incorruptible water; and rivers of milk, the taste whereof changeth not; and rivers of wine, pleasant unto those who drink; and rivers of clarified honey: And therein shall they have plenty of all kinds of fruits; and pardon from their Lord. Shall the man for whom these things are prepared, be as he who must dwell for ever in hell fire; and will have the boiling water given them to drink, which shall burst their bowels
Of the unbelievers there are some who give ear unto thee, until, when they go out from thee, they say, by way of derision, unto those to whom knowledge hath been given, what hath he said now? These are they whose hearts God hath sealed up, and who follow their own lusts
But as to those who are directed, God will grant them a more ample direction, and He will instruct them what to avoid
Do the infidels wait for any other than the last hour, that it may come upon them suddenly? Some signs thereof are already come: And when it shall actually overtake them, how can they then receive admonition
Know, therefore, that there is no god but God: And ask pardon for thy sin, and for the true believers both men and women. God knoweth your busy employment in the world, and the place of your abode hereafter
The true believers say, hath not a sura been revealed commanding war against the infidels? But when a sura without any ambiguity is revealed, and war is mentioned therein, thou mayest see those in whose hearts is an infirmity, look towards thee with the look of one whom death overshadoweth
But obedience would be more eligible for them, and to speak that which is convenient. And when the command is firmly established, if they give credit unto God, it will be better for them
Were ye ready therefore, if ye had been put in authority, to commit outrages in the earth, and to violate your ties of blood
These are they whom God hath cursed, and hath rendered deaf, and whose eyes He hath blinded
Do they not therefore attentively meditate on the Koran? Are there locks upon their hearts
Verily they who turn their backs, after the true direction is made manifest unto them; Satan shall prepare their wickedness for them, and God shall bear with them for a time
This shall befall them, because they say privately unto those who detest what God hath revealed, we will obey you in part of the matter. But God knoweth their secrets
How therefore will it be with them, when the angels shall cause them to die, and shall strike their faces, and their backs
This shall they suffer, because they follow that which provoketh God to wrath, and are averse to what is well pleasing unto Him: And He will render their works vain
Do they in whose hearts is an infirmity, imagine that God will not bring their malice to light
If We pleased, We could surely shew them unto thee, and thou shouldest know them by their marks; but thou shalt certainly know them by their perverse pronunciation of their words. God knoweth your actions
And We will try you, until We know those among you who fight valiantly, and who persevere with constancy; and We will try the reports of your behaviour
Verily those who believe not, and turn away men from the way of God, and make opposition against the apostle, after the divine direction hath been manifested unto them, shall not hurt God at all; but He shall make their works to perish
O true believers, obey God; and obey the apostle: And render not your works of no effect
Verily those who believe not, and who turn away men from the way of God, and then die, being unbelievers, God will by no means forgive
Faint not therefore, neither invite your enemies to peace, while ye are the superior: For God is with you, and will not defraud you of the merit of your works
Verily this present life is only a play and a vain amusement: But if ye believe, and fear God, He will give you your rewards. He doth not require of you your whole substance
If He should require the whole of you, and earnestly press you, ye would become niggardly, and it would raise your hatred against his apostle
Behold, ye are those who are invited to expend part of your substance for the support of God's true religion; and there are some of you who are niggardly. But whoever shall be niggardly, shall be niggardly towards his own soul: For God wanteth nothing, but ye are needy: And if ye turn back, He will substitute another people in your stead, who shall not be like unto you
Verily We have granted thee a manifest victory
That God may forgive thee thy preceding and thy subsequent sin, and may complete his favour on thee, and direct thee in the right way
and that God may assist thee with a glorious assistance
It is He who sendeth down secure tranquillity into the hearts of the true believers, that they may increase in faith, beyond their former faith: -- The hosts of heaven and earth are God's; and God is knowing and wise
That He may lead the true believers of both sexes into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever; and may expiate their evil deeds from them: -- This will be great felicity with God
And that He may punish the hypocritical men, and the hypocritical women, and the idolaters, and the idolatresses, who conceive an ill opinion of God. They shall experience a turn of evil fortune; and God shall be angry with them, and shall curse them, and hath prepared hell for them; an ill journey shall it be thither
Unto God belong the hosts of heaven and earth; and God is mighty and wise
Verily We have sent thee to be a witness and a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats
that ye may believe in God, and his apostle; and may assist Him, and revere Him, and praise Him morning and evening
Verily they who swear fealty unto thee, swear fealty unto God: The hand of God is over their hands. Whoever shall violate his oath, will violate the same to the hurt only of his own soul: But whoever shall perform that which he hath covenanted with God, He will surely give him a great reward
The Arabs of the desert who were left behind will say unto thee, our substance and our families employed us, so that we went not forth with thee to war; wherefore ask pardon for us. They speak that with their tongues, which is not in their hearts. Answer, who shall be able to obtain for you any thing from God to the contrary, if he is pleased to afflict you, or is pleased to be gracious unto you? Yea verily, God is well acquainted with that which ye do
Truly ye imagined that the apostle and the true believers would never return to their families; and this was prepared in your hearts: But ye imagined an evil imagination; and ye are a corrupt people
Whoso believeth not in God and his apostle, verily We have prepared burning fire for the unbelievers
Unto God belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth: He forgiveth whom He pleaseth, and He punisheth whom He pleaseth; and God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
Those who were left behind will say, when ye go forth to take the spoil, suffer us to follow you. They seek to change the word of God. Say, ye shall by no means follow us: Thus hath God said heretofore. They will reply, nay; ye envy us a share of the booty. But they are men of small understanding
Say unto the Arabs of the desert who were left behind, ye shall be called forth against a mighty and a warlike nation: Ye shall fight against them, or they shall profess Islam. If ye obey, God will give you a glorious reward: But if ye turn back, as ye turned back heretofore, He will chastise you with a grievous chastisement
It shall be no crime in the blind, neither shall it be a crime in the lame, neither shall it be a crime in the sick, if they go not forth to war: And whoso shall obey God and his apostle, he shall lead him into gardens beneath which rivers flow; but whoso shall turn back, He will chastise him with a grievous chastisement
Now God was well pleased with the true believers, when they sware fidelity unto thee under the tree; and He knew that which was in their hearts: Wherefore He sent down on them tranquillity of mind, and rewarded them with a speedy victory
and many spoils which they took: For God is mighty and wise
God promised you many spoils which ye should take; but He gave you these by way of earnest: And He restrained the hands of men from you: That the same may be a sign unto the true believers; and that He may guide you into the right way
And He also promiseth you other spoils, which ye have not yet been able to take: But now hath God encompassed them for you; and God is almighty
If the unbelieving Meccans had fought against you, verily they had turned their backs; and they would not have found a patron or protector
According to the ordinance of God, which hath been put in execution heretofore against opposers of the prophets; for thou shalt not find any change in the ordinance of God
It was He who restrained their hands from you, and your hands from them, in the valley of Mecca; after that He had given you the victory over them: And God saw that which ye did
These are they who believed not, and hindered you from visiting the holy temple, and also hindered the offering, being detained, that it should not arrive at the place where it ought to be sacrificed. Had it not been that ye might have trampled on divers true believers, both men and women, whom ye knew not, being promiscuously assembled with the infidels, and that a crime might therefore have lighted on you on their account, without your knowledge, He had not restrained your hands from them: But this was done, that God might lead whom He pleaseth into his mercy. If they had been distinguished from one another, we had surely chastised such of them as believed not, with a severe chastisement
When the unbelievers had put in their hearts an affected preciseness, the preciseness of ignorance, and God sent down his tranquillity on his apostle and on the true believers; and firmly fixed in them the word of piety, and they were the most worthy of the same, and the most deserving thereof: For God knoweth all things
Now hath God in truth verified unto his apostle the vision, wherein He said; ye shall surely enter the holy temple of Mecca, if God please, in full security; having your heads shaved, and your hair cut: Ye shall not fear: For God knoweth that which ye know not; and He hath appointed you, besides this, a speedy victory
It is He who hath sent his apostle with the direction, and the religion of truth; that He may exalt the same above every religion: And God is a sufficient witness hereof
Mohammed is the apostle of God: And those who are with him are fierce against the unbelievers, but compassionate towards one another. Thou mayest see them bowing down, prostrate, seeking a recompense from God, and his good will. Their signs are in their faces, being marks of frequent prostration. This is their description in the pentateuch, and their description in the gospel: They are as seed which putteth forth its stalk, and strengtheneth it, and swelleth in the ear, and riseth upon its stem; giving delight unto the sower. Such are the Moslems described to be: That the infidels may swell with indignation at them. God hath promised unto such of them as believe, and do good works, pardon and a great reward
O true believers, anticipate not any matter in the sight of God and his apostle: And fear God; for God both heareth and knoweth
O true believers, raise not your voices above the voice of the prophet; neither speak loud unto him in discourse, as ye speak loud unto one another, lest your works become vain, and ye perceive it not
Verily they who lower their voices in the presence of the apostle of God, are those whose hearts God hath disposed unto piety: They shall obtain pardon, and a great reward
As to those who call unto thee from without the inner apartments, the greater part of them do not understand the respect due to thee
If they wait with patience, until thou come forth unto them, it will certainly be better for them: But God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
O true believers, if a wicked man come unto you with a tale, inquire strictly into the truth thereof; lest ye hurt people through ignorance, and afterwards repent of what ye have done
And know that the apostle of God is among you: If he should obey you in many things, ye would certainly be guilty of a crime, in leading him into a mistake. But God hath made the faith amiable unto you, and hath prepared the same in your hearts; and hath rendered infidelity, and iniquity, and disobedience hateful unto you. These are they who walk in the right way
through mercy from God, and grace: And God is knowing, and wise
If two parties of the believers contend with one another, do ye endavour to compose the matter between them: And if the one of them offer an insult unto the other, fight against that party which offered the insult, until they return unto the judgment of God; and if they do return, make peace between them with equity: And act with justice; for God loveth those who act justly
Verily the true believers are brethren: Wherefore reconcile your brethren; and fear God, that ye may obtain mercy
O true believers, let not men laugh other men to scorn; who peradventure may be better than themselves: Neither let women laugh other women to scorn; who may possibly be better than themselves. Neither defame one another; nor call one another by opprobrious appellations. An ill name it is to be charged with wickedness, after having embraced the faith: And whoso repenteth not, they will be the unjust doers
O true believers, carefully avoid entertaining a suspicion of another: For some suspicions are a crime. Inquire not too curiously into other mens failings: Neither let the one of you speak ill of another in his abscence. Would any of you desire to eat the flesh of his dead brother? Surely ye would abhor it. And fear God: For God is easy to be reconciled, and merciful
O men, verily We have created you of a male and a female; and We have distributed you into nations, and tribes, that ye might know one another. Verily the most honourable of you, in the sight of God, is the most pious of you: And God is wise and knowing
The Arabs of the desert say, we believe. Answer, ye do by no means believe; but say, we have embraced Islam: For the faith hath not yet entered into your hearts. If ye obey God and his apostle, He will not defraud you of any part of the merit of your works: For God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
Verily the true believers are those only who believe in God and his apostle, and afterwards doubt not; and who employ their substance and their persons in the defence of God's true religion: These are they who speak sincerely
Say, will ye inform God concerning your religion? But God knoweth whatever is in heaven and in earth: For God is omniscient
They upbraid thee that they have embraced Islam. Answer, upbraid me not with your having embraced Islam: Rather God upbraideth you, that He hath directed you to the faith; if ye speak sincerely
Verily God knoweth the secrets of heaven and earth: And God beholdeth that which ye do
By the glorious Koran
Verily they wonder that a preacher from among themselves is come unto them; and the unbelievers say, this is a wonderful thing
After we shall be dead, and become dust, shall we return to life? This is a return remote from thought
Now We know what the earth consumeth of them; and with Us is a book which keepeth an account thereof
But they charge falsehood on the truth, after it hath come unto them: Wherefore they are plunged in a confused business
Do they not look up to the heaven above them, and consider how We have raised it and adorned it; and that there are no flaws therein
We have also spread forth the earth, and thrown thereon mountains firmly rooted: And We cause every beautiful kind of vegetables to spring up therein
for a subject of meditation, and an admonition unto every man who turneth unto Us
And We send down rain as a blessing from heaven, whereby We cause gardens to spring forth, and the grain of harvest
and tall palm-trees having branches laden with dates hanging one above another
as a provision for mankind; and We thereby quicken a dead country: So shall be the coming forth of the dead from their graves
The people of Noah, and those who dwelt at Al Rass, and Thamud, and Ad, and Pharaoh accused the prophets of imposture before the Meccans
and also the brethren of Lot
and the inhabitants of the wood near Midian, and the people of Tobba: All these accused the apostles of imposture; wherefore the judgments which I threatened were justly inflicted on them
Is our power exhausted by the first creation? Yea; they are in a perplexity, because of a new creation which is foretold them, namely, the raising of the dead
We created man, and We know what his soul whispereth within him; and We are nearer unto him than his jugular vein
When the two angels deputed to take account of a man's behaviour, take an account thereof; one sitting on the right hand, and the other on the left
He uttereth not a word, but there is with him a watcher, ready to note it
And the agony of death shall come in truth: This, O man, is what thou soughtest to avoid
And the trumpet shall sound: This will be the day which hath been threatened
And every soul shall come; and therewith shall be a driver and a witness
And the former shall say unto the unbeliever, thou wast negligent heretofore of this day: But we have removed thy veil from off thee; and thy sight is become piercing this day
And his companion shall say, this is what is ready with me to be attested
And God shall say, cast into hell every unbeliever, and perverse person
and every one who forbad good, and every transgressor, and doubter of the faith
who set up another god with the true God; and cast him into a grievous torment
His companion shall say, O Lord, I did not seduce him; but he was in a wide error
God shall say, wrangle not in my presence: Since I threatened you before hand with the torments which ye now see prepared for you
The sentence is not changed with me: Neither do I treat my servants unjustly
On that day We will say unto hell, art thou full? And it shall answer, is there yet any addition
And paradise shall be brought near unto the pious
and it shall be said unto them, this is what ye have been promised; unto every one who turned himself unto God, and kept his commandments
who feared the Merciful in secret, and came unto Him with a converted heart
Enter the same in peace: This is the day of eternity
Therein shall they have whatever they shall desire; and there will be a superabundant addition of bliss with Us
How many generations have We destroyed before the Meccans, which were more mighty than they in strength? Pass, therefore, through the regions of the earth, and see whether there be any refuge from our vengeance
Verily herein is an admonition unto him who hath a heart to understand, or giveth ear, and is present with an attentive mind
We created the heavens and the earth, and whatever is between them, in six days; and no weariness affected us
Wherefore patiently suffer what they say; and celebrate the praise of thy Lord before sun-rise, and before sun-set
and praise Him in some part of the night: And perform the additional parts of worship
And hearken unto the day whereon the cryer shall call men to judgment from a near place
The day whereon they shall hear the voice of the trumpet in truth: This will be the day of mens coming forth from their graves
We give life, and We cause to die; and unto Us shall be the return of all creatures
The day whereon the earth shall suddenly cleave in sunder over them. This will be an assembly easy for us to assemble
We well know what the unbelievers say; and thou art not sent to compel them forcibly to the faith. Wherefore warn, by the Koran, him who feareth my threatening
By the winds dispersing and scattering the dust
and by the clouds bearing a load of rain
by the ships running swiftly in the sea
and by the angels who distribute things necessary for the support of all creatures
Verily that wherewith ye are threatened is certainly true
and the last judgment will surely come
By the heaven furnished with paths
ye widely differ in what ye say
He will be turned aside from the faith, who shall be turned aside by the divine decree
Cursed be the liars
who wade in deep waters of ignorance, neglecting their salvation
They ask, when will the day of judgment come
On that day shall they be burned in hell fire
and it shall be said unto them, taste your punishment; this is what ye demanded to be hastened
But the pious shall dwell among gardens and fountains
receiving that which their Lord shall give them; because they were righteous doers before this day
They slept but a small part of the night
and early in the morning they asked pardon of God
And a due portion of their wealth was given unto him who asked, and unto him who was forbidden by shame to ask
There are signs of the divine power and goodness in the earth, unto men of sound understanding
and also in your own selves: Will ye not therefore consider
Your sustenance is in the heaven; and also that which ye are promised
Wherefore by the Lord of heaven and earth I swear that this is certainly the truth; according to what yourselves speak
Hath not the story of Abraham's honoured guests come to thy knowledge
When they went in unto him, and said, peace: He answered, peace; saying within himself, these are unknown people
And he went privately unto his family, and brought a fatted calf
And he set it before them, and when he saw they touched it not, he said, do ye not eat
And he began to entertain a fear of them. They said, fear not: And they declared unto him the promise of a wise youth
And his wife drew near with exclamation, and she smote her face, and said, I am an old woman, and barren
The angels answered, thus saith thy Lord: Verily He is the wise, the knowing
And Abraham said unto them, what is your errand, therefore O messengers of God
They answered, verily we are sent unto a wicked people
That we may send down upon them stones of baked clay
marked from thy Lord, for the destruction of transgressors
And we brought forth the true believers who were in the city
But we found not therein more than one family of Moslems
And we overthrew the same, and left a sign therein unto those who dread the severe chastisement of God
In Moses also was a sign: When We sent him unto Pharaoh with manifest power
But he turned back, with his princes, saying, this man is a sorcerer, or a madman
Wherefore We took him and his forces, and cast them into the sea: And he was one worthy of reprehension
And in the tribe of Ad also was a sign: When We sent against them a destroying wind
it touched not ought, whereon it came, but it rendered the same as a thing rotten and reduced to dust
In Thamud likewise was a sign: When it was said unto them, enjoy yourselves for a time
But they insolently transgressed the command of their Lord: Wherefore a terrible noise from heaven assailed them, while they looked on
and they were not able to stand on their feet, neither did they save themselves from destruction
And the people of Noah did We destroy before these: For they were a people who enormously transgressed
We have built the heaven with might; and We have given it a large extent
And We have stretched forth the earth beneath; and how evenly have We spread the same
And of every thing have We created two kinds, that peradventure ye may consider
Fly, therefore, unto God; verily I am a public warner unto you, from Him
And set not up another god with the true God: Verily I am a public warner unto you, from Him
In like manner there came no apostle unto their predecessors, but they said, this man is a magician, or a madman
Have they bequeathed this behaviour successively the one to the other? Yea; they are a people who enormously transgress
Wherefore withdraw from them; and thou shalt not be blameworthy in so doing
Yet continue to admonish: For admonition profiteth the true believers
I have not created genii and men for any other end than that they should serve Me
I require not any sustenance from them; neither will I that they feed Me
Verily God is He who provideth for all creatures; possessed of mighty power
Unto those who shall injure our apostle shall be given a portion like unto the portion of those who behaved like them in times past; and they shall not wish the same to be hastened
Woe, therefore, to the unbelievers, because of their day with which they are threatened
By the mountain of Sinai
and by the book written
in an expanded scroll
and by the visited house
and by the elevated roof of heaven
and by the swelling ocean
Verily the punishment of thy Lord will surely descend
there shall be none to withhold it
On that day the heaven shall be shaken, and shall reel
and the mountains shall walk and pass away
And on that day woe be unto those who accused God's apostles of imposture
who amused themselves in wading in vain disputes
On that day shall they be driven and thrust into the fire of hell
and it shall be said unto them, this is the fire which ye denied as a fiction
Is this a magic illusion? Or do ye not see
Enter the same to be scorched: Whether ye bear your torments patiently, or impatiently, it will be equal unto you: Ye shall surely receive the reward of that which ye have wrought
But the pious shall dwell amidst gardens and pleasures
delighting themselves in what their Lord shall have given them: And their Lord shall deliver them from the pains of hell
And it shall be said unto them, eat and drink with easy digestion; because of that which ye have wrought
Leaning on couches disposed in order: And We will espouse them unto virgins having large black eyes
And unto those who believe, and whose off-spring follow them in the faith, We will join their off-spring in paradise: And We will not diminish unto them ought of the merit of their works. -- Every man is given in pledge for that which he shall have wrought
And we will give them fruits in abundance, and flesh of the kinds which they shall desire
They shall present unto one another therein a cup of wine, wherein there shall be no vain discourse, nor any incitement unto wickedness
And youths appointed to attend them, shall go round them: Beautiful as pearls hidden in their shell
And they shall approach unto one another, and shall ask mutual questions
And they shall say, verily we were heretofore amidst our family, in great dread with regard to our state after death
But God hath been gracious unto us, and hath delivered us from the pain of burning fire
For we called on him heretofore; and he is the beneficent, the merciful
Wherefore do thou, O prophet, admonish thy people. Thou art not, by the grace of thy Lord, a soothsayer, or a madman
Do they say, he is a poet: We wait, concerning him, some adverse turn of fortune
Say, wait ye my ruin: Verily I wait, with you, the time of your destruction
Do their mature understandings bid them say this; or are they people who perversely transgress
Do they say, he hath forged the Koran? Verily they believe not
Let them produce a discourse like unto it, if they speak truth
Were they created by nothing; or were they the creators of themselves
Did they create the heavens and the earth? Verily they are not firmly persuaded that God hath created them
Are the stores of thy Lord in their hands? Are they the supreme dispensers of all things
Have they a ladder, whereby they may ascend to heaven, and hear the discourses of the angels? Let one, therefore, who hath heard them, produce an evident proof thereof
Hath God daughters, and have ye sons
Dost thou ask them a reward for thy preaching? But they are laden with debts
Are the secrets of futurity with them; and do they transcribe the same from the table of God's decrees
Do they seek to lay a plot against thee? But the unbelievers are they who shall be circumvented
Have they any god, besides God? Far be God exalted above the idols which they associate with Him
If they should see a fragment of the heaven falling down upon them, they would say, it is only a thick cloud
Wherefore leave them, until they arrive at their day wherein they shall swoon for fear
A day, in which their subtle contrivances shall not avail them at all, neither shall they be protected
And those who act unjustly shall surely suffer another punishment besides this: But the greater part of them do not understand
And wait thou patiently the judgment of thy Lord concerning them; for thou art in our eye: And celebrate the praise of thy Lord, when thou risest up
and praise Him in the night-season, and when the stars begin to disappear
By the star, when it setteth
your companion Mohammed erreth not, nor is he led astray
Neither doth he speak of his own will
It is no other than a revelation, which hath been revealed unto him
One mighty in power, indued with understanding, taught it him
And He appeared
in the highest part of the horizon
Afterwards He approached the prophet, and drew near unto him
until He was at the distance of two bows length from him, or yet nearer
And He revealed unto his servant that which He revealed
The heart of Mohammed did not falsely represent that which he saw
Will ye therefore dispute with him concerning that which he saw
He also saw him another time
by the lote-tree beyond which there is no passing
Near it is the garden of eternal abode
When the lote-tree covered that which it covered
his eye-sight turned not aside, neither did it wander
And he really beheld some of the greatest signs of his Lord
What think ye of Allat, and Al Uzza
and Manah, that other third goddess
Have ye male children, and God female
This, therefore, is an unjust partition
They are no other than empty names, which ye and your fathers have named goddesses. God hath not revealed concerning them any thing to authorize their worship. They follow no other than a vain opinion, and what their souls desire: Yet hath the true direction come unto them from their Lord
Shall man have whatever he wisheth for
The life to come, and the present life are God's
And how many angels soever there be in the heavens, their intercession shall be of no avail, until after God shall have granted permission unto whom He shall please and shall accept
Verily they who believe not in the life to come give unto the angels a female appellation
But they have no knowledge herein: They follow no other than a bare opinion; and a bare opinion attaineth not any thing of truth
Wherefore withdraw from him who turneth away from our admonition, and seeketh only the present life
This is their highest pitch of knowledge. Verily thy Lord well knoweth him who erreth from his way; and He well knoweth him who is rightly directed
Unto God belongeth whatever is in heaven and earth: That He may reward those who do evil, according to that which they shall have wrought; and may reward those who do well, with the most excellent reward
As to those who avoid great crimes, and hainous sins, and are guilty only of lighter faults; verily thy Lord will be extensive in mercy towards them. He well knew you when He produced you out of the earth, and when ye were embryo's in your mothers' wombs: Wherefore justify not your selves: He best knoweth the man who feareth Him
What thinkest thou of him who turneth aside from following the truth
and giveth little, and covetously stoppeth his hand
Is the knowledge of futurity with him, so that he seeth the same
hath he not been informed of that which is contained in the books of Moses
and of Abraham who faithfully performed his engagements
To wit: That a burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another
and that nothing shall be imputed to a man for righteousness, except his own labour
and that his labour shall surely be made manifest hereafter
and that he shall be rewarded for the same with a most abundant reward
and that unto thy Lord will be the end of all things
and that He causeth to laugh, and causeth to weep
and that He putteth to death, and giveth life
and that He createth the two sexes, the male and the female
of seed when it is emitted
and that unto Him appertaineth another production, namely, the raising of the dead again to life hereafter
and that He enricheth, and causeth to acquire possessions
and that He is the Lord of the dog-star
and that He destroyed the ancient tribe of Ad
and Thamud, and left not any of them alive
and also the people of Noah, before them; for they were most unjust and wicked
And He overthrew the cities which were turned upside down
and that which covered them, covered them
Which, therefore, of thy Lord's benefits, O man, wilt thou call in question
This our apostle is a preacher like the preachers who preceded him
The approaching day of judgment draweth near
There is none who can reveal the exact time of the same, besides God
Do ye, therefore, wonder at this new revelation
and do ye laugh, and not weep
spending your time in idle diversions
But rather worship God, and serve him
The hour of judgment approacheth; and the moon hath been split in sunder
But if the unbelievers see a sign, they turn aside, saying, this is a powerful charm
And they accuse thee, O Mohammed, of imposture, and follow their own lusts: But every thing will be immutably fixed
And now hath a message come unto them, wherein is a determent from obstinate infidelity
the same being consummate wisdom: But warners profit them not
wherefore do thou withdraw from them. The day whereon the summoner shall summon mankind to an ungrateful business
they shall come forth from their graves with down-cast looks: Numerous as locusts scattered far abroad
hastening with terror unto the summoner. The unbelievers shall say, this is a day of distress
The people of Noah accused that prophet of imposture, before thy people rejected thee: They accused our servant of imposture, saying, he is a madman; and he was rejected with reproach
He called, therefore, upon his Lord, saying, verily I am overpowered; wherefore avenge me
So We opened the gates of heaven, with water pouring down
and We caused the earth to break forth into springs; so that the water of heaven and earth met, according to the decree which had been established
And We bare him on a vessel composed of planks and nails
which moved forward under our eyes: As a recompense unto him who had been ungratefully rejected
And We left the said vessel for a sign: But is any one warned thereby
And how severe was my vengeance, and my threatening
Now have We made the Koran easy for admoniton: But is any one admonished thereby
Ad charged their prophet with imposture: But how severe was my vengeance, and my threatening
Verily We sent against them a roaring wind, on a day of continued ill-luck
It carried men away, as though they had been roots of palm-trees forcibly torn up
And how severe was my vengeance, and my threatening
Now have We made the Koran easy for admonition: But is any one admonished thereby
Thamud charged the admonitions of their prophet with falsehood
and said, shall we follow a single man among us? Verily we should then be guilty of error, and preposterous madness
Is the office of admonition committed unto him preferably to the rest of us? Nay; he is a liar, and an insolent fellow
But God said to Saleh, to morrow shall they know who is the liar, and the insolent person
For We will surely send the she-camel for a trial of them; and do thou observe them, and bear their insults with patience
And prophesy unto them that the water shall be divided between them, and each portion shall be sat down to alternately
And they called their companion: And he took a sword, and slew her
But how severe was my vengeance, and my threatening
For We sent against them one cry of the angel Gabriel, and they became like the dry sticks used by him who buildeth a fold for cattle
And now have We made the Koran easy for admonition: But is any one admonished thereby
The people of Lot charged his preaching with falsehood
But We sent against them a wind driving a shower of stones, which destroyed them all except the family of Lot; whom We delivered early in the morning
through favour from Us. Thus do We reward those who are thankful
And Lot had warned them of our severity in chastising; but they doubted of that warning
And they demanded his guests of him, that they might abuse them: But We put out their eyes, saying, taste my vengeance, and my threatening
And early in the morning a lasting punishment surprized them
Taste, therefore, my vengeance, and my threatening
Now have We made the Koran easy for admonition: But is any one admonished thereby
The warning of Moses also came unto the people of Pharaoh
but they charged every one of our signs with imposture: Wherefore We chastised them with a mighty and irresistible chastisement
Are your unbelievers, O Meccans, better than these? Is immunity from punishment promised unto you in the scriptures
Do they say, we are a body of men able to prevail against our enemies
The multitude shall surely be put to flight, and shall turn their back
But the hour of judgment is their threatened time of punishment: And that hour shall be more grievous and more bitter than their afflictions in this life
Verily the wicked wander in error, and shall be tormented hereafter in burning flames
On that day they shall be dragged into the fire on their faces; and it shall be said unto them, taste ye the touch of hell
All things have We created bound by a fixed decree
And our command is no more than a single word, like the twinkling of an eye
We have formerly destroyed nations like unto you; but is any of you warned by their example
Every thing which they do is recorded in the books kept by the guardian angels
And every action, both small and great, is written down in the preserved table
Moreover the pious shall dwell among gardens and rivers
in the assembly of truth, in the presence of a most potent king
The Merciful
hath taught his servant the Koran
He created man
He hath taught him distinct speech
The sun and the moon run their courses according to a certain rule
And the vegetables which creep on the ground, and the trees submit to his disposition
He also raised the heaven; and He appointed the balance
that ye should not transgress in respect to the balance
Wherefore observe a just weight; and diminish not the balance
And the earth hath He prepared for living creatures
Therein are various fruits, and palm-trees bearing sheaths of flowers
and grain having chaff, and leaves
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
He created man of dried clay like an earthen vessel
But He created the genii of fire clear from smoke
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
He is the Lord of the east, and the Lord of the west
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
He hath let loose the two seas, that they meet each another
Between them is placed a bar which they cannot pass
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
From them are taken forth unions and lesser pearls
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
His also are the ships, carrying their sails aloft in the sea, like mountains
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Every creature which liveth on the earth is subject to decay
But the glorious and honourable countenance of thy Lord shall remain for ever
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Unto him do all creatures which are in heaven and earth make petition: Every day is He employed in some new work
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
We will surely attend to judge you, O men and genii, at the last day
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
O ye collective body of genii and men, if ye be able to pass out of the confines of heaven and earth, pass forth: Ye shall not pass forth but by absolute power
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
A flame of fire without smoke, and a smoke without flame shall be sent down upon you; and ye shall not be able to defend yourselves therefrom
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
And when the heaven shall be rent in sunder, and shall become red as a rose, and shall melt like ointment
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
On that day neither man nor genius shall be asked concerning his sin
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
The wicked shall be known by their marks; and they shall be taken by the forelocks, and the feet, and shall be cast into hell
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
This is hell, which the wicked deny as a falsehood
They shall pass to and fro between the same and hot boiling water
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
But for him who dreadeth the tribunal of his Lord, are prepared two gardens
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Planted with shady trees
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
In each of them shall be two fountains flowing
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
In each of them shall there be of every fruit two kinds
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
They shall repose on couches, the linings whereof shall be of thick silk interwoven with gold: And the fruit of the two gardens shall be near at hand to gather
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Therein shall receive them beauteous damsels, refraining their eyes from beholding any besides their spouses: Whom no man shall have deflowered before them, neither any genius
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Having complexions like rubies and pearls
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Shall the reward of good works be any other than good
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
And besides these there shall be two other gardens
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Of a dark green
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
In each of them shall be two fountains pouring forth plenty of water
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
In each of them shall be fruits, and palm-trees, and pomegranates
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Therein shall be agreeable and beauteous damsels
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Having fine black eyes; and kept in pavilions from public view
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Whom no man shall have deflowered, before their destined spouses, nor any genius
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Therein shall they delight themselves, lying on green cushions and beautiful carpets
Which, therefore, of your Lord's benefits will ye ungratefully deny
Blessed be the name of thy Lord, possessed of glory and honour
When the inevitable day of judgment shall suddenly come
no soul shall charge the prediction of its coming with falsehood
It will abase some, and exalt others
When the earth shall be shaken with a violent shock
and the mountains shall be dashed in pieces
and shall become as dust scattered abroad
and ye shall be separated into three distinct classes
The companions of the right hand; -- how happy shall the companions of the right hand be
And the companions of the left hand; -- how miserable shall the companions of the left hand be
And those who have preceded others in the faith, shall precede them to paradise
These are they who shall approach near unto God
They shall dwell in gardens of delight
A [large] company of the former peoples
and few of the last
Reposing on couches adorned with gold and precious stones
sitting opposite to one another thereon
Youths which shall continue in their bloom for ever, shall go round about to attend them
with goblets, and beakers, and a cup of flowing wine
Their heads shall not ache by drinking the same, neither shall their reason be disturbed
And with fruits of the sorts which they shall choose
and the flesh of birds of the kind which they shall desire
And there shall accompany them fair damsels having large black eyes
resembling pearls hidden in their shells
As a reward for that which they shall have wrought
They shall not hear therein any vain discourse, or any charge of sin
but only the salutation, Peace! Peace
And the companions of the right hand -- how happy shall the companions of the right hand be
shall have their abode among lote trees free from thorns
and trees of mauz loaded regularly with their produce from top to bottom
under an extended shade
near a flowing water
and amidst fruits in abundance
which shall not fail, nor shall be forbidden to be gathered
And they shall repose themselves on lofty beds
Verily We have created the damsels of paradise by a peculiar creation
And We have made them virgins
beloved by their husbands, of equal age with them
for the delight of the companions of the right hand
There shall be many of the former religions
and many of the latter
And the companions of the left hand -- how miserable shall the companions of the left hand be
Shall dwell amidst burning winds, and scalding water
under the shade of a black smoke
neither cool nor agreeable
For they enjoyed the pleasures of life before this, while on earth
and obstinately persisted in a heinous wickedness
And they said, after we shall have died, and become dust and bones, shall we surely be raised to life
Shall our forefathers also be raised with us
Say, verily both the first and the last
shall surely be gathered together to judgment, at the prefixed time of a known day
Then ye, O men, who have erred, and denied the resurrection as a falsehood
shall surely eat of the fruit of the tree of al Zakkum
and shall fill your bellies therewith
And ye shall drink thereon boiling water
and ye shall drink as a thirsty camel drinketh
This shall be their entertainment on the day of judgment
We have created you: Will ye not therefore believe that We can raise you from the dead
What think ye? The seed which ye emit
do ye create the same, or are we the creators thereof
We have decreed death unto you all: And We shall not be prevented
We are able to substitute others like unto you in your stead, and to produce you again in the condition or form which ye know not
Ye know the original production by creation; will ye not therefore consider that We are able to reproduce you by resuscitation
What think ye? The grain which ye sow
do ye cause the same to spring forth, or do We cause it to spring forth
If We pleased, verily We could render the same dry and fruitless, so that ye would not cease to wonder, saying
verily we have contracted debts for seed and labour
but we are not permitted to reap the fruit thereof
What think ye? The water which ye drink
do ye send down the same from the clouds, or are We the senders thereof
If We pleased, We could render the same brackish: Will ye not therefore give thanks
What think ye? The fire which ye strike
do ye produce the tree whence ye obtain the same, or are We the producers thereof
We have ordained the same for an admonition, and an advantage unto those who travel through the deserts
Wherefore praise the name of thy Lord, the great God
Moreover I swear by the setting of the stars
and it is surely a great oath, if ye knew it
that this is the excellent Koran
the original whereof is written in the preserved book: None shall touch the same
except those who are clean
It is a revelation from the Lord of all creatures
Will ye, therefore, despise this new revelation
And do ye make this return for your food which ye receive from God, that ye deny yourselves to be obliged to Him for the same
When the soul of a dying person cometh up to his throat
and ye at the same time are looking on
and We are nigher unto him than ye, but ye see not his true condition
would ye not, if ye are not to be rewarded for your actions hereafter
cause the same to return into the body, if ye speak truth
And whether he be of those who shall approach near unto God
his reward shall be rest, and mercy, and a garden of delights
Or whether he be of the companions of the right hand
he shall be saluted with the salutation, Peace be unto thee! By the companions of the right hand, his brethren
Or whether he be of those who have rejected the true faith, and gone astray
his entertainment shall consist of boiling water
and the burning of hell fire
Verily this is a certain truth
Wherefore praise the name of thy Lord, the great God
Whatever is in heaven and earth singeth praise unto God; and He is mighty and wise
His is the kingdom of heaven and earth; He giveth life, and He putteth to death; and He is almighty
He is the first, and the last; the manifest, and the hidden: And He knoweth all things
It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days; and then ascended his throne. He knoweth that which entereth into the earth, and that which issueth out of the same; and that which descendeth from heaven, and that which ascendeth thereto: And He is with you, wheresoever ye be: For God seeth that which ye do
His is the kindgom of heaven and earth; and unto God shall all things return
He causeth the night to succeed the day, and He causeth the day to succeed the night; and He knoweth the innermost part of men's breasts
Believe in God and his apostle, and lay out in alms a part of the wealth whereof God hath made you inheritors: For unto such of you as believe, and bestow alms, shall be given a great reward
And what aileth you, that ye believe not in God, when the apostle inviteth you to believe in your Lord; and He hath received your covenant concerning this matter, if ye believe any proposition
It is He who hath sent down unto his servant evident signs, that He may lead you out of darkness into light; for God is compassionate and merciful unto you
And what aileth you, that ye contribute not of your substance for the defence of God's true religion? Since unto God appertaineth the inheritance of heaven and earth. Those among you who shall have contributed and fought in defence of the faith, before the taking of Mecca, shall not be held equal with those who shall contribute and fight for the same afterwards. These shall be superiour in degree unto those who shall contribute and fight for the propagation of the faith after the abovementioned success: But unto all hath God promised a most excellent reward; and God well knoweth that which ye do
Who is he that will lend unto God an acceptable loan? For He will double the same unto him, and he shall receive moreover an honourable reward
On a certain day, thou shalt see the true believers of both sexes: Their light shall run before them, and on their right hands; and it shall be said unto them, good tidings unto you this day: Gardens through which rivers flow; ye shall remain therein for ever. This will be great felicity
On that day the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women shall say unto those who believe, stay for us, that we may borrow some of your light. It shall be answered, return back into the world, and seek light. And a high wall shall be set betwixt them, wherein shall be a gate, within which shall be mercy; and without it, overagainst the same, the torment of hell
The hypocrites shall call out unto the true believers, saying, were we not with you? They shall answer, yea; but ye seduced your own souls by your hypocrisy: And ye waited our ruin; and ye doubted concerning the faith; and your wishes deceived you, until the decree of God came, and ye died: And the deceiver deceived you concerning God
This day, therefore, a ransom shall not be accepted of you, nor of those who have been unbelievers. Your abode shall be hell fire: This is what ye have deserved; and an unhappy journey shall it be thither
Is not the time yet come unto those who believe, that their hearts should humbly submit to the admonition of God, and to that truth which hath been revealed; and that they be not as those unto whom the scripture was given heretofore, and to whom the time of forbearance was prolonged, but their hearts were hardened, and many of them were wicked doers
Know that God quickeneth the earth, after it hath been dead. Now have We distinctly declared our signs unto you, that ye may understand
Verily as to the almsgivers, both men and women, and those who lend unto God an acceptable loan, He will double the same unto them; and they shall moreover receive an honourable reward
And they who believe in God and his apostles, these are the men of veracity, and the witnesses in the presence of their Lord: They shall have their reward, and their light. But as to those who believe not, and accuse our signs of falsehood, they shall be the companions of hell
Know that this present life is only a toy and a vain amusement: And worldly pomp, and the affectation of glory among you, and the multiplying of riches and children, are as the plants nourished by the rain, the springing up whereof delighteth the husbandmen; afterwards they wither, so that thou seest the same turned yellow, and at length they become dry stubble. And in the life to come will be a severe punishment for those who covet worldly grandeur; and pardon from God, and favour for those who renounce it: For this present life is no other than a deceitful provision
Hasten with emulation to obtain pardon from your Lord, and paradise, the extent whereof equalleth the extent of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in God and his apostles. This is the bounty of God: He will give the same unto whom He pleaseth; and God is endued with great bounty
No accident happeneth in the earth, nor in your persons, but the same was entered in the book of our decrees, before We created it: Verily this is easy with God
And this is written lest ye immoderately grieve for the good which escapeth you, or rejoice for that which happeneth unto you; for God loveth no proud or vain-glorious person
or those who are covetous, and command men covetousness. And whoso turneth aside from giving alms; verily God is self-sufficient, worthy to be praised
We formerly sent our apostles with evident miracles and arguments; and We sent down with them the scriptures, and the balance, that men might observe justice: And We sent them down iron, wherein is mighty strength for war, and various advantages unto mankind: That God may know who assisteth him and his apostles in secret; for God is strong and mighty
We formerly sent Noah and Abraham, and We established in their posterity the gift of prophecy, and the scripture: And of them some were directed, but many of them were evil doers
Afterwards We caused our apostles to succeed in their footsteps; and We caused Jesus the son of Mary to succeed them, and We gave him the gospel: And We put in the hearts of those who followed him, compassion and mercy: But as to the monastic state, they instituted the same -- We did not prescribe it to them -- only out of a desire to please God; yet they observed not the same as it ought truly to have been observed. And We gave unto such of them as believed, their reward: But many of them were wicked doers
O ye who believe in the former prophets, fear God, and believe in his apostle Mohammed: He will give you two portions of his mercy, and He will ordain you a light wherein ye may walk, and He will forgive you; for God is ready to forgive and merciful
That those who have received the scriptures may know that they have not power over any of the favours of God, and that good is in the hand of God; He bestoweth the same on whom He pleaseth, for God is endued with great beneficence
Now hath God heard the speech of her who disputed with thee concerning her husband, and made her complaint unto God; and God hath heard your mutual discourse: For God both heareth and seeth
As to those among you who divorce their wives, by declaring that they will thereafter regard them as their mothers; let them know that they are not their mothers. They only are their mothers who brought them forth; and they certainly utter an unjustifiable saying, and a falsehood: But God is gracious and ready to forgive
Those who divorce their wives by declaring that they will for the future regard them as their mothers, and afterwards would repair what they have said, shall be obliged to free a captive, before they touch one another. This is what ye are warned to perform: And God is well apprized of that which ye do
And whoso findeth not a captive to redeem, shall observe a fast of two consecutive months, before they touch one another. And whoso shall not be able to fast that time, shall feed threescore poor men, This is ordained you, that ye may believe in God and his apostle. These are the statutes of God: And for the unbelievers is prepared a grievous torment
Verily they who oppose God and his apostle, shall be brought low, as the unbelievers who preceded them were brought low. And now have We sent down manifest signs: And an ignominious punishment awaiteth the unbelievers
On a certain day God shall raise them all to life, and shall declare unto them that which they have wrought. God hath taken an exact account thereof; but they have forgotten the same: And God is witness over all things
Dost thou not perceive that God knoweth whatever is in heaven and in earth? There is no private discourse among three persons, but He is the fourth of them; nor among five, but He is the sixth of them; neither among a smaller number than this, nor a larger, but He is with them; wheresoever they be: And He will declare unto them that which they have done, on the day of resurrection; for God knoweth all things
Hast thou not observed those who have been forbidden to use clandestine discourse, but afterwards return to what they have been forbidden, and discourse privily among themselves of wickedness, and enmity, and disobedience towards the apostle? And when they come unto thee, they salute thee with that form of salutation wherewith God doth not salute thee: And they say among themselves, by way of derision, would not God punish us for what we say, if this man were a prophet? Hell shall be their sufficient punishment: They shall go down into the same to be burned; and an unhappy journey shall it be
O true believers, when ye discourse privily together, discourse not of wickedness, and enmity, and disobedience towards the apostle; but discourse of justice, and piety: And fear God, before whom ye shall be assembled
Verily the clandestine discourse of the infidels proceedeth from Satan, that he may grieve the true believers: But there shall be none to hurt them in the least, unless by the permission of God; wherefore in God let the faithful trust
O true believers, when it is said unto you, make room in the assembly; make room: God will grant you ample room in paradise. And when it is said unto you, rise up; rise up: God will raise those of you who believe, and those to whom knowledge is given, to superior degrees of honour: And God is fully apprized of that which ye do
O true believers, when ye go to speak with the apostle, give alms previously to your discoursing with him: This will be better for you, and more pure. But if ye find not what to give, verily God will be gracious and merciful unto you
Do ye fear to give alms previously to your discoursing with the prophet, lest ye should impoverish yourselves? Therefore if ye do it not, and God is gracious unto you, by dispensing with the said precept for the future, be constant at prayer, and pay the legal alms; and obey God and his apostle in all other matters: For God well knoweth that which ye do
Hath thou not observed those who have taken for their friends a people against whom God is incensed? They are neither of you, nor of them: And they swear to a lie knowingly
God hath prepared for them a grievous punishment; for it is evil which they do
They have taken their oaths for a cloak, and they have turned men aside from the way of God: Wherefore a shameful punishment awaiteth them
neither their wealth nor their children shall avail them at all against God. These shall be the inhabitants of hell fire; they shall abide therein for ever
On a certain day God shall raise them all: Then will they swear unto Him, as they swear now unto you, imagining that it will be of service to them. Are they not liars
Satan hath prevailed against them, and hath caused them to forget the remembrance of God. These are the party of the devil; and shall not the party of the devil be doomed to perdition
Verily they who oppose God and his apostle, shall be placed among the most vile
God hath written; verily I will prevail, and my apostles: For God is strong and mighty
Thou shalt not find people who believe in God and the last day, to love him who opposeth God and his apostle; although they be their fathers, or their sons, or their brethren, or their nearest relations. In the hearts of these hath God written faith; and He hath strengthened them with his spirit: And He will lead them into gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to remain therein for ever. God is well pleased in them; and they are well pleased in Him. These are the party of God: And shall not the party of God prosper
Whatever is in heaven and earth celebrateth the praise of God: And He is the mighty, the wise
It was He who caused those who believed not, of the people who receive the scripture, to depart from their habitations at the first emigration. Ye did not think that they would go forth: And they thought that their fortresses would protect them against God. But the chastisement of God came upon them, from whence they did not expect, and He cast terror into their hearts. They pulled down their houses with their own hands, and the hands of the true believers. Wherefore take example from them, O ye who have eyes
And if God had not doomed them to banishment, He had surely punished them in this world; and in the world to come they shall suffer the torment of hell fire
This, because they opposed God and his apostle: And whoso opposeth God, verily God will be severe in punishing him
What palm-trees ye cut down, or left standing on their roots, were so cut down or left by the will of God; and that He might disgrace the wicked doers
And as to the spoils of these people which God hath granted wholly to this apostle, ye did not push forward any horses or camels against the same; but God giveth unto his apostles dominion over whom He pleaseth: For God is almighty
The spoils of the inhabitants of the towns which God hath granted to his apostle, are due unto God and to the apostle, and him who is of kin to the apostle, and the orphans, and the poor, and the traveller; that they may not be for ever divided in a circle among such of you as are rich: What the apostle shall give you, that accept; and what he shall forbid you, that abstain from: And fear God; for God is severe in chastising
A part also belongeth to the poor Mohajerin, who have been dispossessed of their houses and their substance, seeking favour from God, and his good will, and assisting God and his apostle. These are the men of veracity
And they who quietly possessed the town of Medina, and professed the faith without molestation, before them, love him who hath fled unto them, and find in their breasts no want of that which is given the Mohajerin, but prefer them before themselves, although there be indigence among them. And whoso is preserved from the covetousness of his own soul, those shall surely prosper
And they who have come after them say, O Lord, forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in the faith, and put not into our hearts ill-will against those who have believed: O Lord, verily thou art compassionate and merciful
Hast thou not observed them who play the hypocrites? They say unto their brethren who believe not, of those who have received the scriptures, verily if ye be expelled your habitations, we will surely go forth with you; and we will not pay obedience, in your respect, unto any one for ever: And if ye be attacked, we will certainly assist you. But God is witness that they are liars
Verily if they be expelled they will not go forth with them; and if they be attacked, they will not assist them; and if they do assist them, they will surely turn their backs: And they shall not be protected
Verily ye are stronger than they, by reason of the terror cast into their breasts from God. This, because they are not people of prudence
They will not fight against you in a body, except in fenced towns, or from behind walls. Their strength in war among themselves is great: Thou thinkest them to be united; but their hearts are divided. This, because they are people who do not understand
Like those who lately preceded them, they have tasted the evil consequence of their deed; and a painful torment is prepared for them hereafter
Thus have the hypocrites deceived the Jews: Like the devil, when he saith unto a man, be thou an infidel; and when he is become an infidel, he saith, verily I am clear of thee; for I fear God, the Lord of all creatures
Wherefore the end of them both shall be that they shall dwell in hell fire, abiding therein for ever: And this shall be the recompense of the unjust
O true believers, fear God; and let a soul look what it sendeth before for the morrow: And fear God, for God is well acquainted with that which ye do
And be not as those who have forgotten God, and whom He hath caused to forget their own souls: These are the wicked doers
The inhabitants of hell fire, and the inhabitants of paradise shall not be held equal. The inhabitants of paradise are they who shall enjoy felicity
If We had sent down this Koran on a mountain, thou wouldest certainly have seen the same humble itself, and cleave in sunder for fear of God. These similitudes do We propose unto men, that they may consider
He is God, besides whom there is no God; Who knoweth that which is future, and that which is present: He is the most Merciful
He is God, besides whom there is no God: The King, the Holy, the Giver of peace, the Faithful, the Guardian, the Powerful, the Strong, the most High. Far be God exalted above the idols which they associate with Him
He is God, the Creator, the Maker, the Former. He hath most excellent names. Whatever is in heaven and earth praiseth Him: And He is the Mighty, the Wise
O true believers, take not my enemy and your enemy for your friends, shewing kindness toward them; since they believe not in the truth which hath come unto you, having expelled the apostle and yourselves from your native city, because ye believe in God, your Lord. If ye go forth to fight in defence of my religion, and out of a desire to please me, and privately shew friendship unto them; verily I well know that which ye conceal, and that which ye discover: And whoever of you doth this, hath already erred from the strait path
If they get the better of you, they will be enemies unto you, and they will stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil: And they earnestly desire that ye should become unbelievers
Neither your kindred nor your children will avail you at all on the day of resurrection, which will separate you from one another: And God seeth that which ye do
Ye have an excellent pattern in Abraham, and those who were with him, when they said unto their people, verily we are clear of you, and of the idols which ye worship, besides God: We have renounced you; and enmity and hatred is begun between us and you for ever, until ye believe in God alone: Except Abraham's saying unto his father, verily I will beg pardon for thee; but I cannot obtain ought of God in thy behalf. O Lord, in thee do we trust, and unto thee are we turned; and before thee shall we be assembled hereafter
O Lord, suffer us not to be put to trial by the unbelievers: And forgive us, O Lord; for thou art mighty and wise
Verily ye have in them an excellent example, unto him who hopeth in God and the last day: And whoso turneth back; verily God is self sufficient, and praise worthy
Peradventure God will establish friendship between yourselves and such of them as ye now hold for enemies: For God is powerful; and God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
As to those who have not born arms against you on account of religion, nor turned you out of your dwellings, God forbideth you not to deal kindly with them, and to behave justly towards them; for God loveth those who act justly
But as to those who have born arms against you on account of religion, and have dispossessed you of your habitations, and have assisted in dispossessing you, God forbideth you to enter into friendship with them: And whosoever of you enters into friendship with them, those are unjust doers
O true believers, when believing women come unto you as refugees, try them: God well knoweth their faith. And if ye know them to be true believers, send them not back to the infidels: They are not lawful for the unbelievers to have in marriage; neither are the unbelievers lawful for them. But give their unbelieving husbands what they shall have expended for their dowers. Nor shall it be any crime in you if ye marry them, provided ye give them their dowries. And retain not the patronage of the unbelieving women: But demand back that which ye have expended for the dowry of such of your wives as go over to the unbelievers; and let them demand back that which they have expended for the dowry of those who come over to you. This is the judgment of God, which He establisheth among you: And God is knowing and wise
If any of your wives escape from you to the unbelievers, and ye have your turn by the coming over of any of the unbelievers wives to you; give unto those believers whose wives shall have gone away, out of the dowries of the latter, so much as they shall have expended for the dowers of the former: And fear God, in whom ye believe
O prophet, when believing women come unto thee, and plight their faith unto thee, that they will not associate any thing with God, nor steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill their children, nor come with a calumny which they have forged between their hands and their feet, nor be disobedient to thee in that which shall be reasonable: Then do thou plight thy faith unto them, and ask pardon for them of God; for God is inclined to forgive, and merciful
O true believers, enter not into friendship with a people against whom God is incensed: They despair of the life to come, as the infidels despair of the resurrection of those who dwell in the graves
Whatever is in heaven and in earth celebrateth the praise of God; for He is mighty and wise
O true believers, why do ye say that which ye do not
It is most odious in the sight of God, that ye say that which ye do not
Verily God loveth those who fight for his religion in battle array, as though they were a well compacted building
Remember when Moses said unto his people, O my people, why do ye injure me; since ye know that I am the apostle of God sent unto you? And when they had deviated from the truth, God made their hearts to deviate from the right way; for God directeth not wicked people
And when Jesus the Son of Mary said, O children of Israel, verily I am the apostle of God sent unto you, confirming the law which was delivered before me, and bringing good tidings of an apostle who shall come after me, and whose name shall be Ahmed. And when he produced unto them evident miracles, they said, this is manifest sorcery
But who is more unjust than he who forgeth a lie against God, when he is invited unto Islam? And God directeth not the unjust people
They seek to extinguish God's light with their mouths: But God will perfect his light, though the infidels be averse thereto
It is He who hath sent his apostle with the direction, and the religion of truth, that he may exalt the same above every religion, although the idolaters be averse thereto
O true believers, shall I shew you a merchandize which will deliver you from a painful torment hereafter
Believe in God and his apostle; and defend God's true religion with your substance, and in your own persons. This will be better for you, if ye knew it
He will forgive you your sins, and will introduce you into gardens through which rivers flow, and agreeable habitations in gardens of perpetual abode. This will be great felicity
And ye shall obtain other things which ye desire, namely, assistance from God, and a speedy victory. And do thou bear good tidings to the true believers
O true believers, be ye the assistants of God; as Jesus the son of Mary said to the apostles, who will be my assistants with respect to God? The apostles answered, we will be the assistants of God. So a part of the children of Israel believed, and a part believed not: But We strengthened those who believed, above their enemy; wherefore they became victorious over them
Whatever is in heaven and earth praiseth God; the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise
It is He who hath raised up amidst the illiterate Arabians an apostle from among themselves, to rehearse his signs unto them, and to purify them, and to teach them the scriptures and wisdom; whereas before they were certainly in a manifest error
And others of them have not yet attained unto them, by embracing the faith; though they also shall be converted in God's good time; for He is mighty and wise
This is the free grace of God: He bestoweth the same on whom He pleaseth : And God is endued with great beneficence
The likeness of those who were charged with the observance of the law, and then observed it not, is as the likeness of an ass laden with books: How wretched is the likeness of the people who charge the signs of God with falsehood! And God directeth not the unjust people
Say, O ye who follow the Jewish religion, if ye say that ye are the friends of God above other men, wish for death, if ye speak truth
But they will never wish for it, because of that which their hands have sent before them: And God well knoweth the unjust
Say, verily death, from which ye fly, will surely meet you: Then shall ye be brought before Him who knoweth as well what is concealed as what is discovered; and He will delare unto you that which ye have done
O true believers, when ye are called to prayer on the day of the assembly, hasten to the commemoration of God, and leave merchandizing. This will be better for you, if ye knew it
And when prayer is ended, then disperse yourselves through the land as ye list, and seek gain of the liberality of God: And remember God frequently, that ye may prosper
But when they see any merchandizing, or sport, they flock thereto, and leave thee standing up in thy pulpit. Say, the reward which is with God is better than any sport or merchandize: And God is the best provider
When the hypocrites come unto thee, they say, we bear witness that thou art indeed the apostle of God. And God knoweth that thou art indeed his apostle: But God beareth witness that the hypocrites are certainly liars
They have taken their oaths for a protection, and they turn others aside from the way of God: It is surely evil which they do
This is testified of them, because they believed, and afterwards became unbelievers: Wherefore a seal is set on their hearts, and they shall not understand
When thou beholdest them, their persons please thee: And if they speak, thou hearest their discourse with delight. They resemble pieces of timber set up against a wall. They imagine every shout to be against them. They are enemies; wherefore beware of them. God curse them: How are they turned aside from the truth
And when it is said unto them, come, that the apostle of God may ask pardon for you; they turn away their heads, and thou seest them retire big with disdain
It shall be equal unto them, whether thou ask pardon for them, or do not ask pardon for them; God will by no means forgive them: For God directeth not the prevaricating people
These are the men who say to the inhabitants of Medina, do not bestow any thing on the refugees who are with the apostle of God, that they may be obliged to separate from him. Whereas unto God belong the stores of heaven and earth: But the hypocrites do not understand
They say, verily, if we return to Medina, the worthier shall expel thence the meaner. Whereas superior worth belongeth unto God, and his apostle, and the true believers: But the hypocrites know it not
O true believers, let not your riches or your children divert you from the remembrance of God: For whosoever doth this, they will surely be losers
And give alms out of that which We have bestowed on you; before death come unto one of you, and he say, O Lord, wilt thou not grant me respite for a short term; that I may give alms, and become one of the righteous
For God will by no means grant further respite to a soul, when its determined time is come: And God is fully apprized of that which ye do
Whatever is in heaven and earth celebrateth the praises of God: His is the kingdom, and unto Him is the praise due; for He is almighty
It is He who hath created you; and one of you is predestined to be an unbeliever, and another of you is predestined to be a believer: And God beholdeth that which ye do
He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth; and He hath fashioned you, and given you beautiful forms: And unto Him must ye all go
He knoweth whatever is in heaven and earth: And He knoweth that which ye conceal, and that which ye discover; for God knoweth the innermost part of mens breasts
Have ye not been acquainted with the story of those who disbelieved heretofore, and tasted the evil consequence of their behaviour? And for them is prepared, in the life to come, a tormenting punishment
This shall they suffer, because their apostles came unto them with evident proofs of their mission, and they said, shall men direct us? Wherefore they believed not, and turned their backs. But God standeth in need of no person: For God is self-sufficient, and worthy to be praised
The unbelievers imagine that they shall not be raised again. Say, yea, by my Lord, ye shall surely be raised again: Then shall ye be told that which ye have wrought; and this is easy with God
Wherefore believe in God and his apostle, and the light which We have sent down: For God is well acquainted with that which ye do
On a certain day He shall assemble you, at the day of the general assembly: That will be the day of mutual deceit: And whoso shall believe in God, and shall do that which is right, from him will He expiate his evil deeds, and He will lead him into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to remain therein for ever. This will be great felicity
But they who shall not believe, and shall accuse our signs of falsehood, those shall be the inhabitants of hell fire, wherein they shall remain for ever; and a wretched journey shall it be thither
No misfortune happeneth but by the permission of God; and whoso believeth in God, he will direct his heart: And God knoweth all things
Wherefore obey God, and obey the apostle; But if ye turn back, verily the duty incumbent on our apostle is only public preaching
God! There in no God but He: Wherefore in God let the faithful put their trust
O true believers, verily of your wives and your children ye have an enemy: Wherefore beware of them. But if ye pass over their offences, and pardon, and forgive them; God is likewise inclined to forgive, and merciful
Your wealth and your children are only a temptation: But with God is a great reward
Wherefore fear God, as much as ye are able; and hear, and obey: And give alms, for the good of your souls; for whoso is preserved from the covetousness of his own soul, they shall prosper
If ye lend unto God an acceptable loan, He will double the same unto you, and will forgive you: For God is grateful and long-suffering
knowing both what is hidden, and what is divulged; the mighty, the wise
O prophet, when ye divorce women, put them away at their appointed term; and compute the term exactly: And fear God, your Lord. Oblige them not to go out of their apartments, neither let them go out, until the term be expired, unless they be guilty of manifest uncleanness. These are the statutes of God: And whoever transgresseth the statutes of God, assuredly injureth his own soul: Thou knowest not whether God will bring something new to pass, which may reconcile them, after this
And when they shall have fulfilled their term, either retain them with kindness, or part from them honourably: And take witnesses from among you, men of integrity; and give your testimony as in the presence of God: This admonition is given unto him who believeth in God and the last day: And whoso feareth God, unto him will He grant a happy issue out of all his afflictions
and He will bestow on him an ample provision from whence he expecteth it not: And whoso trusteth in God, He will be his sufficient support; for God will surely attain his purpose. Now hath God appointed unto every thing a determined period
As to such of your wives as shall despair having their courses, by reason of their age; if ye be in doubt thereof, let their term be three months: And let the same be the term of those who have not yet had their courses. But as to those who are pregnant, their term shall be, until they be delivered of their burden. And whoso feareth God, unto him will He make his command easy
This is the command of God, which He hath sent down unto you. And whoso feareth God, He will expiate his evil deeds from him, and will increase his reward
Suffer the women whom ye divorce to dwell in some part of the houses wherein ye dwell; according to the room and conveniences of the habitations which ye possess: And make them not uneasy, that ye may reduce them to straits. And if they be with child, expend on them what shall be needful, until they be delivered of their burden. And if they suckle their children for you, give them their hire; and consult among yourselves, according to what shall be just and reasonable. And if ye be put to a difficulty herein, and another woman shall suckle the child for him
let him who hath plenty expend proportionably, in the maintenance of the mother and the nurse, out of his plenty: And let him whose income is scanty, expend in proportion out of that which God hath given him. God obligeth no man to more than He hath given him ability to perform: God will cause ease to succeed hardship
How many cities have turned aside from the command of their Lord and his apostles? Wherefore We brought them to a severe account; and We chastised them with a grievous chastisement
And they tasted the evil consequence of their business; and the end of their business was perdition
God hath prepared for them a severe punishment: Wherefore fear God, O ye who are indued with understanding. True believers, now hath God sent down unto you an admonition
an apostle who may rehearse unto you the perspicuous signs of God; that he may bring forth those who believe and do good works, from darkness into light. And whoso believeth in God, and doth that which is right, him will He lead into gardens beneath which rivers flow, to remain therein for ever: Now hath God made an excellent provision for him
It is God who hath created seven heavens, and as many different stories of the earth: The divine command descendeth between them; that ye may know that God is omnipotent, and that God comprehendeth all things by his knowledge
O prophet, why holdest thou that to be prohibited which God hath allowed thee, seeking to please thy wives; since God is inclined to forgive and merciful
God hath allowed you the dissolution of your oaths: And God is your master; and He is knowing and wise
When the prophet intrusted as a secret unto one of his wives a certain accident; and when she disclosed the same, and God made it known unto him; he acquainted her with part of what she had done, and forbore to upbraid her with the other part thereof. And when he had acquainted her therewith, she said, who hath discovered this unto thee? He answered, the knowing, the sagacious God hath discovered it unto me
If ye both be turned unto God -- for your hearts have swerved -- it is well: But if ye join against him, verily God is his patron; and Gabriel, and the good man among the faithful, and the angels also are his assistants
If he divorce you, his Lord can easily give him in exchange other wives better than you, women resigned unto God, true believers, devout, penitent, obedient, given to fasting, both such as have been known by other men, and virgins
O true believers, save your souls, and those of your families, from the fire whose fuel is men and stones, over which are set angels fierce and terrible; who disobey not God in what He hath commanded them, but perform what they are commanded
O unbelievers, excuse not yourselves this day; ye shall surely be rewarded for what ye have done
O true believers, turn unto God with a sincere repentance: Peradventure your Lord will do away from you your evil deeds, and will admit you into gardens, through which rivers flow; on the day whereon God will not put to shame the prophet, or those who believe with him: Their light shall run before them, and on their right hands, and they shall say, Lord, make our light perfect, and forgive us; for thou art almighty
O prophet, attack the infidels with arms, and the hypocrites with arguments; and treat them with severity: Their abode shall be hell, and an ill journey shall it be thither
God propoundeth as a similitude unto the unbelievers, the wife of Noah, and the wife of Lot: They were under two of our righteous servants, and they deceived them both; wherefore their husbands were of no advantage unto them at all, in the sight of God: And it shall be said unto them, at the last day, enter ye into hell fire, with those who enter therein
God also propoundeth as a similitude unto those who believe, the wife of Pharaoh; when she said, Lord, build me an house with thee in paradise; and deliver me from Pharaoh and his doings, and deliver me from the unjust people
And Mary the daughter of Imran; who preserved her chastity, and into whose womb we breathed of our spirit, and who believed in the words of her Lord and his scriptures, and was a devout and obedient person
Blessed be He in whose hand is the kingdom; for He is almighty
Who hath created death and life, that He might prove you, which of you is most righteous in his actions: And He is mighty, and ready to forgive
Who hath created seven heavens, one above another: Thou canst not see in a creature of the most Merciful any unfitness or disproportion. Lift up thine eyes again to heaven, and look whether thou seest any flaw
Then take two other views; and thy sight shall return unto thee dull and fatigued
Moreover We have adorned the lowest heaven with lamps, and have appointed them to be darted at the devils, for whom We have prepared the torment of burning fire
And for those who believe not in their Lord, is also prepared the torment of hell; an ill journey shall it be thither
When they shall be thrown thereinto, they shall hear it bray like an ass; and it shall boil
and almost burst for fury. So often as a company of them shall be thrown therein, the keepers thereof shall ask them, saying, did not a warner come unto you
They shall answer, yea, a warner came unto us: But we accused him of imposture, and said, God hath not revealed any thing; ye are in no other than a great error
And they shall say, if we had hearkened, or had rightly considered, we should not have been among the inhabitants of burning fire
And they shall confess their sins; but far be the inhabitants of burning fire from obtaining mercy
Verily they who fear their Lord in secret, shall receive pardon and a great reward
Either conceal your discourse, or make it public; He knoweth the innermost parts of your breasts
Shall not He know all things who hath created them; since He is the sagacious, the knowing
It is He who hath levelled the earth for you: Therefore walk through the regions thereof, and eat of his provision; unto Him shall be the resurrection
Are ye secure that He who dwelleth in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up? And behold, it shall shake
Or are ye secure that He who dwelleth in heaven will not send against you an impetuous whirlwind, driving the sands to overwhelm you? Then shall ye know how important my warning was
Those also who were before you disbelieved; and how grievous was my displeasure
Do they not behold the birds above them, extending and drawing back their wings? None sustaineth them, except the Merciful; for He regardeth all things
Or who is he that will be as an army unto you, to defend you against the Merciful? Verily the unbelievers are in no other than a mistake
Or who is he that will give you food, if He withholdeth his provision? Yet they persist in perverseness, and flying from the truth
Is he, therefore, who goeth grovelling upon his face, better directed than he who walketh upright in a strait way
Say, it is He who hath given you being, and endued you with hearing, and sight, and understanding; yet how little gratitude have ye
Say, it is He who hath sown you in the earth, and unto Him shall ye be gathered together
They say, when shall this menace be put in execution if ye speak truth
Answer, the knowledge of this matter is with God alone: For I am only a public warner
But when they shall see the same nigh at hand, the countenance of the infidels shall grow sad: And it shall be said unto them, this is what ye have been demanding
Say, what think ye? Whether God destroy me and those who are with me, or have mercy on us; who will protect the unbelievers from a painful punishment
Say, He is the Merciful; in Him do we believe, and in Him do we put our trust. Ye shall hereafter know who is in a manifest error
Say, what think ye? If your water be in the morning swallowed up by the earth, who will give you clear and running water
By the pen, and what they write
thou, O Mohammed, through the grace of thy Lord, art not distracted
Verily there is prepared for thee an everlasting reward
For thou art of a noble disposition
Thou shalt see, and the infidels shall see
which of you are bereaved of your senses
Verily thy Lord well knoweth him who wandereth from his path; and He well knoweth those who are rightly directed
Wherefore obey not those who charge thee with imposture
They desire that thou shouldest be easy with them, and they will be easy with thee
But obey not any who is a common swearer, a despicable fellow
a defamer, going about with slander
who forbiddeth that which is good, who is also a transgressor, a wicked person
cruel, and besides this, of spurious birth
Although he be possessed of wealth and many children
When our signs are rehearsed unto him, he saith, they are fables of the ancients
We will stigmatize him on the nose
Verily We have tried the Meccans, as We formerly tried the owners of the garden; when they swore that they would gather the fruit thereof in the morning
and added not the exception, if it please God
Wherefore a surrounding destruction from thy Lord encompassed it, while they slept
and in the morning it became like a garden whose fruits had been gathered
And they called the one to the other as they rose in the morning, saying
Go out early to your plantation, if ye intend to gather the fruit thereof
So they went on, whispering to one another
no poor man shall enter the garden upon you, this day
And they went forth early, with a determined purpose
And when they saw the garden blasted and destroyed, they said, we have certainly mistaken our way
But when they found it to be their own garden, they cried, verily we are not permitted to reap the fruit thereof
The worthier of them said, did I not say unto you, will ye not give praise unto God
They answered, praise be unto our Lord! Verily we have been unjust doers
And they began to blame one another
and they said, woe be unto us! Verily we have been transgressors
Peradventure our Lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this: And we earnestly beseech our Lord to pardon us
Thus is the chastisement of this life: But the chastisement of the next shall be more grievous; if they had known it, they would have taken heed
Verily for the pious are prepared, with their Lord, gardens of delight
Shall we deal with the Moslems, as with the wicked
What aileth you that ye judge thus
Have ye a book from heaven, wherein ye read
that ye are therein promised that which ye shall choose
Or have ye received oaths which shall be binding upon us to the day of resurrection, that ye shall enjoy what ye imagine
Ask them, which of them will be the voucher of this
Or have they companions who will vouch for them? Let them produce their companions, therefore, if they speak truth
On a certain day the leg shall be made bare; and they shall be called upon to worship, but they shall not be able
Their looks shall be cast down: Ignominy shall attend them: For that they were invited to the worship of God, while they were in safety, but would not hear
Let Me alone, therefore, with him who accuseth this new revelation of imposture. We will lead them gradually to destruction, by ways which they know not
And I will bear with them for a long time; for my stratagem is effectual
Dost thou ask them any reward for thy preaching? But they are laden with debts
Are the secrets of futurity with them; and do they transcribe the same from the table of God's decrees
Wherefore patiently wait the judgment of thy Lord: And be not like him who was swallowed by the fish; when he cried unto God, being inwardly vexed
Had not grace from his Lord reached him, he had surely been cast forth on the naked shore, covered with shame
But his Lord chose him, and made him one of the righteous
It wanteth little but that the unbelievers strike thee down with their malicious looks, when they hear the admonition of the Koran; and they say, he is certainly distracted
But it is no other than an admonition unto all creatures
The infallible
What is the infallible
And what shall cause thee to understand what the infallible is
The tribes of Thamud and Ad denied as a falsehood the day which shall strike men's hearts with terror
But Thamud were destroyed by a terrible noise
And Ad were destroyed by a roaring and furious wind
which God caused to assail them for seven nights and eight days successively: Thou mightest have seen people, during the same, lying prostrate, as though they had been the roots of hollow palm-trees
and couldest thou have seen any of them remaining
Pharaoh also, and those who were before him, and the cities which were overthrown, were guilty of sin
and they severally were disobedient to the apostle of their Lord; wherefore He chastised them with an abundant chastisement
When the water of the deluge arose, We carried you in the ark which swam thereon
that We might make the same a memorial unto you, and the retaining ear might retain it
And when one blast shall sound the trumpet
and the earth shall be moved from its place, and the mountains also, and shall be dashed in pieces at one stroke
On that day the inevitable hour of judgment shall suddenly come
and the heavens shall cleave in sunder, and shall fall in pieces, on that day
And the angels shall be on the sides thereof; and eight shall bear the throne of thy Lord above them, on that day
On that day ye shall be presented before the judgment seat of God; and none of your secret actions shall be hidden
And he who shall have his book delivered into his right hand, shall say, take ye, read this my book
verily I thought that I should be brought to this my account
He shall lead a pleasing life
in a lofty garden
the fruits whereof shall be near to gather
Eat and drink with easy digestion; because of the good works which ye sent before you, in the days which are past
But he who shall have his book delivered into his left hand, shall say, O that I had not received this my book
and that I had not known what this my account was
O that death had made an end of me
My riches have not profited me
and my power is passed from me
And God shall say to the keepers of hell, take him, and bind him
and cast him into hell to be burned
then put him into a chain of the length of seventy cubits
Because he believed not in the great God
and was not solicitous to feed the poor
Wherefore this day he shall have no friend here
nor any food, but the filthy corruption flowing from the bodies of the damned
which none shall eat but the sinners
I swear by that which ye see
and that which ye see not
that this is the discourse of an honourable apostle
and not the discourse of a poet: How little do ye believe
Neither is it the discourse of a soothsayer: How little are ye admonished
It is a revelation from the Lord of all creatures
If Mohammed had forged any part of these discourses concerning Us
verily We had taken him by the right hand
and had cut in sunder the vein of his heart
neither would We have withheld any of you from chastising him
And verily this book is an admonition unto the pious
and We well know that there are some of you who charge the same with imposture
But it shall surely be an occasion of grievous sighing unto the infidels
for it is the truth of a certainty
Wherefore praise the name of thy Lord, the great God
One demanded and called for vengeance to fall on the unbelievers
There shall be none to avert the same
from being inflicted by God, the possessor of the steps
by which the angels ascend unto Him, and the spirit Gabriel also, in a day whose space is fifty thousand years
Wherefore bear the insults of the Meccans with becoming patience
for they see their punishment afar off
but We see it nigh at hand
On a certain day the heaven shall become like molten brass
and the mountains like wool of various colours, scattered abroad by the wind
And a friend shall not ask a friend concerning his condition, although
they see one another. The wicked shall wish to redeem himself from the punishment of that day, by giving up his children
and his wife, and his brother
and his kindred who shewed kindness unto him
and all who are in the earth; and that this might deliver him
By no means: For hell fire
dragging them by their scalps
shall call him who shall have turned his back, and fled from the faith
and shall have amassed riches, and covetously hoarded them
Verily man is created extremely impatient
When evil toucheth him, he is full of complaint
but when good befalleth him, he becometh niggardly
Except those who are devoutly given
and who persevere in their prayers
and those of whose substance a due and certain portion is ready to be given
unto him who asketh, and him who is forbidden by shame to ask
And those who sincerely believe the day of judgment
and who dread the punishment of their Lord
For there is none secure from the punishment of their Lord
And who abstain from the carnal knowledge
of women other than their wives, or the slaves which their right hands possess; -- for as to them they shall be blameless
but whoever coveteth any woman besides these, they are transgressors
And those who faithfully keep what they are intrusted with, and their covenant
and who are upright in their testimonies
and who carefully observe the requisite rites in their prayers
These shall dwell amidst gardens, highly honoured
What aileth the unbelievers, that they run before thee
in companies, on the right hand and on the left
Doth every man of them wish to enter into a garden of delight
By no means: Verily We have created them of that which they know
I swear by the Lord of the east and of the west, that We are able to destroy them
and to substitute better than them in their room; neither are We to be prevented, if We shall please so to do
Wherefore suffer them to wade in vain disputes, and to amuse themselves with sport: Until they meet their day with which they have been threatened
the day whereon they shall come forth hastily from their graves, as though they were troops hastening to their standard
Their looks shall be downcast; ignominy shall attend them. This is the day with which they have been threatened
Verily We sent Noah unto his people, saying, warn thy people, before a grievous punishment overtake them
Noah said, O my people, verily I am a public warner unto you
Wherefore serve God, and fear Him, and obey me
He will forgive you part of your sins, and will grant you respite until a determined time: For God's determined time, when it cometh, shall not be deferred; if ye were men of understanding, ye would know this
He said, Lord, verily I have called my people night and day
but my calling only increaseth their aversion
And whensoever I call them to the true faith, that Thou mayest forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, and cover themselves with their garments, and persist in their infidelity, and proudly disdain my counsel
Moreover I invited them openly
and I spake to them again in public; and I also secretly admonished them in private
And I said, beg pardon of your Lord; for He is inclined to forgive
And He will cause the heaven to pour down rain plentifully upon you
and will give you increase of wealth and of children; and He will provide you gardens, and furnish you with rivers
What aileth you, that ye hope not for benevolence in God
since He hath created you variously
Do ye not see how God hath created the seven heavens, one above another
and hath placed the moon therein for a light, and hath appointed the sun for a taper
God hath also produced and caused you to spring forth from the earth
Hereafter He will cause you to return into the same; and He will again take you thence, by bringing you forth from your graves
And God hath spread the earth as a carpet for you
that ye may walk therein through spacious paths
Noah said, Lord, verily they are disobedient unto me; and they follow him whose riches and children do no other than increase his perdition
And they devised a dangerous plot against Noah
And the chief men said to the others, ye shall by no means leave your gods; neither shall ye forsake Wadd, nor Sowa, nor Yaghuth, and Yauk, and Nesr
And they seduced many; -- for thou shalt only increase error in the wicked
Because of their sins they were drowned, and cast into the fire of hell; and they found none to protect them against God
And Noah said, Lord, leave not any families of the unbelievers on the earth
For if thou leave them, they will seduce thy servants, and will beget none but a wicked and unbelieving offspring
Lord, forgive me and my parents, and every one who shall enter my house, being a true believer, and the true believers of both sexes; and add unto the unjust doers nothing but destruction
Say, it hath been revealed unto me that a company of genii attentively heard me reading the Koran, and said, verily we have heard an admirable discourse
which directeth unto the right institution: Wherefore we believe therein, and we will by no means associate any other with our Lord
He -- may the majesty of our Lord be exalted! -- hath taken no wife, nor hath He begotten any issue
Yet the foolish among us hath spoken that which is extremely false of God
But we verily thought that neither man nor genius would by any means have uttered a lie concerning God
And there are certain men who fly for refuge unto certain of the genii; but they increase their folly and transgression
And they also thought, as ye thought, that God would not raise any one to life
And we formerly attempted to pry into what was transacting in heaven; but we found the same filled with a strong guard of angels, and with flaming darts
And we sat on some of the seats thereof to hear the discourse of its inhabitants; but whoever listeneth now, findeth a flame laid in ambush for him, to guard the celestial confines
And we know not whether evil be hereby intended against those who are in the earth, or whether their Lord intendeth to direct them aright
There are some among us who are upright; and there are some among us who are otherwise: We are of different ways
And we verily thought that we could by no means frustrate God in the earth, neither could we escape Him by flight
Wherefore, when we had heard the direction contained in the Koran, we believed therein. And whoever believeth in his Lord, need not fear any diminution of his reward, nor any injustice
There are some Moslems among us; and there are others of us who swerve from righteousness. And whoso embraceth Islam, they earnestly seek true direction
But those who swerve from righteousness, shall be fuel for hell
If they tread in the way of truth, We will surely water them with abundant rain
that We may prove them thereby: But whoso turneth aside from the admonition of his Lord, him will he send into a severe torment
Verily the places of worship are set apart unto God: Wherefore invoke not any other therein together with God
When the servant of God stood up to invoke Him, it wanted little but that the genii had pressed on him in crouds, to hear him rehearse the Koran
Say, verily I call upon my Lord only, and I associate no other god with Him
Say, verily I am not able, of myself, to procure you either hurt, or a right institution
Say, verily none can protect me against God; neither shall I find any refuge besides Him
I can do no more than publish what hath been revealed unto me from God, and his messages. And whosoever shall be disobedient unto God and his apostle, for him is the fire of hell prepared; they shall remain therein for ever
Until they see the vengeance with which they are threatened, they will not cease their opposition: But then shall they know who were the weaker in a protector, and the fewer in number
Say, I know not whether the punishment with which ye are threatened be nigh, or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term
He knoweth the secrets of futurity; and He doth not communicate his secrets unto any
except an apostle in whom He is well pleased: And He causeth a guard of angels to march before Him, and behind Him
that He may know that they have executed the commissions of their Lord: He comprehendeth whatever is with them; and counteth all things by number
O thou wrapped up
arise to prayer, and continue therein during the night
except a small part; that is to say, during one half thereof: Or do thou lessen the same a little
or add thereto. And repeat the Koran with a distinct and sonorous voice
For We will lay on thee a weighty word
Verily the rising by night is more efficacious for stedfast continuance in devotion, and more conducive to decent pronunciation
For in the day-time thou hast long employment
And commemorate the name of thy Lord: And separate thy self unto Him, renouncing worldly vanities
He is the Lord of the east, and of the west; there is no God but He. Wherefore take Him for thy patron
And patiently suffer the contumelies which the infidels utter against thee; and depart from them with a decent departure
And let Me alone with those who charge the Koran with falsehood, who enjoy the blessings of this life; and bear with them for a while
Verily with Us are heavy fetters, and a burning fire
and food ready to choke him who swalloweth it, and painful torment
On a certain day the earth shall be shaken, and the mountains also, and the mountains shall become a heap of sand poured forth
Verily We have sent unto you an apostle, to bear witness against you; as We sent an apostle unto Pharaoh
But Pharaoh was disobedient unto the apostle; wherefore We chastised him with a heavy chastisement
How, therefore, will ye escape, if ye believe not, the day which shall make children become greyheaded through terror
The heaven shall be rent in sunder thereby: The promise thereof shall surely be performed
Verily this is an admonition; and whoever is willing to be admonished, will take the way unto his Lord
Thy Lord knoweth that thou continuest in prayer and meditation sometimes near two third parts of the night, and sometimes one half thereof, and at other times one third part thereof: And a part of thy companions, who are with thee, do the same. But God measureth the night and the day; he knoweth that ye cannot exactly compute the same: Wherefore He turneth favourably unto you. Read, therefore, so much of the Koran as may be easy unto you. He knoweth that there will be some infirm among you; and others travel through the earth, that they may obtain a competency of the bounty of God; and others fight in the defence of God's faith. Read, therefore, so much of the same as may be easy. And observe the stated times of prayer, and pay the legal alms; and lend unto God an acceptable loan; for whatever good ye send before for your souls, ye shall find the same with God. This will be better, and will merit a greater reward. And ask God forgiveness; for God is ready to forgive, and merciful
O thou covered
arise and preach
and magnify thy Lord
And cleanse thy garments
And fly every abomination
And be not liberal, in hopes to receive more in return
And patiently wait for thy Lord
When the trumpet shall sound
verily that day shall be a day of distress
and uneasiness unto the unbelievers
Let me alone with him whom I have created
on whom I have bestowed abundant riches
and children dwelling in his presence
and for whom I have disposed affairs in a smooth and easy manner
and who desireth that I will yet add other blessings unto him
By no means: Because he is an adversary to our signs
I will afflict him with grievous calamities
For he hath devised and prepared contumelious expressions to ridicule the Koran
May he be cursed: How maliciously hath he prepared the same
And again, may he be cursed: How maliciously hath he prepared the same
Then he looked
and frowned, and put on an austere countenance
Then he turned back, and was elated with pride
and he said, this is no other than a piece of magic, borrowed from others
These are only the words of a man
I will cast him to be burned in hell
And what shall make thee to understand what hell is
It leaveth not any thing unconsumed, neither doth it suffer any thing to escape
It scorcheth mens flesh
Over the same are nineteen angels appointed
We have appointed none but angels to preside over hell fire: And we have expressed the number of them only for an occasion of discord to the unbelievers; that they to whom the scriptures have been given, may be certain of the veracity of this book, and the true believers may increase in faith; and that those to whom the scriptures have been given, and the true believers may not doubt hereafter; and that those in whose hearts there is an infirmity, and the unbelievers may say, what mystery doth God intend by this number? Thus doth God cause to err whom He pleaseth; and He directeth whom He pleaseth. None knoweth the armies of thy Lord, besides Him: And this is no other than a memento unto mankind. Assuredly
By the moon
and the night when it retreateth
and the morning when it reddeneth
I swear that this is one of the most terrible calamities
giving warning unto men
as well unto him among you who desireth to go forward, as unto him who chooseth to remain behind
Every soul is given in pledge for that which it shall have wrought
Except the companions of the right hand
who shall dwell in gardens, and shall ask one another questions
concerning the wicked
and shall also ask the wicked themselves, saying, what hath brought you into hell
They shall answer, we were not of those who were constant at prayer
neither did we feed the poor
and we waded in vain disputes, with the fallacious reasoners
and we denied the day of judgment
until death overtook us
And the intercession of the interceders shall not avail them
What aileth them, therefore, that they turn aside from the admonition of the Koran
as though they were timorous asses
flying from a lion
But every man among them desireth that he may have expanded scrolls delivered to him from God
By no means. They fear not the life to come
By no means: Verily this is a sufficient warning
Whoso is willing to be warned, him shall it warn
But they shall not be warned, unless God shall please. He is worthy to be feared; and he is inclined to forgiveness
Verily I swear by the day of resurrection
and I swear by the soul which accuseth itself
Doth man think that We will not gather his bones together
Yea: We are able to put together the smallest bones of his fingers
But man chooseth to be wicked, for the time which is before him
He asketh, when will the day of resurrection be
But when the sight shall be dazzled
and the moon shall be eclipsed
and the sun and the moon shall be in conjunction
on that day man shall say, where is a place of refuge
By no means: There shall be no place to fly unto
With thy Lord shall be the sure mansion of rest on that day
On that day shall a man be told that which he hath done first and last
Yea; a man shall be an evidence against himself
And though he offer his excuses, they shall not be received
Move not thy tongue, O Mohammed, in repeating the revelations brought thee by Gabriel, before he shall have finished the same, that thou mayest quickly commit them to memory
For the collecting the Koran in thy mind, and the teaching thee the true reading thereof are incumbent on Us
But when We shall have read the same unto thee by the tongue of the angel, do thou follow the reading thereof
And afterwards it shall be our part to explain it unto thee
By no means shalt thou be thus hasty for the future. But ye love that which hasteneth away
and neglect the life to come
Some countenances, on that day, shall be bright
looking towards their Lord
and some countenances, on that day, shall be dismal
They shall think that a crushing calamity shall be brought upon them
Assuredly. When a man's soul shall come up to his throat, in his last agony
and the standers-by shall say, who bringeth a charm to recover him
And shall think it to be his departure out of this world
and one leg shall be joined with the other leg
On that day unto thy Lord shall he be driven
For he believed not, neither did he pray
but he accused God's apostle of imposture, and turned back from obeying him
Then he departed unto his family, walking with a haughty mien
Wherefore, woe be unto thee; woe
And again, woe be unto thee; woe
Doth man think that he shall be left at full liberty, without control
Was he not a drop of seed, which was emitted
Afterwards he became a little coagulated blood; and God formed him, and fashioned him with just proportion
And made of him two sexes, the male and the female
Is not he who hath done this able to quicken the dead
Did there not pass over man a long space of time; during which he was a thing not worthy of remembrance
Verily we have created man of the mingled seed of both sexes, that We might prove him: And We have made him to hear and to see
We have surely directed him in the way; whether he be grateful, or ungrateful
Verily we have prepared for the unbelievers chains, and collars, and burning fire
But the just shall drink of a cup of wine, mixed with the water of Cafur
a fountain whereof the servants of God shall drink; they shall convey the same by channels whithersoever they please
These fulfil their vow, and dread the day, the evil whereof will disperse itself far abroad
and give food unto the poor, and the orphan, and the bondman, for his sake
saying, we feed you for God's sake only: We desire no recompense from you, nor any thanks
Verily we dread, from our Lord, a dismal and calamitous day
Wherefore God shall deliver them from the evil of that day, and shall cast on them brightness of countenance, and joy
and shall reward them, for their patient persevering, with a garden, and silk garments
Therein shall they repose themselves on couches; they shall see therein neither sun nor moon
and the shades thereof shall be near spreading above them, and the fruits thereof shall hang low, so as to be easily gathered
And their attendants shall go round about unto them, with vessels of silver, and goblets
The bottles shall be bottles of silver shining like glass; they shall determine the measure thereof by their wish
And therein shall they be given to drink of a cup of wine, mixed with the water of Zenjebil
a fountain in paradise named Salsabil
And youths, which shall continue for ever in their bloom, shall go round to attend them; when thou seest them, thou shalt think them to be scattered pearls
And when thou lookest, there shalt thou behold delights, and a great kingdom
Upon them shall be garments of fine green silk, and of brocades, and they shall be adorned with bracelets of silver: And their Lord shall give them to drink of a most pure liquor
and shall say unto them, verily this is your reward: And your endeavour is gratefully accepted
Verily We have sent down unto thee the Koran, by a gradual revelation
Wherefore patiently wait the judgment of thy Lord; and obey not any wicked person or unbeliever among them
And commemorate the name of thy Lord, in the morning, and in the evening
And during some part of the night worship Him, and praise Him a long part of the night
Verily these men love the transitory life, and leave behind them the heavy day of judgment
We have created them, and have strengthened their joints; and when We please, We will substitute others like unto them, in their stead
Verily this is an admonition: And whoso willeth, taketh the way unto his Lord
But ye shall not will, unless God willeth; for God is knowing, and wise
He leadeth whom He pleaseth into his mercy: But for the unjust hath He prepared a grievous punishment
By the angels which are sent by God, following one another in a continual series; and those which move swiftly
with a rapid motion
and by those which disperse his commands, by divulging them through the earth
and by those which separate truth from falsehood, by distinguishing the same
and by those which communicate the divine admonitions
to excuse, or to threaten
Verily that which ye are promised is inevitable
When the stars, therefore, shall be put out
and when the heaven shall be cloven in sunder
and when the mountains shall be winnowed
and when the apostles shall have a time assigned them to appear and bear testimony against their respective people
to what a day shall that appointment be deferred
To the day of separation
And what shall cause thee to understand what the day of separation is
On that day, woe be unto them who accused the prophets of imposture
Have We not destroyed the obstinate unbelievers of old
We will also cause those of the latter times to follow them
Thus do We deal with the wicked
Woe be, on that day, unto them who accused the prophets of imposture
Have We not created you of a contemptible drop of seed
which We placed in a sure repository
until the fixed term of delivery
And We were able to do this: For We are most powerful
On that day, woe be unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
Have We not made the earth to contain
the living and the dead
and placed therein stable and lofty mountains, and given you fresh water to drink
Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
It shall be said unto them, go ye to the punishment which ye denied as a falsehood
Go ye into the shadow of the smoke of hell, which shall ascend in three columns
and shall not shade you from the heat, neither shall it be of service against the flame
but it shall cast forth sparks as big as towers
resembling yellow camels in colour
Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose
neither shall they be permitted to excuse themselves
Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
This shall be the day of separation: We will assemble both you and your predecessors
Whereofore, if ye have any cunning stratagem, employ stratagems against Me
Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
But the pious shall dwell amidst shades and fountains
and fruits of the kinds which they shall desire
And it shall be said unto them, eat and drink with easy digestion, in recompense for that which ye have wrought
for thus do We reward the righteous doers
Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
Eat, O unbelievers, and enjoy the pleasures of this life, for a little while: Verily ye are wicked men
Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
And when it is said unto them, bow down; they do not bow down
Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
In what new revelation will they believe, after this
Concerning what do the unbelievers ask questions of one another
Concerning the great news of the resurrection
about which they disagree
Assuredly they shall hereafter know the truth thereof
Again, assuredly they shall hereafter know the truth thereof
Have We not made the earth for a bed
and the mountains for stakes to fix the same
And have We not created you of two sexes
and appointed your sleep for rest
and made the night a garment to cover you
and destined the day to the gaining your livelihood
and built over you seven solid heavens
and placed therein a burning lamp
And do We not send down from the clouds pressing forth rain, water pouring down in abundance
that We may thereby produce corn, and herbs
and gardens planted thick with trees
Verily the day of separation is a fixed period
The day whereon the trumpet shall sound, and ye shall come in troops to judgment
and the heaven shall be opened, and shall be full of gates for the angels to pass through
and the mountains shall pass away, and become as a vapour
verily hell shall be a place of ambush
a receptacle for the transgressors
who shall remain therein for ages
They shall not taste any refreshment therein, or any drink
except boiling water, and filthy corruption
A fit recompense for their deeds
For they hoped that they should not be brought to an account
and they disbelieved our signs, accusing them of falsehood
But every thing have We computed, and written down
Taste, therefore: We will not add unto you any other than torment
But for the pious is prepared a place of bliss
Gardens planted with trees, and vineyards
and damsels with swelling breasts, of equal age with themselves
and a full cup
They shall hear no vain discourse there, nor any falsehood
This shall be their recompense from thy Lord; a gift fully sufficient
From the Lord of heaven and earth, and of whatever is between them; the Merciful. The inhabitants of heaven or of earth shall not dare to demand audience of Him
The day whereon the spirit Gabriel, and the other angels shall stand in order, they shall not speak in behalf of themselves or others, except he only to whom the Merciful shall grant permission, and who shall say that which is right
This is the infallible day. Whoso, therefore, willeth, let him return unto his Lord
Verily We threaten you with a punishment nigh at hand: The day whereon a man shall behold the good or evil deeds which his hands have sent before him; and the unbeliever shall say, would to God I were dust
By the angels who tear forth the souls of some with violence
and by those who draw forth the souls of others with gentleness
by those who glide swimmingly through the air with the commands of God
and those who precede and usher the righteous to paradise
and those who subordinately govern the affairs of this world
On a certain day, the disturbing blast of the trumpet shall disturb the universe
and the subsequent blast shall follow it
On that day men's hearts shall tremble
Their looks shall be cast down
The infidels say, shall we surely be made to return whence we came
After we shall have become rotten bones, shall we be again raised to life
They say, this then will be a return to loss
Verily it will be but one sounding of the trumpet
and behold, they shall appear alive on the face of the earth
Hath not the story of Moses reached thee
When his Lord called unto him in the holy valley Towa, saying
go unto Pharaoh; for he is insolently wicked
and say, hast thou a desire to become just and holy
And I will direct thee unto thy Lord, that thou mayest fear to transgress
And he shewed him the very great sign of the rod turned into a serpent
But he charged Moses with imposture, and rebelled against God
Then he turned back hastily
and he assembled the magicians, and cried aloud, saying
I am your supreme Lord
Wherefore God chastised him with the punishment of the life to come, and also of this present life
Verily herein is an example unto him who feareth to rebel
Are ye more difficult to create, or the heaven which God hath built
He hath raised the height thereof, and hath perfectly formed the same
And He hath made the night thereof dark, and hath produced the light thereof
After this, He stretched out the earth
whence He caused to spring forth the water thereof, and the pasture thereof
and He established the mountains
for the use of yourselves, and of your cattle
When the prevailing, the great day shall come
on that day shall a man call to remembrance what he hath purposely done
And hell shall be exposed to the view of the spectator
And whoso shall have transgressed
and shall have chosen this present life
verily hell shall be his abode
But whoso shall have dreaded the appearing before his Lord, and shall have refrained his soul from lust
verily paradise shall be his abode
They will ask thee concerning the last hour, when will be the fixed time thereof
By what means canst thou give any information of the same
Unto thy Lord belongeth the knowledge of the period thereof
And thou art only a warner, who fearest the same
The day whereon they shall see the same, it shall seem to them as though they had not tarried in the world longer than an evening, or a morning thereof
The prophet frowned, and turned aside
because the blind man came unto him
And how dost thou know whether he shall peradventure be cleansed from his sins
or whether he shall be admonished, and the admonition shall profit him
The man who is wealthy
thou receivest respectfully
whereas it is not to be charged on thee, that he is not cleansed
But him who cometh unto thee earnestly seeking his salvation
and who feareth God
dost thou neglect
By no means shouldest thou act thus
Verily the Koran is an admonition; -- and he who is willing retaineth the same
written in volumes honourable
exalted, and pure
by the hands of scribes honoured
and just
May man be cursed! What hath seduced him to infidelity
Of what thing doth God create him
Of a drop of seed doth He create him; and He formeth him with proportion
and then facilitateth his passage out of the womb
Afterwards He causeth him to die, and layeth him in the grave
hereafter, when it shall please Him, He shall raise him to life
Assuredly. He hath not hitherto fully performed what God hath commanded him
Let man consider his food; in what manner it is provided
We pour down water by showers
afterwards We cleave the earth in clefts
and We cause corn to spring forth therein
and grapes, and clover
and the olive, and the palm
and gardens planted thick with trees
and fruits, and grass
for the use of yourselves and of your cattle
When the stunning sound of the trumpet shall be heard
on that day shall a man fly from his brother
and his mother, and his father
and his wife, and his children
Every man of them, on that day, shall have business of his own sufficient to employ his thoughts
On that day the faces of some shall be bright
laughing, and joyful
And upon the faces of others, on that day, shall there be dust
darkness shall cover them
These are the unbelievers, the wicked
When the sun shall be folded up
and when the stars shall fall
and when the mountains shall be made to pass away
and when the camels ten months gone with young shall be neglected
and when the wild beasts shall be gathered together
and when the seas shall boil
and when the souls shall be joined again to their bodies
and when the girl who hath been buried alive shall be asked
for what crime she was put to death
and when the books shall be laid open
and when the heaven shall be removed
and when hell shall burn fiercely
and when paradise shall be brought near
Every soul shall know what it hath wrought
Verily I swear by the stars which are retrograde
which move swiftly, and which hide themselves
and by the night, when it cometh on
and by the morning, when it appeareth
that these are the words of an honourable messenger
endued with strengeth, of established dignity in the sight of the possessor of the throne
obeyed by the angels under his authority, and faithful
And your companion Mohammed is not distracted
He had already seen him in the clear horizon
And he suspected not the secrets revealed unto him
Neither are these the words of an accursed devil
Whither, therefore, are ye going
This is no other than an admonition unto all creatures
unto him among you who shall be willing to walk uprightly
But ye shall not will, unless God willeth, the Lord of all creatures
When the heaven shall be cloven in sunder
and when the stars shall be scattered
and when the seas shall be suffered to join their waters
and when the graves shall be turned upside down
Every soul shall know what it hath committed, and what it hath omitted
O man, what hath seduced thee against thy gracious Lord
who hath created thee, and put thee together
and rightly disposed thee? In what form He pleased hath He fashioned thee
Assuredly. But ye deny the last judgment as a falsehood
Verily there are appointed over you guardian angels
honourable in the sight of God, writing down your actions
who know that which ye do
The just shall surely be in a place of delight
But the wicked shall surely be in hell
they shall be cast therein to be burned, on the day of judgment
and they shall not be absent therefrom for ever
What shall cause thee to understand what the day of judgment is
Again, what shall cause thee to understand what the day of judgment is
It is a day whereon one soul shall not be able to obtain any thing in behalf of another soul: And the command, on that day, shall be God's
Woe be unto those who give short measure or weight
who, when they receive by measure from other men, take the full
but when they measure unto them, or weigh unto them, defraud
Do not these think they shall be raised again
at the great day
the day whereon mankind shall stand before the Lord of all creatures
By no means. Verily the register of the actions of the wicked is surely in Sejjin
And what shall make thee to understand what Sejjin is
It is a book distinctly written
Woe be, on that day, unto those who accused the prophets of imposture
who denied the day of judgment as a falsehood
And none denieth the same as falsehood, except every unjust and flagitious person
Who, when our signs are rehearsed unto him, saith, they are fables of the ancients
By no means: But rather their lusts have cast a veil over their hearts
By no means. Verily they shall be shut out from their Lord on that day
and they shall be sent into hell to be burned
Then shall it be said unto them, by the infernal guards, this is what ye denied as a falsehood
Assuredly. But the register of the actions of the righteous is in Illiyyun
And what shall cause thee to understand what Illiyyun is
It is a book distinctly written
Those who approach near unto God, are witnesses thereto
Verily the righteous shall dwell among delights
Seated on couches they shall behold objects of pleasure
thou shalt see in their faces the brightness of joy
They shall be given to drink of pure wine, sealed
the seal whereof shall be musk: And to this let those aspire, who aspire to happiness
And the water mixed therewith shall be of Tasnim
a fountain whereof those shall drink who approach near unto the divine presence
They who act wickedly laugh the true believers to scorn
and when they pass by them, they wink at one another
And when they turn aside to their people, they turn aside making scurrilous jests
And when they see them, they say, verily these are mistaken men
But they are not sent to be keepers over them
Wherefore one day the true believers, in their turn, shall laugh the infidels to scorn
Lying on couches they shall look down upon them in hell
Shall not the infidels be rewarded for that which they have done
When the heaven shall be rent in sunder
and shall obey its Lord, and shall be capable thereof
and when the earth shall be stretched out
and shall cast forth that which is therein, and shall remain empty
and shall obey its Lord, and shall be capable thereof
O man, verily labouring thou labourest to meet thy Lord, and thou shalt meet Him
And he who shall have his book given into his right hand
shall be called to an easy account
and shall turn unto his family with joy
But he who shall have his book given him behind his back
shall invoke destruction to fall upon him
and he shall be sent into hell to be burned
because he rejoiced insolently amidst his family on earth
Verily he thought that he should never return unto God
Yea verily; but his Lord beheld him
Wherefore I swear by the redness of the sky after sun-set
and by the night, and the animals which it driveth together
and by the moon when she is at the full
ye shall surely be transferred successively from state to state
What aileth them, therefore, that they believe not the resurrection
and that, when the Koran is read unto them, they worship not
Yea: The unbelievers accuse the same of imposture
But God well knoweth the malice which they keep hidden in their breasts
Wherefore denounce unto them a grievous punishment
except those who believe and do good works: For them is prepared a never failing reward
By the heaven adorned with signs
by the promised day of judgment
by the witness, and the witnessed
cursed were the contrivers of the pit
of fire supplied with fuel
when they sat round the same
and were witnesses of what they did against the true believers
And they afflicted them for no other reason, but because they believed in the mighty, the glorious God
unto whom belongeth the kingdom of heaven and earth: And God is witness of all things
Verily for those who persecute the true believers of either sex, and afterwards repent not, is prepared the torment of hell; and they shall suffer the pain of burning
But for those who believe, and do that which is right, are destined gardens beneath which rivers flow: This shall be great felicity
Verily the vengeance of thy Lord is severe
He createth, and He restoreth to life
He is inclined to forgive, and gracious
The possessor of the glorious throne
who effecteth that which He pleaseth
Hath not the story of the hosts
of Pharaoh, and of Thamud, reached thee
Yet the unbelievers cease not to accuse the divine revelations of falsehood
But God encompasseth them behind, that they cannot escape
Verily that which they reject is a glorious Koran
the original whereof is written in a table kept in heaven
By the heaven, and that which appeareth by night
But what shall cause thee to understand what that which appeareth by night is
It is the star of piercing brightness
Every soul hath a guardian set over it
Let a man consider, therefore, of what he is created
He is created of seed poured forth
issuing from the loins, and the breast-bones
Verily God is able to restore him to life
the day whereon all secret thoughts and actions shall be examined into
and he shall have no power to defend himself, nor any protector
By the heaven which returneth the rain
and by the earth which openeth to let forth vegetables and springs
Verily this is a discourse distinguishing good from evil
and it is not composed with lightness
Verily the infidels are laying a plot to frustrate my designs
But I will lay a plot for their ruin
Wherefore, O prophet, bear with the unbelievers: Let them alone a while
Praise the name of thy Lord, the most high
Who hath created, and completely formed his creatures
And Who determineth them to various ends, and directeth them to attain the same
and who produceth the pasture for cattle
and afterwards rendereth the same dry stubble of a dusky hue
We will enable thee to rehearse our revelations; and thou shalt not forget any part thereof
except what God shall please; for He knoweth that which is manifest, and that which is hidden
And We will facilitate unto thee the most easy way
Wherefore admonish thy people, if thy admonition shall be profitable unto them
Whoso feareth God, he will be admonished
But the most wretched unbeliever will turn away therefrom
who shall be cast to be broiled in the greater fire of hell
wherein he shall not die, neither shall he live
Now hath he attained felicity who is purified by faith
and who remembereth the name of his Lord, and prayeth
But ye prefer this present life
Yet the life to come is better, and more durable
Verily this is written in the ancient books
the books of Abraham and Moses
Hath the news of the overwhelming day of judgment reached thee
The countenances of some, on that day, shall be cast down
labouring and toiling
They shall be cast into scorching fire to be broiled
They shall be given to drink of a boiling fountain
They shall have no food, but of dry thorns and thistles
which shall not fatten, neither shall they satisfy hunger
But the countenances of others, on that day, shall be joyful
well pleased with their past endeavour
They shall be placed in a lofty garden
wherein thou shalt hear no vain discourse
Therein shall be a running fountain
Therein shall be raised beds
and goblets placed before them
and cushions laid in order
and carpets ready spread
Do they not consider the camels, how they are created
and the heaven, how it is raised
and the mountains, how they are fixed
and the earth, how it is extended
Wherefore warn thy people; for thou art a warner only
Thou art not impowered to act with authority over them
But whoever shall turn back, and disbelieve
God shall punish him with the greater punishment of the life to come
Verily unto us shall they return
Then shall it be our part to bring them to account
By the day-break
and then nights
by that which is double, and that which is single
and by the night when it cometh on
Is there not in this an oath formed with understanding
Hast thou not considered how thy Lord dealt with Ad
the people of Irem, adorned with lofty buildings
the like whereof hath not been erected in the land
and with Thamud, who hewed the rocks in the valley into houses
and with Pharaoh, the contriver of the stakes
Who had behaved insolently in the earth
and multiplied corruption therein
Wherefore thy Lord poured on them various kinds of chastisement
For thy Lord is surely in a watch-tower, whence He observeth the actions of men
Moreover man, when his Lord trieth him by prosperity, and honoureth him, and is bounteous unto him, saith, my Lord honoureth me
But when He proveth him by afflictions, and withholdeth his provisions from him, he saith, my Lord despiseth me
By no means: But ye honour not the orphan
neither do ye excite one another to feed the poor
and ye devour the inheritance of the weak, with undistinguishing greediness
and ye love riches, with much affection
By no means should ye do thus. When the earth shall be minutely ground to dust
and thy Lord shall come, and the angels rank by rank
and hell, on that day, shall be brought nigh: On that day shall man call to remembrance his evil deeds; but how shall remembrance avail him
He shall say, would to God that I had heretofore done good works in my life-time
On that day none shall punish with his punishment
nor shall any bind with his bonds
O thou soul which art at rest
return unto thy Lord, well pleased with thy reward, and well pleasing unto God
Enter among my servants
and enter my paradise
I swear by this territory
and thou, O prophet, residest in this territory
and by the begetter, and that which He hath begotten
verily We have created man in misery
Doth he think that none shall prevail over him
He saith, I have wasted plenty of riches
Doth he think that none seeth him
Have we not made him two eyes
and a tongue, and two lips
and shewn him the two highways of good and evil
Yet he attempteth not the cliff
What shall make thee to understand what the cliff is
It is to free the captive
or to feed, in the day of famine
the orphan who is of kin
or the poor man who lieth on the ground
Whoso doth this, and is one of those who believe, and recommend perseverance unto each other, and recommend mercy unto each other
these shall be the companions of the right-hand
But they who shall disbelieve our signs, shall be the companions of the left-hand
Above them shall be arched fire
By the sun, and its rising brightness
by the moon, when she followeth him
by the day, when it sheweth his splendor
by the night, when it covereth him with darkness
by the heaven, and Him who built it
by the earth, and Him who spread it forth
by the soul, and Him who completely formed it
and inspired into the same its faculty of distinguishing, and power of choosing, wickedness and piety
Now is he who hath purified the same, happy
but he who hath corrupted the same, is miserable
Thamud accused their prophet Saleh of imposture, through the excess of their wickedness
When the wretch among them was sent to slay the camel
and the apostle of God said unto them, let alone the camel of God; and hinder not her drinking
But they charged him with imposture; and they slew her. Wherefore their Lord destroyed them, for their crime, and made their punishment equal unto them all
And he feareth not the issue thereof
By the night, when it covereth all things with darkness
by the day, when it shineth forth
by Him who hath created the male, and the female
Verily your endeavour is different
Now whoso is obedient, and feareth God
and professeth the truth of that faith which is most excellent
unto him will We facilitate the way to happiness
But whoso shall be covetous, and shall be wholly taken up with this world
and shall deny the truth of that which is most excellent
unto him will We facilitate the way to misery
and his riches shall not profit him, when he shall fall headlong into hell
Verily unto Us appertaineth the direction of mankind
And ours is the life to come, and the present life
Wherefore I threaten you with fire which burneth fiercely
which none shall enter to be burned except the most wretched
who shall have disbelieved, and turned back
But he who strictly bewareth idolatry and rebellion, shall be removed far from the same
who giveth his substance in alms
and by whom no benefit is bestowed on any, that it may be recompensed
but who bestoweth the same for the sake of his Lord, the most High
And hereafter he shall be well satisfied with his reward
By the brightness of the morning
and by the night, when it groweth dark
Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither doth He hate thee
Verily the life to come shall be better for thee than this present life
And thy Lord shall give thee a reward wherewith thou shalt be well pleased
Did He not find thee an orphan, and hath He not taken care of thee
And did He not find thee wandering in error, and hath He not guided thee into the truth
And did He not find thee needy, and hath He not enriched thee
Wherefore oppress not the orphan
neither repulse the beggar
But declare the goodness of thy Lord
Have We not opened thy breast
and eased thee of thy burden
which galled thy back
and raised thy reputation for thee
Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease
Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease
When thou shalt have ended thy preaching, labour to serve God in return for his favours
and make thy supplication unto thy Lord
By the fig, and the olive
and by mount Sinai
and this territory of security
Verily We created man of a most excellent fabric
afterwards We rendered him the vilest of the vile
Except those who believe, and work righteousness; for they shall receive an endless reward
What therefore shall cause thee to deny the day of judgment after this
Is not God the most wise judge
Read, in the name of thy Lord, Who hath created all things
who hath created man of congealed blood
Read, by thy most beneficent Lord
Who taught the use of the pen
Who teacheth man that which he knoweth not
Assuredly. Verily man becometh insolent
because he seeth himself abound in riches
Verily unto thy Lord shall be the return of all
What thinkest thou as to him
who forbiddeth our servant, when he prayeth
What thinkest thou; if he follow the right direction
or command piety
What thinkest thou; if he accuse the divine revelations of falsehood, and turn his back
Doth he not know that God seeth
Assuredly. Verily, if he forbear not, We will drag him by the forelock
the lying, sinful forelock
And let him call his council to his assistance
We also will call the infernal guards to cast him into hell
Assuredly. Obey him not: But continue to adore God; and draw nigh unto Him
Verily We sent down the Koran in the night of al Kadr
And what shall make thee understand how excellent the night of al Kadr is
The night of al Kadr is better than a thousand months
Therein do the angels descend, and the spirit Gabriel also, by the permission of their Lord, with his decrees concerning every matter
It is peace, until the rising of the morn
The unbelievers among those to whom the scriptures were given, and among the idolaters, did not stagger, until the clear evidence had come unto them
An apostle from God, rehearsing unto them pure books of revelations
wherein are contained right discourses
Neither were they unto whom the scriptures were given divided among themselves, until after the clear evidence had come unto them
And they were commanded no other in the scriptures than to worship God, exhibiting unto him the pure religion, and being orthodox; and to be constant at prayer, and to give alms: And this is the right religion
Verily those who believe not, among those who have received the scriptures, and among the idolaters, shall be cast into the fire of hell, to remain therein for ever. These are the worst of creatures
But they who believe, and do good works; these are the best of creatures
Their reward with their Lord shall be gardens of perpetual abode, through which rivers flow; they shall remain therein for ever. God will be well pleased in them; and they shall be well pleased in him. This is prepared for him who shall fear his Lord
When the earth shall be shaken by an earthquake
and the earth shall cast forth her burdens
and a man shall say, what aileth her
On that day the earth shall declare her tidings
for that thy Lord will inspire her
On that day men shall go forward in distinct classes, that they may behold their works
And whoever shall have wrought good of the weight of an ant, shall behold the same
And whoever shall have wrought evil of the weight of an ant, shall behold the same
By the war-horses which run swiftly to the battle, with a panting noise
and by those which strike fire, by dashing their hoofs against the stones
and by those which make a sudden incursion on the enemy early in the morning
and therein raise the dust
and therein pass through the midst of the adverse troops
Verily man is ungrateful unto his Lord
and he is witness thereof
And he is immoderate in the love of worldly good
Doth he not know, therefore, when that which is in the graves shall be taken forth
and that which is in men's breasts shall be brought to light
that their Lord will, on that day, be fully informed concerning them
The striking
What is the striking
And what shall make thee to understand how terrible the striking will be
On that day men shall be like moths scattered abroad
and the mountains shall become like carded wool of various colours driven by the wind
Moreover he whose balance shall be heavy with good works
shall lead a pleasing life
But as to him whose balance shall be light
his dwelling shall be the pit of hell
What shall make thee to understand how frightful the pit of hell is
It is a burning fire
The emulous desire of multiplying riches and children employeth you
until ye visit the graves
By no means should ye thus employ your time: Hereafter shall ye know your folly
Again, by no means: Hereafter shall ye know your folly
By no means: If ye knew the consequence hereof with certainty of knowledge, ye would not act thus
Verily ye shall see hell
Again, ye shall surely see it with the eye of certainty
Then shall ye be examined, on that day, concerning the pleasures with which ye have amused yourselves in this life
By the afternoon
verily man employeth himself in that which will prove of loss
Except those who believe, and do that which is right; and who mutually recommend the truth, and mutually recommend perseverance unto each other
Woe unto every slanderer, and backbiter
Who heapeth up riches, and prepareth the same for the time to come
He thinketh that his riches will render him immortal
By no means. He shall surely be cast into al Hotama
And what shall cause thee to understand what al Hotama is
It is the kindled fire of God
which shall mount above the hearts of those who shall be cast therein
Verily it shall be as an arched vault above them
on columns of vast extent
Hast thou not seen how thy Lord dealt with the masters of the elephant
Did He not make their treacherous design an occasion of drawing them into error
and send against them flocks of birds
which cast down upon them stones of baked clay
and render them like the leaves of corn eaten by cattle
For the uniting of the tribe of Koreish
their uniting in sending forth the caravan of merchants and purveyors in winter and summer
Let them serve the Lord of this house
who supplieth them with food against hunger, and hath rendered them secure from fear
What thinkest thou of him who denieth the future judgment as a falsehood
It is he who pusheth away the orphan
and stirreth not up others to feed the poor
Woe be unto those who pray
and who are negligent at their prayer
who play the hypocrites
and deny necessaries to the needy
Verily we have given thee al Cawthar
Wherefore pray unto thy Lord, and slay the victims
verily he who hateth thee shall be childless
Say: O unbelievers
I will not worship that which ye worship
nor will ye worship that which I worship
Neither do I worship that which ye worship
neither do ye worship that which I worship
Ye have your religion, and I my religion
When the assistance of God shall come, and the victory
and thou shalt see the people enter into the religion of God by troops
Celebrate the praise of thy Lord, and ask pardon of Him; for He is inclined to forgive
The hands of Abu Laheb shall perish, and he shall perish
His riches shall not profit him, neither that which he hath gained
He shall go down to be burned into flaming fire
and his wife also, bearing wood
having on her neck a cord of twisted fibres of a palm-tree
Say, God is one God
the eternal God
He begetteth not, neither is He begotten
And there is not any one like unto Him
Say, I fly for refuge unto the Lord of the day-break
that He may deliver me from the mischief of those things which He hath created
and from the mischief of the night, when it cometh on
and from the mischief of women blowing on knots
and from the mischief of the envious, when he envieth
Say, I fly for refuge unto the Lord of men
the King of men
the God of men
that He may deliver me from the mischief of the whisperer who slyly withdraweth
who whispereth evil suggestions into the breasts of men
from genii and men
