1|1|In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
1|2|All Praise belongs to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds
1|3|The Beneficent, the Merciful
1|4|The Ruler of the Day of Judgment
1|5|Thee alone we serve and Thee alone we ask for aid

1|7|The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not of those who earn Thy wrath; nor of those who go astray
2|1|ALIF LAM MIM
2|2|This is the Book! There is no doubt therein; a guide to the pious
2|3|Who believe in the unseen, and are steadfast in worship, and spend of what We have given them
2|4|Who believe in what is revealed to you (Muhammad), and what was revealed before you, and are sure of the Hereafter
2|5|These are guided by their Lord, and these are the successful
2|6|Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the same to them if you warn them or if you warn them not, they will not believe
2|7|Allah has set a seal upon their heart and on their hearing; and on their eyes is dimness, and for them is grievous woe
2|8|And there are those among men who say, "We believe in Allah and in the last day;" but they do not believe
2|9|They would deceive Allah and those who do believe; but they deceive only themselves and they do not perceive
2|10|In their heart is a sickness, and Allah has made them still more sick, and for them is grievous woe because they lied
2|11|And when it is said to them, "Do not evil in the earth," they say, "We do only what is right
2|12|Are not they the evildoers? And yet they do not perceive
2|13|And when it is said to them, "Believe as other men believe," they say, "Shall we believe as fools believe?" Are not they themselves the fools? And yet they do not know
2|14|And when they meet those who believe, they say, "We do believe;" but when they go aside with their devils, they say, "We are with you; we were but mocking
2|15|Allah shall mock at them and let them go on in their rebellion, blindly wandering on
2|16|Those who buy error for guidance, their traffic profits not, and they are not guided
2|17|Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindles a fire; and when it lights up all around, Allah goes off with their light, and leaves them in darkness that they cannot see
2|18|Deaf, dumb, blind, and they shall not return
2|19|Or like a storm-cloud from the sky, wherein is darkness and thunder and lightning; they put their fingers in their ears at the thunder-clap, for fear of death, for Allah encompasses the disbelievers
2|20|The lightning well-nigh snatches off their sight, whenever it shines for them they walk therein; but when it is dark for them they halt; and if Allah willed He would go off with their hearing and their sight; verily, Allah is mighty over all
2|21|O you folk! Serve (adore) your Lord (Guardian) who created you and those before you; per chance (or possibly) you may fear evil (learn righteousness)
2|22|Who made the earth for you a bed and the heaven a canopy; and sent down from heaven water, and brought forth therewith fruits for your sustenance; so make no peers (rivals) for Allah, when you know better
2|23|And if you are in doubt of what we have revealed unto Our servant, then bring a chapter like it, and call your witnesses other than Allah if you tell truth
2|24|But if you do it not - and you surely cannot - then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for disbelievers
2|25|But bear the glad tidings to those who believe and work righteousness, that for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow; whenever they are provided with fruit there from they say, "This is what we were provided with before," and they shall be
2|26|Behold! Allah does not disdain to set forth a similitude even of a gnat, or anything lower or higher; and as for those who believe, they know that it is truth from the Lord; but as for those who disbelieve, they say, "What is it that Allah means by t
2|27|Those who break Allah´s covenant after the fixing thereof, and cut asunder what Allah has ordered to be joined, and do evil in the earth, these it is who are losers
2|28|How can you disbelieve in Allah, when you were dead and He made you alive, and then He will cause you to die, and then make you alive again, and then to Him will you return
2|29|It is He who created for you all that is in the earth, and He designed the heavens also and fashioned (ordered) them as seven heavens; and He knows all things
2|30|And when your Lord said unto the angels, "I am about to place a Vicegerent (Agent, Successor, Inheritor) in the earth," they said, "Will you place therein one who will do evil therein and shed blood? While we celebrate Thy praise and glorif
2|31|And He taught Adam the Names (qualities), all of them; then He propounded them to the angels and said, "Declare to Me the names of these, if you are truthful
2|32|They said, "Glory be to Thee! No knowledge is ours but what Thou Thyself have taught us, verily, you are the Knower, the Wise
2|33|Said the Lord, "O Adam declare to them the Names;" and when he had declared to them the Names, He said, "Did I not say to you, I know the secrets of the heavens and of the earth, and I know what you reveal and what you conceal
2|34|And when we said to the angels, "Bow down before Adam," they bowed before him save only Iblis, who refused and was too proud and became one of the disbelievers
2|35|And we said, "O Adam dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise, and eat there from amply as you wish; but do not draw near this tree or you will be of the transgressors
2|36|But Satan made them backslide there from and drove them out from what they were in, and We said, "Go down, one of you the enemy of the other, and in the earth there is an abode and a provision for a time
2|37|And Adam obtained certain words (revelations) from his Lord, and He relented towards him, for He is the Relenting, the Compassionate
2|38|We said, "Go down there from altogether and per chance (or possibly) there may come from Me a Guidance, and whoever follows My Guidance, no fear is theirs, nor shall they grieve
2|39|But those who disbelieve, and call Our signs lies, they are the fellows of the Fire, they shall dwell therein for ever
2|40|O you children of Israel! Remember My favours which I have favoured you with; fulfil My Covenant and I will fulfil your covenant; therefore, fear Me
2|41|Believe in what I have revealed, verifying what you have got, and be not the first to disbelieve in it, and do not barter My signs for a little price, and keep your duty to Me
2|42|Cloak not truth with vanity and falsehood, nor knowingly hide the truth
2|43|Be steadfast in worship, give alms, and bow down with those who bow
2|44|Will you order men to piety and forget it yourselves? You read the Book, do you not then understand
2|45|Seek aid with patience and prayer, though it is a hard thing save for the humble
2|46|Who know that they will meet their Lord, and that to Him they are returning
2|47|O you children of Israel! Remember My favours which I have favoured you with, and that I have preferred you above all others in the world
2|48|Fear the day wherein no soul shall pay any recompense for another soul, nor shall intercession be accepted for it, nor shall compensation be taken from it, nor shall they be helped
2|49|When We saved you from Pharaoh´s people who sought to wreak evil and woe on you, slaughtering your sons and letting your women live; in that was a great trial for you from your Lord
2|50|When We divided for you the sea and saved you and drowned Pharaoh´s people while you looked on
2|51|When We treated with Moses forty nights, then you chose the calf after he had gone and you did wrong
2|52|Yet then We forgave you after that; perhaps you may be grateful
2|53|And remember when We gave Moses the Scriptures and the Criterion; you had a chance to be guided
2|54|And remember when Moses said to his people, "O my people! You have wronged yourselves in taking this calf; repent unto your Creator and kill the guilty yourselves; that will be better for you in your Creator´s eyes; and He relented towards you
2|55|And remember when you said to Moses, "O Moses! We will not believe in you until we see Allah manifestly," and the thunderbolt caught you while you yet looked on
2|56|Then We raised you up after your death; perhaps you may be grateful
2|57|And We overshadowed you with the cloud, and sent down the manna and the quails; "Eat of the good things we have given you." They did not wrong Us, but it was themselves they were wronging
2|58|And when We said, "Enter this city and eat there from as plentifully as you wish; and enter the gate worshipping and say "hittatun" (repentance and surrender to Allah). So will We pardon you your sins and give increase unto those who do rig
2|59|But those who did wrong changed it for another word than that which was said to them: and We sent down upon those who did wrong, wrath from heaven for that they had so sinned
2|60|When Moses, too, asked drink for his people and We said, "Strike with your staff the rock," and from it burst forth twelve springs; each tribe among them knew his drinking place. "Eat and drink of what Allah has provided, and transgress not
2|61|And when they said: "Moses, we cannot always bear one kind of food; pray then to your Lord to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its green herbs, its cucumbers, its garlic, its lentils, and its onions." Said He, "Do you ask what is
2|62|Verily, whether it be of those who believe, or those who are Jews or Christians or Sabaeans, whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day and acts aright, they have their reward with their Lord, and there is no fear for them, nor shall they grieve
2|63|And when We took a covenant with you and held the mountain over you; (saying) "Accept what We have brought you with strong will, and bear in mind what is therein, per chance (or possibly) you yet may fear
2|64|Then even after that did you turn aside, and were it not for Allah´s grace towards you and His mercy, you would have been of those who lose
2|65|You know also of those among you who transgressed upon the Sabbath, and how We said to them, "Be you (as) apes, despised and spurned
2|66|Thus We made them an example unto those who stood before them, and those who should come after them, and a warning unto those who fear Allah
2|67|And remember when Moses said to his people, "Allah bids you slaughter a heifer." they said, "Are you making a jest of us?" Said he, "I seek refuge with Allah from being one of the unwise
2|68|They said, "Then pray to your Lord for us to show us what she is to be." He answered, "He said it is a cow, not old, nor young, of middle age between the two; so do as you are bid
2|69|They said, "Pray now to your Lord to show us what her colour is to be." He answered, "He said it is a fawn-coloured heifer, intensely fawn, her colour delighting those who look upon her
2|70|Again they said, "Pray to your Lord to show us what she is to be; for cows appear the same to us; then we, if Allah will, shall be guided
2|71|He answered, "He said, it is a heifer, not broken in to plough the earth or irrigate the tilth, a sound one with no blemish on her." They said, "Now have you brought the truth." And they slaughtered her, though they came near leaving i
2|72|Remember when you slew a soul and disputed thereupon, and Allah brought forth that which you had hidden
2|73|Then We said, "Strike him with part of her (the heifer)." Thus Allah brings the dead to life and shows you His signs, that per chance (or possibly) you may understand
2|74|Yet were your heart hardened even after that, till they were as rocks or harder still, for verily, there are some rocks from which streams burst forth, and others burst asunder and water issues out, and others there are that sink down for fear of Allah; b
2|75|Do you hope that they should believe you when already a sect of them have heard the word of Allah and then perverted it knowingly after they had understood it
2|76|Behold, when they meet men of faith they say, "We believe," but when they meet in private they say, "Will you talk to them of what Allah has opened up (revealed) to you, that they may argue with you upon it before your Lord? Do you not ther
2|77|Do they not then know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they make known abroad
2|78|And some of them there are, illiterate folk, that know not the Book, but their own fancies, conjectures and idle tales
2|79|But woe to those who write out the Book with their own hands and say "This is from Allah"; to buy therewith a little price! And woe to them for what their hands have written, and woe to them for what they gain
2|80|And then they say, "Hell fire shall not touch us save for a few number of days." Say, "Have you taken a covenant with Allah?" but Allah breaks not His covenant. Or do you say of Allah that which you do not know
2|81|Nay, whoever gains an evil gain, and is encompassed by his sins, those are the fellows of the Fire, and they shall dwell therein for ever
2|82|But such as act aright, those are the fellows of Paradise, and they shall dwell therein for ever
2|83|And remember when We took from the children of Israel a covenant, saying, "Serve you none but Allah, and to your two parents show kindness, and to your kindred and the orphans and the needy, and speak to men kindly, and be steadfast in prayer, and gi
2|84|And remember when We took a covenant from you, "shed not your kinsman´s blood, nor turn your kinsmen out of their homes:" then did you confirm it and were witnesses thereto
2|85|Yet you were those who slay your kinsmen and turn a party out of their homes, and back each other up against them with sin and enmity. But if they come to you as captives you ransom them! - and yet it is as unlawful for you to turn them out. Do you then b
2|86|Those who have bought this worldly life with the price of the Hereafter, the torment shall not be lightened from them nor shall they be helped
2|87|We gave Moses the Book and We followed him up with other apostles, and We gave Jesus the son of Mary manifest signs and aided him with the Holy Spirit. Do you then, every time an apostle comes to you with what your souls love not, scorn him with pride, an
2|88|They say, "Our heart are wrappings (preserving Allah´s truth)" nay, Allah has cursed them in their unbelief, and few it is who do believe (or little it is they believe)
2|89|And when a Book came down from Allah confirming what they had with them, though they had before prayed for victory over the faithless, yet when that came to them, which they recognised, then they refused to believe it. Allah´s curse is on the faithl
2|90|For a miserable price have they sold their souls, in not believing what Allah has revealed, grudging because Allah sends down of His grace on whomsoever of His servants He will; and they have brought on themselves wrath after wrath and for the disbeliever
2|91|And when they are told to believe in what Allah has revealed, they say, "We believe in what has been revealed to us only;" but they disbelieve in all beside, although it is the truth confirming what they have. Say, "Why did you kill Allah&a
2|92|Moses came to you with manifest signs, then you took up with the calf when he had gone and did wrong
2|93|And remember when We took a covenant with you and raised the mountain (Sinai) over you, "Take what We have given you with resolution and hear (the Law);" they said, "We hear but disobey;" and they were made to drink (the sin of) the ca
2|94|Say, "If the abode with Allah is your s alone and not for mankind, then seek you for death if you are sincere
2|95|But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent on before them; but Allah is well acquainted with the wrong doers
2|96|Why, you will find them the greediest of men for life; even more than the idolaters; each one would fain live for a thousand years,- but he will not be reprieved from punishment by being allowed to live that long, for Allah sees what they do
2|97|Say, "Who is an enemy to Gabriel? For he has revealed to your heart, with Allah´s permission, confirmation of what had been before, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers
2|98|Who is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His apostles and Gabriel and Michael? - Verily, Allah is an enemy to the unbelievers
2|99|We have sent down to you conspicuous signs, and none will disbelieve therein except the perverse
2|100|Or every time they make a covenant, will a part of them repudiate it? Nay, most of them are faithless
2|101|And when there comes to them an apostle confirming what they have, a party of those who have received the Book repudiate Allah´s book, casting it behind their backs as though they did not know
2|102|And they follow that which the devils recited against Solomon´s kingdom;- it was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils who disbelieved, teaching men sorcery, and what has been revealed to the two angels, Harut and Marut, at Babylon, yet neithe

2|105|They who disbelieve, whether of those who have the Book or of the idolaters, would fain that no good were sent down to you from your Lord; but Allah especially favours with His mercy whom He will, for Allah is Lord of abounding Grace
2|106|Whatever verse We may annul or cause you to forget, We will bring a better one than it, or one like it; do you not know that Allah has power over all
2|107|Do you not know that Allah´s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? Nor have you besides Allah a patron or a helper
2|108|Do you wish to question your Messenger, as Moses was questioned in the past? But whoever takes disbelief in exchange for faith has erred from the Level Way (sawaa = even, smooth, symmetrical, proportionate, righteous, balanced, appropriate, relevant)
2|109|Many of those who have the Book would fain turn you back into infidelity after you have once believed, through selfish envy, after the truth has been made manifest to them; but pardon and shun them till Allah accomplishes His purpose; verily, Allah is mig

2|111|They say, "None shall enter Paradise save such as be Jews or Christians;" that is their vain desire. Say thou, "Bring your proofs, if you are speaking truth
2|112|Nay, whoever surrenders his face (his countenance, nature, honour, glory, cause, will, his whole self) to Allah, and does good, he shall have his reward from his Lord, and no fear shall be on them, and they shall not grieve
2|113|The Jews say, "The Christians base themselves on naught;" and the Christians say, "The Jews base themselves on naught"; and yet both read the (same) Book. They say the same things as those people say who know not; but Allah shall judge
2|114|But who is more unjust than he who forbids that His name should not be mentioned in the places for the worship of Allah, and who strives to ruin them? It is not fitting for such to enter into them except in fear. For them is disgrace in this world, and in

2|119|Verily, We have sent you with the truth, a bearer of good tidings and of warning, and you shall not be questioned as to the fellows of hell
2|120|The Jews will not be satisfied with you, nor yet the Christians, until you follow their creed. Say, "Allah´s guidance is the (sufficient, correct or only) guidance;" and if you were to follow their lusts (desires, prejudices, fantasies, su)
2|121|They to whom We have brought the Book and who read it as it should be studied, they are the ones that believe therein; and whoever rejects faith therein, it is they who are the losers
2|122|O children of Israel! Remember My favours which I bestowed on you, and that I have preferred you over the (other people of the) worlds
2|123|And fear the day when no soul shall pay a recompense for another soul, nor shall an equivalent be received there from, nor any intercession avail; and they shall not be helped
2|124|And remember when his Lord tried Abraham with words, and he fulfiled them, He said, "Verily, I will set you as an Imam (high priest, leader, model, example, guide) for the nations." Said he, "And of my seed also?" Allah said, "My

2|129|Our Lord! Send them an apostle of their own, to read to them Thy signs and teach them the Scripture and Wisdom, and to purify them; verily, you are the Mighty and the Wise
2|130|Who is averse from the religion of Abraham save one who is foolish of soul? For We have chosen him in this world, and in the Hereafter he is surely in the ranks of the righteous
2|131|Behold! His Lord said to him, "Surrender" he said, "I have surrendered unto the Lord of the worlds
2|132|And Abraham instructed his sons therein, and so did Jacob (saying), "O my sons! Verily, Allah has chosen for you the (true) religion, do not therefore die save as those who have surrendered (as Muslims)
2|133|Were you then witnesses when Jacob was facing death, when he said to his sons, "What will you serve when I am gone?" They said, "We will serve your God, the God of your fathers Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, one God; and unto Him have we

2|136|Say you "We believe in Allah, and what has been revealed to us, and what has been revealed to Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Tribes, and what was brought to Moses and Jesus, and what was brought unto the Prophets from their Lord

2|140|Do you say that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians? Say, "Do you know better than Allah? Ah! Who is more unjust than one who conceals a testimony that he has from Allah? But Allah is not unmindful of wh

2|143|Thus have We made you a middle (or justly balanced) nation, to be witnesses against men, and that the Apostle may be a witness against you. We have not appointed the Qiblah (direction, focus, goal) which you were used to, save that We might know (test) wh
2|144|We see you often turn your face towards the heavens, but We will surely turn you to a Qiblah you shall like. Turn then your face towards the Sacred Mosque (Kaaba in Mecca); wherever you are, turn your faces towards it; for verily, the People of the Book
2|145|And even if you should bring to the People of the Book every sign, they would not follow your Qiblah (direction, focus, goal); and you are not to follow their Qiblah; nor do some of them follow the Qiblah of the others: and if you follow their lusts (vain)
2|146|Those whom We have given the Book know this as they know their own sons, although a sect of them does surely hide the truth which they themselves know
2|147|The truth (is) from your Lord; be not, therefore, one of those who doubt
2|148|Every sect has a huwa (goal) to which Allah turns him; but do you strive onwards together to do good works; wherever you are Allah will bring you all together; verily, Allah has power over all things
2|149|From wherever you come forth, there turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, for it is surely truth from your Lord; Allah is not unmindful about what you do
2|150|And from wherever you come forth, there turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and wherever you are, turn your faces towards it, that men may have no argument against you, save only those of them who are bent on wickedness; and fear them not, but fear
2|151|Thus (similarly) have We sent amongst you an apostle from yourselves, to recite to you Our signs, to purify you and teach you the Book and wisdom, and to teach you what you did not know

2|159|Verily, those who hide what We have revealed of manifest Signs and of Guidance after We have manifested it to men in the Book, them Allah shall curse, and those entitled to curse shall curse them too
2|160|Save those who turn (repent) and make amends and openly declare the truth; these will I turn to again, for I am Oft-Relenting, Most Merciful
2|161|Verily, those who disbelieve (or reject faith) and die while still in disbelief, on them is the curse of Allah, and of the angels, and of all mankind
2|162|They will dwell therein (in the curse) for ever; the torment shall not be lightened for them, nor shall they have any respite

2|170|When it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has revealed," they say, "Nay, we will follow the way of our fathers." What! Even though their fathers had no sense (or wisdom) at all or guidance
2|171|The likeness of those who disbelieve (or reject faith) is as the likeness of him who shouts like a goat-herd, to that which hears him not, save only a call and a cry; deaf, dumb, and blind they are devoid of understanding

4|16|And if two of you commit it, then punish them both; but if they repent and amend, leave them alone, verily, Allah is easily Relenting, Merciful
4|17|Allah is only bound to forgive those who do evil through ignorance and then repent. Surely, these are the ones to whom Allah is relenting. Allah is Knower Wise
4|18|His forgiveness is not for those who do evil until death approaches and then he says, "Now I repent", nor yet for those who die faithless. For such We have prepared a grievous woe
4|19|O you who believe! It is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will; nor to restrain them so that you may take away part of what you gave them, unless they commit flagrant lewdness; but associate with them with kindness and equity, for if you

4|27|Allah wishes to turn towards you in mercy, but those who follow their own lusts (desires, prejudices, addictions, superstitions) wish that you should go far astray
4|28|Allah wishes to make the burden light for you, for man was created weak
4|29|O you who believe! Squander not your property amongst yourselves vainly, but use it in trade by mutual consent. And do not destroy yourselves (or kill one another); verily, Allah is ever Merciful unto you
4|30|But whoever does that maliciously and unjustly, we will broil him with Fire; for that is easy with Allah
4|31|If you avoid great sins from which you are forbidden, We will remit (or expel) your lesser offences (or all evil in you) and make you enter a noble gate
4|32|And do not covet that by which Allah has preferred one of you over another. The men shall have what they earn, and the women what they earn; but instead (of envy) ask Allah for His Bounty, verily, Allah is All-Knowing
4|33|To every one have we appointed sharers (heirs, kinfolk, partners) to property left by parents and relatives. And to those with whom you have joined right hands (made pledges, contracts, marriages), give them also their portion. For, verily, Allah is Witne

4|40|Verily, Allah would not wrong by the weight of an atom; and if it´s a good work, He will double it and bring from Himself a mighty reward
4|41|What if We bring from every nation a witness, and bring you as a witness against these
4|42|On the day when those who disbelieve and rebel against the Messenger would wish that they were levelled with the earth, but they cannot hide the facts from Allah

4|47|O you who have been given the Book! Believe in what We have revealed, confirming what you had before; ere we deface your faces and turn them into hinder parts, or curse you as we cursed the Sabbath-breakers. The command of Allah´s is always done
4|48|Verily, Allah pardons not associating anything with Him, but He pardons anything short of that, to whomsoever He pleases; but associating anything with Allah is to devise a mighty sin indeed
4|49|Do you not see those who pride themselves for sanctity? Nay, Allah sanctifies whom He will, and they shall not be wronged a straw
4|50|Behold, how they devise lies against Allah, and that is manifest sin enough

6|45|And the uttermost part of the people who did wrong were cut off. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds
6|46|Say, "Think you! If Allah should remove your hearing and your sight, and should set a seal upon your heart, who is god but Allah to restore it to you?" See how We expound the revelations unto them! Yet still they turn away
6|47|Say, "Think! If Allah´s punishment should come to you unawares or openly (expectedly), would any perish save the people who do wrong
6|48|We do not send our messengers save as heralds of glad tidings and of warning, and whoever believes and acts aright, there is no fear for them, and they shall not be grieved
6|49|But those who deny Our signs, torment shall afflict them, because they used to disobey
6|50|Say (O Muhammad), "I do not say unto you that mine are the treasuries of Allah, nor that I know the unseen, and I do not say unto you, I am an angel. I follow only that which is inspired in me." Say, "Is the blind man equal to him who sees
6|51|Admonish therewith those who fear that they shall be gathered unto their Lord; there is no patron for them but Him, and no intercessor, that per chance (or possibly) they may fear (avoid evil)
6|52|Repel not those who call upon their Lord in the morning and in the evening, seeking His Countenance (Face, Presence); they are not accountable to you in anything, and you are not accountable to them in anything. Repel them and you will be of the unjust
6|53|Thus did We try some of them by (or in comparison with) others, that they may say, "Are these those unto whom Allah has been gracious amongst us?" Does not Allah know those who give thanks
6|54|And when those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say, "Peace be on you! Allah hath prescribed for Himself mercy; verily, he among you who does evil in ignorance, and then repents and does right, verily, He is Forgiving and Merciful
6|55|Thus do We expound Our revelations, that the way of the sinners may be made plain
6|56|Say, "I am forbidden to worship those you call upon anything beside Allah." Say, "I will not follow your lusts (desires, prejudices, fantasies), for then would I err and not be of the rightly guided
6|57|Say, "I rely on a manifestation (proofs) from my Lord, which you deny. I have not with me that for which you are impatient. The decision is a matter for Allah alone, He declares the Truth and He is the best of Judges
6|58|Say, "If I had that for which you are impatient, then the matter between you and me would have been settled immediately. But Allah is best aware of the wrong-doers
6|59|With Him are the keys (and treasures) of the unseen. None knows them save He; He knows what is in the land and in the sea; and there falls not a leaf save that He knows it; nor a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor aught that is moist, nor aught that
6|60|He it is who gathers you to Himself at night, and knows what you have committed in the day; then He raises you up again, that your appointed time may be fulfiled; in the end unto Him is your return, and then will He inform you of the truth of what you hav
6|61|He is omnipotent over His servants; He sets guardians over you until, when death comes to any one of you, Our messengers receive him and they never fail their duty
6|62|Then are they returned to Allah, their true and just Sovereign. Is not His the judgment (or rule)? But He is the most swift at reckoning
6|63|Say, "Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and of the sea?" You call upon Him in humility and in secret, saying "Indeed, if He would rescue us from this, we will surely be of the thankful
6|64|Say, "Allah rescues from the darkness, and from every affliction, yet you associate others with Him
6|65|Say, "He is able to send calamities on you from above you and from beneath your feet, and to confuse you with dissenting sects, and to make you taste the violence of each other." See how We explain the Signs, in various ways that per chance (or)
6|66|Your people called it a lie, and yet it is the truth. Say, "I have not been put in charge over you
6|67|For every Announcement (Message, prophecy) there is a set term, and you will soon come to know it
6|68|When you see those who plunge deeply into vain discussion of Our Signs (revelations), turn away from them until they discuss another topic. It may be that Satan makes you forget, but sit not, after you have remembered, with the congregation of the faithle
6|69|Those who fear (or avoid evil, the righteous) are not accountable for them at all, but remind them (or give them the Reminder, i.e. the teachings of the Quran) that per chance (or possibly) they may learn to fear (Allah)
6|70|Leave alone (forsake, abandon) those who have taken their religion for a play (pastime) and a sport (jest, amusement), whom the life of the world has deceived, and remind them hereby lest a soul be destroyed by what it has earned. It has, beside Allah, no

6|74|Lo! Abraham said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols for gods? Verily, I see you and your people in obvious error
6|75|Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of heaven and of the earth, that he should be of those who possess certainty
6|76|And when the night overshadowed him he saw a star and said, "This is my Lord;" but when it set he said, "I love not those that set
6|77|And when he saw the moon beginning to rise he said, "This is my Lord;" but when it set he said, "If Allah my Lord guides me not I shall surely be of the people who err
6|78|And when he saw the sun beginning to rise he said, "This is my Lord, this is the greatest of all;" But when it set he said, "O my people! Verily, I am clear of what you associate with Allah
6|79|Verily, I have turned my face to Him who originated the heaven and the earth, as a ´Hanif´ (as one who is by nature upright), and I am not of the idolaters

6|82|It is those who believe and confuse not their faith with wrong, they are those who shall have security, and they are the rightly guided
6|83|These are our arguments which We gave to Abraham against his people. We raise whom We will by degrees of wisdom. Verily, your Lord is wise and Aware
6|84|And We gave to him Isaac and Jacob, each did We guide - And before him We guided Noah - and among his seed, David and Solomon and Job, Joseph, Moses and Aaron, - for thus do We reward those who do good
6|85|And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias, all righteous ones
6|86|And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonas and Lot, each one have We preferred above all creatures
6|87|With some of their forefathers and their offsprings and their brethren; We have chosen them and guided them into the Straight Way
6|88|Such is the Guidance of Allah wherewith He guides those whom He will of His servants; and if they associate (for worship) anything with Him, their works would have been in vain
6|89|It is to these We gave the Book and the Judgment and Prophethood. But if they disbelieve therein, then, indeed, We shall entrust it to a people who will not disbelieve. (See Matthew 8:11-12, Galatians)
6|90|It is these that Allah hath guided, and by their guidance be you led. Say (O Muhammad), "I ask of you no fee for it. Lo! It is naught save a reminder to the worlds
6|91|They estimate not the power of Allah by its true measure (or worth) when they say, "Allah has never revealed anything to a mortal." Say, "Who revealed the Book wherewith Moses came, a light and a guidance unto men? You put it on papers whic

6|93|Who is more wicked than he who devises against Allah a lie, or says, "I am inspired," when he has received none at all? And who says, "I can reveal the like of what Allah has revealed"? But did you see when the unjust are in the floods
6|94|And you come now alone as We created you at first, and you have left behind you that which We granted you; and We see not with you your intercessors whom you pretended were your partners amongst you; so between you have all ties been cut asunder; and that
6|95|Verily, Allah it is who splits the grain and the date-stone (for sprouting); He brings forth the living from the dead, and it is He who brings the dead from the living. Such is Allah! How then can you be deluded
6|96|He it is who cleaves out the morning, and makes night a repose, and the sun and the moon two reckonings (of Time). That is the decree of the Mighty, the Wise
6|97|He it is who made for you stars that you might be guided thereby in the darkness of the land and of the sea. Now have We detailed the signs unto a people who have knowledge
6|98|He it is who made you spring from one soul, and gave you a settlement and a depository (or a temporary and a permanent residence). Now have We detailed the signs unto a people who have discerning
6|99|He it is who sends down rain from the heavens; and We bring forth therewith growths of all kinds; and We bring forth there from green crops, from which We bring forth grain in full ear; and the palm, from its sheathes come clusters of dates within reach
6|100|Yet they made the Jinn equal with Allah, though He did create them! And they ascribed to Him sons and daughters, though they have no knowledge; Glory and all Praise be to Him! Exalted is He above what they attribute to Him
6|101|The Originator of the heavens and the earth! How can He have a son, when He has no female companion, and when He has created everything, and He is Aware of all things
6|102|That is Allah - your Lord! There is no Allah but He, the Creator of all things; so worship Him, for He takes care of all things
6|103|Vision comprehends Him not, but He comprehends all vision, for He is the Subtle, the Aware
6|104|Now has insight (or proof) come unto you from your Lord, and he who sees therewith it is for his own good; but he who is blind thereto, it is against his own soul. And I am not your keeper
6|105|Thus do We expound Our Signs in various ways, that they may say, "You have studied," and that We may make clear to those who have knowledge
6|106|Follow what is inspired in you from your Lord; there is no god but He, and shun the idolaters
6|107|But had Allah pleased, they would not have associated aught with Him. We have not made you a keeper over them, nor are you for them a warder (or responsible for them)
6|108|Revile (or abuse) not those who call on other than Allah, for then they may abuse Allah openly in their ignorance. Thus We make seemly to every nation their deeds. But unto their Lord is their return, and He will inform them of the truth of what they used
6|109|They swore by Allah with their strongest oaths, that if there come to them a Sign they will indeed believe therein. Say, ´Signs are only in Allah´s hands - but understand that even when one has come, they will not believe (or understanding is)
6|110|We confound their heart and their eyesight, even as they believed not at first, We will leave them, in their rebellion, blindly wandering on
6|111|And had We sent down unto them angels, or the dead had spoken to them, or We had gathered together the hosts before their very eyes, they would not have believed unless Allah so willed - but most of them are ignorant
6|112|So have We appointed for every Prophet an enemy - devils of men and Jinns; who inspire each other with seductive, deceptive speech which leads astray; but had your Lord willed they would not have done so. So leave them with what they do devise
6|113|And let the heart of those who believe not in the Hereafter listen to it; and let them be well pleased with it; and let them gain what they can gain
6|114|Shall I seek for Judge other than Allah, when it is He who has sent down to you this Book in detail? Those to whom We gave the Book know that it is sent down from your Lord, in truth. So, be not you of those who doubt
6|115|The words of your Lord are perfected (or fulfiled) in truth and justice. There is none to change His words, for He is Hearer and Knower
6|116|But if you follow most of those who are in the land, they will lead you astray from the Way of Allah. They follow naught but opinion (conjecture or suspicion) and they only guess
6|117|Your Lord, He knows best who errs from His path, and He knows best the rightly guided
6|118|Consume then of that over which Allah´s name has been pronounced, if you believe in His signs (or revelations)
6|119|Why should you not eat from that over which Allah´s name has been pronounced, when He has detailed unto you what is unlawful for you, unless you are compelled (or under necessity). But, verily, many are lead astray (or will lead you astray) by their

6|121|But consume not of that over which the name of Allah has not been pronounced, for, verily, it is an abomination. Verily, the devils inspire their friends to dispute with you. But if you obey them, then you will be, indeed, idolaters
6|122|Is he who was dead and We have quickened (given him life) him, and made for him a light, wherein walks amongst men, like him whose likeness is one walking in utter darkness whence he cannot emerge? Thus is their conduct made seemly to the disbelievers
6|123|And thus have We placed great ones (leaders) in every town, its wicked ones, that they may plot therein. But they do but plot against themselves, though they perceive not
6|124|And when there comes to them a Sign, they say, "We will not believe until we receive something like the Messenger received." Allah knows best where to put His Message. There shall befall these wicked ones, humiliation in Allah´s eyes, and
6|125|Whomever Allah wishes to guide, He expands His breast unto the Surrender (Islam); but whomever He wishes to lead astray, He tightens and constricts his breast as though he were climbing steeply into heaven. Thus does Allah set dishonour on those who do no
6|126|This is the way of your Lord, a Straight Way. We have detailed the revelations unto a mindful people
6|127|For them is an abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their patron because of what they used to do
6|128|One day He shall gather them all together, (and say) "O assembly of Jinns! You have taken much toll of (seduced, exploited) mankind." And their clients from among mankind shall say, "Our Lord! Much advantage had we one from another, but now
6|129|Thus do We make some of the wrongdoers patrons of one another, because of what they earn
6|130|O assembly of jinn and men! Did there not come to you Messengers of your own (or from amongst you), relating to you Our Signs, and warning you of the meeting of this Day? They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves." The life of this world
6|131|That is because your Lord would never destroy a township arbitrarily, while their people are unaware (of what is wrong)
6|132|There are ranks (levels, degrees) according to their deeds; and your Lord is not unaware of that which they do
6|133|your Lord is Absolute, Merciful; if He pleases He can remove you and can cause what He will to succeed you, even as He raised you up from the seed of other people
6|134|Verily, what you are promised will surely come to pass, nor can you frustrate it
6|135|Say (O Muhammad), "O my people! Work according to your power, verily, I, too, am working; and soon shall you come to know whose is the happy outcome in the Hereafter!" Certainly, the unjust shall not prosper
6|136|They set apart a portion for Allah, from that which He raises in abundance, of tilth and of cattle, and they say, according to their fancies "This is for Allah and this is for (His) partner." But the share of their "partners" reaches n
6|137|Even so, have their "partners" made seemly to many of the Pagans (idolaters), the killing of their children, leading them to their own destruction, and to the obscuration for them of their religion. If Allah willed they would not have done so. B

6|139|And they say, "What is in the wombs of these cattle is reserved for men and unlawful for our women, but if it be still born, then all may have shares in it." He will reward them for their superstitious attributions; verily, He is Wise and Aware
6|140|Losers are they who slay their children, from folly, without knowledge, and who forbid what Allah has bestowed upon them, inventing lies against Allah. They have, indeed erred and heeded not guidance
6|141|He it is who brought forth gardens with trailing and untrailing vines, and the palms and corn land, with various food, and olives, and pomegranates, alike and unlike. Eat from the fruit thereof whenever it fruits, and bring the dues thereof on the harvest

6|153|Verily, this is My Straight Way; so follow it. Follow not other ways, lest you part yourselves from His way. This is what He has ordained for you, per chance (or possibly) you may fear (and avoid evil)
6|154|Moreover, We gave Moses the Book, completing for him who would do right, and an explanation and a guidance and a mercy, that per chance (or possibly) they might believe in the meeting with their Lord
6|155|And this is the Book which We have revealed as a blessing; so follow it and fear (be righteous) that per chance (or possibly) you may obtain mercy

We will reward those who turn from our Signs with a severe punishment because of their turning

7|5|And their cry, when Our wrath came upon them, was only to say, "Verily, we were unjust (wrongdoers)

7|43|We will strip away what rancour (ill feeling) is in their breasts. There shall flow beneath them Rivers, and they shall say, "Praise belongs to Allah who guided us to this! For we should not have been led aright had not Allah guided us! Verily, the M
7|44|And the Companions of the Garden will call out to the Companions of the Fire, "We have now found that what our Lord promised us is true; have you also found that what your Lord promised you is true?" They will say, "Yea!" And a crier f
7|45|Who turn (or hinder) from the way of Allah and crave to make it crooked, and disbelieved in the Last Day (or the Hereafter)
7|46|And betwixt the two (Hell and Paradise) there is a veil, and on the Heights are men (exalted or able men) who know each by their marks; and they greet the companions of the Garden, "Peace be upon you!" They enter it not though they hope (or desi)
7|47|But when their sight is turned towards the Companions of the Fire, they say, "Our Lord! Place us not with the unjust people
7|48|And the Companions of the Height will call out to the men whom they know by their marks, and say, "Of what profit to you were your hoarding (of wealth), and what you were so arrogant about
7|49|Behold, are these others not those of whom you swore, that Allah would not extend mercy? But it is said to them "Enter you Paradise; there is no fear for you, nor shall you be grieved
7|50|But the Companions of the Fire cry out to the Companions of the Garden, "Pour out upon us water, or something of what Allah has provided you with (for sustenance, benefit or comfort)." They will say, "Allah has forbidden them both to those
7|51|Such who took their religion for an amusement, sport and a pastime; who were beguiled by the life of the world." This day have We forget them as they forgot the meeting of this Day, and because they did deny Our Signs
7|52|Now We have brought them a Book explaining it with knowledge, a guidance and a mercy to a people who believe
7|53|Do they just wait now for its fulfilment (or interpretation)? On the day when its fulfilment shall come, those who forgot it before will say, "Indeed, there did come to us the Messenger of our Lord in truth. Have we no intercessors now to intercede f
7|54|Verily, your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days; then mounted He the Throne (of Authority and Power). He covers night with the day - it pursues it incessantly- and the sun and the moon and the stars are subject to His command
7|55|Call on your Lord humbly and secretly, verily, He loves not the aggressors (the arrogant, the transgressors)
7|56|Work not confusion (chaos, mischief or evil) in the earth after it has been rightly ordered, and call upon Him with fear and hope (longing and earnestness); for, verily, the mercy of Allah is nigh unto those who do well
7|57|He it is who sends forth the winds like tidings heralding His mercy; until when they lift the heavy cloud which We drive to a dead land, and send down thereon water, and, thereby, bring forth every kind of fruit; - Thus do We bring forth the dead; per cha
7|58|And the good land brings forth its vegetation by the permission of its Lord; and that which is vile brings forth naught but sparsity (bad with little good). Thus do We expound Our signs for a people who are grateful
7|59|We did send Noah unto his people, and he said, "O my people I serve Allah; you have no God but Him; verily, I fear for you the torment of the mighty (awful) Day
7|60|Said the chiefs of his people, "Verily, we do surely see you in obvious error
7|61|Said he, "O my people! There is no error in me; but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds
7|62|I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and I give you sincere advice; and I know from Allah what you know not
7|63|Marvel you that there should come unto you a Reminder from your Lord by a man from amongst you, to warn you, that you may fear evil, and that per chance (or possibly) you may receive mercy
7|64|But they called him a liar, and We rescued him and those who were with him in the ark; and We drowned those who denied Our Signs. Verily, they were a blind people
7|65|And unto the people of Ad (we sent) their brother Hud, who said, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God save Him; What! Will you not then fear evil
7|66|The chiefs of his people, who disbelieved, said, "Verily, we see you in folly, and, verily, we certainly think you are of the liars
7|67|He said, "O my people! There is no folly in me; but I am a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds
7|68|I convey to you the messages of your Lord; and, verily, I am to you a faithful adviser
7|69|Marvel you then that there comes to you a Reminder from your Lord by a man from amongst you, to warn you? Remember when He made you vicegerents (or inheritors) after Noah´s people, and gave you growth of stature (prosperity, honour, excellence). Rem
7|70|They said, "Have you come to us that we may serve Allah alone, and forsake what our fathers used to worship? Then bring upon us what you threaten us with, if you are truthful
7|71|He said, "Already have fallen upon you from your Lord terror and wrath; do you wrangle with me about names, which you and your fathers have named yourselves, for which Allah sent down no warrant. Then wait expectant, lo! I, too, am of those waiting w
7|72|But We rescued him and those with him, by Our Mercy, and We cut off the roots of those who rejected Our signs and did not believe
7|73|Unto the people of Thamud We sent Salih, one of their own brethren. He said, "O my people! Serve (or worship) Allah; you have no God but Him. There has come to you a manifest Sign from your Lord. This is Allah´s she-camel, a sign (or test) unto
7|74|And remember how he made you vicegerents (agents, inheritors) after Ad and established you in the earth so that you took for yourselves castles on its plains and hewed out mountains into houses. So remember the bounties of Allah, and waste not the land, d
7|75|The chiefs from amongst his people, those who were inflated with pride, said to those whom they despised, those amongst them who believed, "Know you that Salih is sent from his Lord?" They said, "We do believe in that with which he is sent
7|76|The arrogant scornfully said, "Verily, we disbelieve in what you believe
7|77|Then they did hamstring the she-camel, and rebelled against the commandment of their Lord and said, "O Salih! Bring upon us what you did threaten us with, if you are of those who are sent
7|78|Then the earthquake seized them, and in the morning they lay prone in their dwellings
7|79|And Salih turned away from them and said, "O my people! I did deliver unto you the message of my Lord, and I gave you good advice; but you love not sincere advisers
7|80|And (remember) Lot, when he said to his people, "Do you approach an abomination which no creature ever did before you
7|81|Verily, you approach men with lust instead of women. Nay, you are a people who far exceed the bounds
7|82|But his people´s answer was only to say, "Turn them out of your communities. Verily, they are a people who strive to purity
7|83|But We saved him and his people, except his wife, who was of those who lagged behind
7|84|And We rained down upon them a shower (of brimstone); - see then the nature of the consequences for sinners
7|85|And unto Median did We send their brother Shu´eyb (Jethro?), who said, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God save Him. There has come to you a manifest Sign from your Lord. So give good weight and full measure, and be not niggardly of your
7|86|And lurk not in every path, threatening (and corrupting) and hindering from the path of Allah those who believe in Him, craving to make it crooked. Remember when you were few (small or weak) and He multiplied (increased, strengthened) you; and see w
7|87|And if there be a party of you who believe in what I am sent with, and a party who believe not, then wait patiently until Allah judges between us, for He is the best of Judges
7|88|The chieftains of his people, inflated with arrogance said, "We will of a surety turn you out, O Shu´heyb, and those who believe with you, from our communities, unless you return unto our faith." Said he, "What! Even if we be averse t
7|89|We shall have devised a lie against Allah if we return unto your faith, after Allah has saved us from it; and what should ail us that we should return thereto, unless that Allah our Lord should please? Our Lord is All-comprehending in His knowledge
7|90|But the chiefs of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, "If you follow Shu´eyb, verily, you shall be the losers
7|91|So the earthquake seized them, and in the morning they lay prone in their dwellings
7|92|Those who denied Shu´eyb, became as though they had not dwelt there! - Those who had denied Shu´eyb, they were the losers
7|93|And he turned away from them and said, "O my people! I delivered unto you the messages of my Lord, and I gave you good advice; how should I be vexed for a people who disbelieve
7|94|We have not sent unto a community any prophet but We inflicted the people thereof with tribulation (suffering, distress) and adversity, that per chance (or possibly) they might humble themselves
7|95|And then did We exchanged good for evil (suffering for prosperity), until they grew (in strength and prosperity) and said, "Our fathers, too, were touched by both suffering and joy." Then We overtook them suddenly ere they realized their peril
7|96|Had the people of the town but believed and feared, We would have opened up for them blessings from the heavens and from the earth; but they said it was a lie, so We overcame them for that which they had earned
7|97|Were, then, the people of these cities secure that Our Wrath would not come on them by night, while they slept
7|98|Were the people of these cities secure that Our Wrath would not come on them in the morning whilst they played carefree
7|99|Were they secure from the Plan of Allah? None deems himself secure from the Plan of Allah except a people that are doomed to perish
7|100|Is it not a guidance (lesson) shown to those who inherit the earth after its (former) people, that, did We please, We would smite them in their sins, and would set a stamp upon their heart that they should not hear
7|101|Such were these cities. We do relate to you their stories. There came to them Our Messengers with manifest Signs; but they would not believe because of what they had rejected before. Thus does Allah seal up their heart of those who disbelieve
7|102|Nor did We find most of them true to their covenant; but We did find most of them workers of abomination
7|103|Then We raised up after them Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs; but they dealt unjustly with them. So see what was the consequence for these evildoers (corrupters, mischief-makers)
7|104|Moses said, "O Pharaoh! Verily, I am a messenger from the Lord of the Worlds
7|105|One, for whom it is not right to speak against Allah aught but the truth. I have come to you with a manifest sign from my Lord. Send, then, the children of Israel with me
7|106|Said he (Pharaoh), "If you have come with a Sign, then bring it, if you are truthful
7|107|Then he (Moses) threw his rod down, and lo! It was a manifest serpent
7|108|And he drew out his hand, and lo! It was white to the beholders
7|109|Said the chiefs of Pharaoh´s people, "Verily, this is surely a knowing (expert) magician
7|110|He desires to turn you out of your land. What is it, then, your advise
7|111|They said, "Delay him and his brother, and send summoners into the cities
7|112|To bring unto you every knowing (expert) magician
7|113|And the magician came to Pharaoh and said, "Is there, indeed, a reward for us if we are victors
7|114|He answered, "Yea! And you shall be of those who are brought nigh unto me (given high posts, ranks or honour)
7|115|They said, "O Moses! Will you cast down (your rod) or shall we be (first) to throw
7|116|Said he, "Throw first". And when they threw down their rods, they bewitched (hypnotized) the people´s eyes, and struck terror into them, for they did a mighty magic
7|117|But We inspired Moses (saying), "Throw down your rod." and it swallowed up their lying show
7|118|And the truth stood fast, and vain was that which they had done
7|119|Thus were they vanquished there, and turned back humiliated
7|120|And the magicians threw themselves down in prostration
7|121|Said they, "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds
7|122|The Lord of Moses and Aaron
7|123|Said Pharaoh, "Do you believe in him ere I give you permission? This is a plot which you have devised in the land, to drive its people hence. But soon shall you know (the consequences)
7|124|I will cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides, then I will crucify you every one
7|125|They said, "Verily, we return unto our Lord
7|126|Do you take vengeance on us because we believe in the signs of our Lord, when they come to us. Our Lord! Pour out upon us patience and constancy, and take us to Thyself as men who have surrendered (become Muslims)
7|127|And the chiefs of Pharaoh´s people said, "(O King) Will you leave Moses and his people to do mischief in the land, and to flout you and your gods?" Said he, "We will have their sons slain and their women we will spare, for, verily, we
7|128|Moses said unto his people, "Seek help from Allah and have endurance. Verily, the earth is Allah´s! He gives it for an inheritance to whom He pleases of His servants, and the future is for those who fear (keep their duty and are righteous).&quo
7|129|They said, "We suffered before you did come to us, and also since you have come to us." Said he, "It may be that your Lord will destroy your foe, and will make you vicegerents (inheritors, successors) in the earth, that He may see how you b
7|130|We punished Pharaoh´s people with the years (of drought) and scarcity of fruit or crops), that per chance (or possibly) they might remember
7|131|But whenever good (times) came to them they said, "This is due to our effort." And if evil befell them, they ascribed it to the evil influences of Moses and those with him. Surely, the evil influence is only in the hands of Allah. But most of th
7|132|And they said, "Whatever Sign you bring to enchant us, we will not put faith in you
7|133|So We sent upon them the flood and the locusts and the vermin and the frogs and the blood, - a succession of clear Signs. But they were inflated with arrogance, a guilty people
7|134|And when there fell upon them the plague, they said, "O Moses! Call upon your Lord for us, as He has covenanted with you. Verily, if you do remove the plague from us, we will put our trust in you; and we will assuredly let the children of Israel go w
7|135|But when We removed the penalty from them, according to an appointed term which they had to fulfil, lo! then they broke their promise
7|136|But We took retribution from them, and We drowned them in the sea because they rejected Our Signs, and were careless thereof
7|137|And We gave unto a people, despised and weak, an inheritance, lands in both east and west, lands which We had blessed. And the good promise of your Lord was fulfiled on the children of Israel, because they were patient and constant. And We utterly destroy
7|138|And We passed the children of Israel safely across the sea. They came upon a people devoted to their idols, and said, "O Moses! Make for us a god as the gods they have." Said he, "Verily, you are ignorant people
7|139|Verily, these people- destroyed shall be their way, and vain is that which they are doing
7|140|He said, "Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah, when He has preferred you above all creatures
7|141|And (remember) when We saved you from Pharaoh´s people who wrought you evil woe, slaying your sons, and sparing your women. In that was a mighty trial from your Lord
7|142|And We appointed for Moses thirty nights (of solitude), and added ten (more), and he completed the time appointed by his Lord for forty nights. And Moses said unto his brother Aaron, "Act for me amongst my people, and do what is right, and follow not
7|143|And when Moses came to Our appointment, and his Lord spoke unto him, he said, "O my Lord! Show me Thyself, that I may look on Thee!" Allah said, "Thou canst not see Me; but look upon the mountain. If it remains steady in its place, you have
7|144|He said, "O Moses! Verily, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My words. Take then what I have brought you, and be of the thankful
7|145|And We wrote for him upon Tablets, admonitions, commanding and explaining everything, and said, "Hold fast to them, and bid your people take the best course, made clear therein. I will show you the abode of those who work abominations
7|146|I will turn from My revelations those who wrongfully magnify themselves with pride in the earth; and though they see every Sign, they shall not believe therein, and if they see the path of rectitude they shall not take it for their path; but if they see t
7|147|But those who deny Our revelations (or Signs) and the meeting of the Hereafter, in vain are their works. Shall they be rewarded save for that which they have done
7|148|And the people of Moses, after he had left them, chose (for worship) an image of a lowing calf (or one that seemed to low) made out of their ornaments. Did they not see that it could not speak to them or guide them in the path? They chose it and became wr
7|149|But when they bit their hands (in realization and fear) and saw that they had gone astray, they said, "Verily, if our Lord have not compassion on us and forgive us we shall surely be of those who are lost
7|150|And when Moses returned unto his people angry and grieved, he said, "Evil is it that which you have done after I had gone! Would you hasten on the judgment of your Lord?". And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the (hair on his)
7|151|Moses prayed, "O Lord! Forgive my brother and me and let us enter into Thy mercy; for Thou art the most merciful of the merciful
7|152|Verily, those who have taken to themselves a calf, there shall reach them wrath from their Lord, and abasement in the life of this world; for thus do we reward those who forge a lie
7|153|But those who have done bad works, and then turn again after them and believe - verily, your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful
7|154|And when Moses´ wrath calmed down he took up the Tables, in the inscription of which was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord
7|155|And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointment; and when the earthquake took them he prayed, "O my Lord! Had you willed, you could have destroyed both them and me before this. Will Thou destroy us for what the fools amongst us have d
7|156|And ordain for us good in this world, and in the Hereafter too; verily, we are guided unto Thee." He said, "With My punishment, I fall on whom I will; but My mercy embraces everything; and I will ordain it for those who do right, and practice ch

7|159|Amongst the people of Moses is a section who guide with truth, and thereby act justly
7|160|And We divided them into twelve tribes, nation; and We inspired Moses, when his people asked him for water, saying, "Strike the rock with your staff!" and there gushed forth from it twelve springs, so that each tribe knew their drinking place. A
7|161|And when it was said unto them, "Dwell in this city and eat there from (enjoy its facilities) as you will, and say "Repentance" and enter the gate prostrate (in humility); so will We forgive you your sins; We will increase (the portion or r)
7|162|But those amongst them who did wrong changed the words given them for another saying; and We sent upon them a wrath from heaven for that they were unjust (or transgressed)
7|163|Ask them, too, about the city which stood by the sea, how they broke the Sabbath; how on the Sabbath day the fish came straight up to them; but on the days when they kept not the Sabbath, they came not to them. Thus did We try them for the evil that they
7|164|And when a community from amongst them said, "Why do you warn a people whom Allah would destroy, or punish with severe torment?" they said, "In order to do our duty to our Lord, that per chance (or possibly) they may fear (evil)
7|165|But when they forgot what they had been reminded of, We saved those who forbade evil, and We overtook those who did wrong with grievous punishment because they transgressed
7|166|But when they rebelled against what they were forbidden, We said to them, "Become you as apes, despised and spurned
7|167|And (remember) when your Lord proclaimed that He would surely raise against them till the Day of Resurrection, those who would lay on them grievous torment. Verily, your Lord is quick in retribution, but verily, He is also Forgiving, Merciful
7|168|We broke them up into sections in the earth. Among them are some who are righteous, and among them are those who are the opposite. We have tried them with good things and with bad things, that per chance (or possibly) they may return (to Us)
7|169|But after them a generation succeeded them who inherited the Book (Scriptures)! They chose the vanities of this lower world, saying, "Everything will be forgiven us." But if similar vanities came to them again they would seize them too! Was ther
7|170|But those who hold fast by the Book and are steadfast in prayer - verily, We will not waste the wages of those who do right
7|171|And when We shook the mountain over them, as though it were a covering, and they thought it would fall upon them, We said, "Take you what We have given you with firmness, and remember what is therein; per chance (or possibly) you may fear Allah
7|172|And when your Lord drew forth from the children of Adam, out of their loins, their seed (or descendants), and made them testify about themselves, "Am I not your Lord?" They said, "Yea! We do bear witness" - lest you should say on the D
7|173|Or say, "Verily, our fathers associated others with Allah before us, and we were but their seed after them. Will you then destroy us for the futile deeds of the doers of futility (or vanities)
7|174|Thus do We explain the Signs that per chance (or possibly) they may return (or turn to Us)
7|175|Read to them the declaration of him to whom We brought our Signs, and who stepped away there from, and Satan followed him, and he became one of those who lead (tempt or are tempted to go) astray
7|176|Had We pleased We would have exalted him thereby (with Our Signs), but he clung to the earth and followed his own lust, and his likeness was as the likeness of a dog, whom if you should attack he hangs out his tongue, or if you should leave him, hangs out
7|177|Evil is the likeness of a people who deny Our revelations (or Signs) and wrong their own souls
7|178|He whom Allah leads, he indeed is led aright, while he whom Allah sends astray, they are indeed losers
7|179|We have created for hell many of the Jinn and of Mankind; they have heart and they discern not therewith; they have eyes and they see not therewith; they have ears and they hear not therewith; they are like cattle, nay, more misguided, for they are heedle
7|180|But Allah belong the most beautiful names; call on Him then thereby, and leave those who pervert (profane or blaspheme against) His names. They shall be rewarded for that which they have done
7|181|And of those whom We have created is a people who are guided with the truth and establish justice therewith
7|182|But they who deny Our revelations We will bring them down by degrees from whence they know not
7|183|I give them rein, for verily, my scheme is effective
7|184|Do they not then reflect that their companion is not possessed? He is but a perspicuous Warner
7|185|Do they not behold the kingdoms of the heavens and of the earth, and what things Allah has created, and (see that), it may well be that their term is already drawing to its end? In what after this then will they believe
7|186|He whom Allah leads astray there is no guide for him! He leaves them blindly wandering in their rebellion
7|187|They will ask you about the (final) Hour, for what time it is fixed? - Say, "The knowledge thereof is only with my Lord; none shall manifest it at its time but He. Heavy is its burden in the heavens and the earth. It will come to you suddenly and una
7|188|Say, "For myself I have no power to benefit, nor power to harm, save what Allah will. Had I knowledge of the Unseen I should surely have multiplied all that is good, and no adversity would touch me; I am but a Warner and a herald of good tidings unto
7|189|He it is who created you from a single soul, and made there from its mate to dwell with her (in comfort and love); and when he covered her she bore a light burden, and went about therewith (unnoticed); but when it grew heavy they cried unto Allah, their L
7|190|But when He gave them both a well-formed child, they joined partners with Him with respect to that which He had given them. But Allah is exalted above that which they associate with Him
7|191|Will they associate with Him those who cannot create aught, but are themselves created
7|192|And have no power to help them, nor can even help themselves
7|193|But if you call them unto guidance they follow you not. It is all the same to them if you call them or if you hold your tongue
7|194|Those whom you call on other than Allah are servants like yourselves. Call on them then, and let them answer you, if you are truthful
7|195|Have they feet to walk with? Or have they hands to hold with? Or have they eyes to see with? Or have they ears to hear with? Say, Call upon your (supposed) partners (of Allah); then plot against me, and spare me not
7|196|Verily, my patron (or protecting friend) is Allah, who reveals the Book, and He is the Friend of the righteous
7|197|But those whom you call on beside Him have no power to help you, nor can they help themselves
7|198|But if you call them unto the guidance, they hear not. You will see them looking at you, yet they see not
7|199|Hold to forgiveness, and command what is kind, and shun the ignorant
7|200|And if an incitement from the devil wound you, then seek refuge in Allah: verily, He is Hearer and Knower
7|201|Verily, those who fear Allah, if a temptation (suggestion, whisper) from the devil touches (assaults, troubles) them, they do but remember (or mention) Him, and lo! They see (realise)
7|202|And their brethren he shall increase in error, then they shall not desist
7|203|If you bring them not a verse (of revelation) they say, "Have you not yet made choice of one? Say, "I only follow what is inspired in me by my Lord. These are lights (perceptions, insights) from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy to a people
7|204|And when the Quran is read, then listen thereto with attention, and keep silence, that per chance (or possibly) you may obtain mercy
7|205|And remember your Lord within yourself humbly and with awe, below your breath, in the morning and in the evening; and be not of those who are neglectful (or unheedful)
7|206|Verily, they who are with your Lord are not too big with pride (arrogant) for His service, but they praise and bow before Him in adoration
8|1|They will ask you about the spoils of war. Say, "The spoils belong to Allah and the Messenger, so fear (keep your duty to) Allah and keep straight the relationship amongst yourselves; obey Allah and the Messenger if you do believe
8|2|Verily, the believers are those who, when Allah´s name is mentioned, their heart sinks with awe; and when His Signs (revelations) are recited to them they increase them in faith; and in their Lord do they trust
8|3|Who are steadfast in worship, and spend of what We have bestowed upon them
8|4|These are in truth believers. For them are degrees of honour with their Lord, and forgiveness, and a generous provision
8|5|Even as your Lord caused you to go forth from your house with the Truth, a sect of the believers were averse to it
8|6|They disputed with you about the Truth after it was made plain, as though they were being driven on to visible death
8|7|And when Allah promised you that one of the two troops (the army or the caravan) should be your s, and you yearned to have the unarmed one (the caravan). Allah wished to justify Truth by His words, and to cut off the root of the unbelievers
8|8|That He might cause Truth to triumph and make Falsehood vain, despite the aversion of the guilty
8|9|Remember when you asked for succour from your Lord, and He answered you, "I will assist you with a thousand angels, in many ranks
8|10|Allah made it glad tidings only to reassure your heart therewith, for victory comes only from Allah! Verily, Allah is Mighty and Wise
8|11|Remember when drowsiness covered you as a reassurance from Him, and He sent down upon you rain from heaven to purify you, to remove from you the plague of Satan, and to make strong your heart and firm your footsteps
8|12|Remember when your Lord inspired the angels, saying, "Verily, I am with you; make you firm, then, those who believe; I will cast dread into the heart of the unbelievers; strike off their necks, and strike off their finger tip
8|13|This is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger; for he who goes into opposition against Allah and His Messenger, verily, Allah is strict in punishment
8|14|Thus (it will be said) "There, taste the punishment, for disbelievers is the torment of the Fire
8|15|O you who believe! When you meet the disbelievers in hostile swarms, turn not to them your backs
8|16|For he who turns his back that day, save as a stratagem of war, or to retreat to his own troop, brings down upon himself the wrath of Allah, and his resort is Hell, an evil refuge
8|17|It is not you who slew them, but it was Allah who slew them; nor was it you who threw (the dust to blind the enemy), but Allah who threw it to test the believers by goodly test from Himself; verily, Allah is Hearer, Knower
8|18|That and also because Allah weakens the stratagem of the disbelievers
8|19|(O unbelievers!) If you sought a judgment, a decision has now come to you. But if you desist, it will be better for you; but if you return to the attack, We, too will return. And your troop shall avail you nothing, however great in number it be, since All

8|21|Be not like those who say, "We hear," and yet they hear not
8|22|Verily, the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are the deaf, the dumb who understand not
8|23|Had Allah known any good in them, He would have made them hear; but had He made them hear, they would have turned away, averse
8|24|O you who believe! Respond unto Allah and His Messenger when He calls you to that which quickens you; and know that Allah comes in between a man and his own heart; and that He it is unto Whom you shall be gathered
8|25|And fear temptation (or trial, chastisement, oppression, discord, chaos) which falls not exclusively on those of you who have done wrong; but know that Allah is severe in punishment
8|26|Remember when you were few in number and weak in the land, fearing lest people should despoil and snatch you away; then He sheltered you and strengthened you with His aid, and provided you with good things, that per chance (or possibly) you may give thank
8|27|O you who believe! Be not treacherous to Allah and His Messenger; nor knowingly betray your trusts (obligations, duties, responsibilities in respect of wealth, property, confidences, knowledge, talents, time, opportunities, circumstances, power, social po)
8|28|Know that your wealth and your children are but a test, and that with Allah is the highest wage
8|29|O you who believe! If you fear (does your duty to) Allah He will give you discrimination (or a Criterion) and will rid you of your evil thoughts and deeds, and will forgive you; for Allah is Lord of Infinite Bounty
8|30|And when those who disbelieved plotted against you to detain you in bonds, or slay you, or drive you forth - they plotted, but Allah also plotted, for Allah is best of Plotters
8|31|But when Our verses were recited to them they said, "We have already heard. If We pleased We could speak like this; verily, this is nothing but tales of ancient folk
8|32|When they said, "O Allah! If this be indeed truth from Thee, then rain down upon us stones from heaven or bring us grievous doom
8|33|But Allah would not torment them while you were amongst them; nor will He punish them while they seek forgiveness
8|34|But what plea have they that Allah should not punish them when they turn folk away from the Sacred Mosque (The Kaaba), though they are not its fitting guardians? Its fitting guardians are only the righteous (those who keep their duty to Allah), but most o
8|35|Their prayer at the House was naught but whistling and hand clapping! Therefore, (it is said to them) Taste of the doom because you disbelieved
8|36|Verily, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to turn folk away from the path of Allah; but they shall spend it, and then it shall become sighing (regret) for them, and then they shall be overcome. Those who disbelieve shall be gathered into hell
8|37|That Allah may separate the vile from the good, and may stack the vile on top of each others, and heap them together in hell! Such are the losers
8|38|Tell those who disbelieve, that if they desist they will be forgiven what is past; but if they return (to evil ways) then the example of men of former days has already gone before them
8|39|Fight them then until there be no more oppression, and that religion may be wholly Allah´s. But if they desist, then Allah is Seer of what they do
8|40|But if they turn their backs, then know that Allah is your patron, the Supreme Patron, the Supreme Helper
8|41|And know that whenever you seize anything as a spoil of war, to Allah belongs a fifth thereof, and to His Apostle, and to kindred and orphans, and the needy and the wayfarer; if you believe in Allah and what We have revealed unto Our servants on the Day o

8|43|Allah showed them unto you (Muhammad) in your dream as few in number. But had He shown them to you as many, you (Muslims) would have been timid (afraid), and you would have quarrelled about the matter. But Allah saved you from this. Verily, He knows well
8|44|And when He showed them to you (Muslims), when you encountered them, as few in your eyes; and made you seem weak (or contemptible) in their eyes, it was that Allah might accomplish a thing that must be done (or was fore-ordained); for unto Allah do all th

8|46|And obey Allah and His Messenger, and dispute not with one another, lest you falter (or lose heart) and your strength (or powers or luck) depart, but be steadfast (patient and persevering), for verily, Allah is with the steadfast
8|47|And be not like those who went forth from their homes with insolence, and for appearance sake before men, and to turn away people from the way of Allah, for Allah surrounds all things
8|48|And when Satan made their works appear seemly to them, and said, "There is none amongst mankind to conquer you to-day, for, verily, I am near you." But when the two armies came in sight of each other, he turned upon his heels (took flight) and s

8|51|This is for what your hands have sent on before you; and know that Allah is no tyrant to his servants
8|52|Their deeds are like those of Pharaoh´s people and those before them! They rejected the Signs (revelations) of Allah, and Allah overtook them in their sins. Verily, Allah is strong and severe in punishment
8|53|That is because Allah is not one to change the favour He has bestowed on a people, until they first change what they have in themselves (in their own souls), and because Allah is Hearer and Knower
8|54|Their way is like those of Pharaoh´s people and those before them! They denied Our Signs (or revelations), and We destroyed them in their sins, and drowned Pharaoh´s people. All were evildoers
8|55|Verily, the worst of beasts in Allah´s eyes are those who are ungrateful and will not believe
8|56|Those with whom if you make a treaty, they break their treaty at each opportunity, for they fear not (or keep not their duty to) Allah
8|57|Should you come to war with them, then deal with them so as to strike fear into those who come after them (as an example), that per chance (or possibly) they may remember
8|58|And should you ever fear treachery from any people, then throw back to them their treaty in like manner (or in fairness); verily, Allah loves not the treacherous
8|59|Let not those who disbelieve deem that they can outstrip (believers or Allah´s purpose); verily, they cannot frustrate them (or escape)
8|60|Prepare you against them what strength of forces and horses you have to the utmost of your power, that thereby you may dismay the enemies of Allah, and your enemies, and others beside them whom you know not. You do not know them, but Allah knows them! Wha
8|61|But if they incline to peace, incline you to it also, and trust in Allah; verily, He is Hearer and Knower
8|62|But if they wish to betray (or deceive) you, then, verily, Allah is sufficient for you! He it is who supports you with His help and with the believers
8|63|And attunes (or reconciles) their heart! If you had spent all that is in the earth you could not have attuned their heart, but Allah reconciled them, verily, He is Mighty and Wise
8|64|O you Prophet! Sufficient unto you is Allah, and unto those of the believers who follow you
8|65|O you Prophet! Urge on the believers to fight. If there be of you twenty steadfast men, they shall overcome two hundred; if there be of you a hundred, they shall overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve, because they are a people without understanding
8|66|Now has Allah made light your burden, for He knows that there is a weakness in you: but if there be amongst you but a steadfast hundred, they will vanquish two hundred; and if there be of you a thousand, they will vanquish two thousand, by the permission
8|67|It has not been for any Prophet to take captives until he hath subdued the land! You desire the lure of this world, but Allah desires the Hereafter, for Allah is Mighty, Wise
8|68|Were it not for an ordinance from Allah that had gone before, there would have touched you a mighty punishment for that which you took (prisoners for ransom)
8|69|Eat (enjoy, utilize) of what spoils you have taken, what is lawful and good; and fear Allah, verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
8|70|O you Prophet! Say to such of the captives as are in your hands, "If Allah knows of any good in your heart, He will give you better than that which is taken from you, and will forgive you; for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
8|71|But if they desire to betray you - they have betrayed Allah before! - but He hath given you power over them; for Allah is Knower, Wise
8|72|Verily, those who believe and have fled into exile (left their homes), and fought strenuously with their wealth and lives in the cause of Allah, and those who have given them refuge and help, these shall be kin (or friends and protectors) to each other. B
8|73|And those who disbelieve, some of them are kin (or protectors) of one another - unless you act the same there will be confusion (or oppression) in the land, and great corruption (or mischief)
8|74|Those who believe and have left their homes and striven strenuously in the cause of Allah, and those who have given them a refuge and a help, these are the believers. For them is forgiveness and generous provision
8|75|Those who accept faith later and leave their homes and strive strenuously with you, these are of you. But blood relations are nearer to one another in the Book of Allah (also called the Eternal Decree, the Preserved Tablet or it can be called the Universa)
9|1|An immunity from Allah and His Messenger to those idolaters with whom you have made a treaty (or alliance)

9|7|How can there be for the idolaters a treaty with Allah and with His Messenger, save those with whom you have made a treaty at the Sacred Mosque! Then while they stand by you, stand you by them; verily, Allah loves the righteous (those who fear evil)
9|8|How (can there be any treaty)! - for if they prevail against you, they respect neither ties of blood nor of agreements. They please you with their mouths while their heart refuse; and most of them work abomination (or are wicked and rebellious)
9|9|They barter Allah´s signs (or revelations) for a little price and they turn folk away from His way; verily, evil is that which they are wont to do
9|10|They will not observe towards a believer ties of kindred nor ties of honour (or covenants); these are the transgressors
9|11|But if they repent and establish regular prayer and practice regular charity, then they are your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations unto a people that have knowledge
9|12|But if they break faith with you after their treaty, and assail (taunt or attack) your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief - verily, they have no faith - in order that they may desist
9|13|Will you not fight a people who broke their solemn pledges, and intended to expel the Messenger and attacked you first? What! Fear you them? Allah is more deserving that you should fear Him if you be believers
9|14|Fight them! Allah will chastise them by your hands, and disgrace them, and give you victory against them, and He will heal the breasts of a people who believe
9|15|And He will remove rage from their heart; for Allah relents unto whomsoever He will. Allah is Knower, Wise
9|16|Did you suppose that you would be left in peace, when Allah has not yet determined (tested) those of you who will strive, and who take none other than Allah and His Messenger, and the believers for protectors and friends? But Allah is well aware of what y
9|17|It is not for idolaters to tend the mosques of Allah, while bearing witness against the infidelity of their own souls; for such their works are vain, and in the Fire shall they dwell
9|18|Only he shall tend the mosques of Allah who believes in Allah and the Last Day, and is steadfast in prayer, and practices regular charity, and fears none but Allah. Only these can be expected to be among those who are rightly guided
9|19|Have you supposed that giving drink to the pilgrims and tending the Sacred Mosque are equal to believing in Allah and in the Last Day, and striving in the way of Allah? They are not equal in the sight of Allah, and Allah guides not a wrongdoing people
9|20|Those who believe and who have left their homes (migrated) and striven with their wealth and with their lives in the way of Allah, are highest in rank in the sight of Allah. These are the triumphant

9|22|There they shall abide forever. Verily, Allah, with Him is mighty reward

9|37|Verily, postponement (of the sacred months) is but an addition of disbelief to lead astray therewith those who disbelieve. They make it lawful one year, but they make it unlawful in another, that they may make up the number of months which Allah has made

9|46|Had they wished to go forth, they would certainly have prepared some equipment; but Allah was averse from their being sent forth, and held them back, and they were told "Sit you with the inactive (sedentary or passive)

11|32|They said, "O Noah! You have wrangled with us, and have multiplied disputation among us. Now bring upon us what you have threatened us with, if you are of the truthful
11|33|Said he, "Allah will only bring it on you when He pleases, nor can you make Him helpless (frustrate Him)
11|34|Nor will my advice profit you were I minded to advise you, if Allah wills to keep you astray. He is your Lord, and unto Him shall you return
11|35|Do they say, "He has invented it?" Say, "If I have devised it, then on me be my crime, but I am clear (innocent) of all that you commit
11|36|And Noah was inspired (in these words), "None shall surely believe amongst your people but those who have believed already; take it not then ill that which they do
11|37|And make the Ark under Our eyes (supervision, purposes), and at Our inspiration (instructions); and plead not with Me for those who have done wrong. Verily, they shall be drowned
11|38|So he made the Ark; and every time the chiefs of his people passed by him they mocked at him. Said he, "If you mock at us, verily, we shall mock at you even as you are mocking
11|39|And you shall surely soon know who it is to whom the punishment that confounds and shames shall come, and upon whom shall fall the lasting doom
11|40|Then when Our commandment came to pass, and the geysers gushed forth water, We said, "Load therein two of every kind, a pair (male and female), and your family, save him on whom the sentence has already been passed, and those who believe." But t
11|41|And he said, "Ride you therein. In the name of Allah is its course, and its mooring. Verily, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful
11|42|And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains; and Noah cried to his son who had gone aside (stood aloof or separated himself), "O my boy! Ride with us and be not with the disbelievers
11|43|The son replied, "I will betake me to some mountain that shall save me from the water (I will find another solution)." Said Noah, "There is none this day that can save from the command of Allah, except for him on whom He may have mercy.&quo
11|44|And it was said, "O earth! Swallow down your water! And, O heaven! Withhold you rain!" And the water abated; and the matter was decided, and the Ark settled on Mount Judi, and the word went forth, "Removed are the evildoing people
11|45|And Noah called unto his Lord saying, "My Lord, verily, my son is of my family (people), and, surely Thy promise is true, and Thou art the most just of judges
11|46|He said, "O Noah! He is not of your family (people); verily, because his conduct is unrighteous. Therefore ask Me not for that of which you have no knowledge. Verily, I give you counsel lest you should be among the ignorant
11|47|He said, "My Lord, verily, I seek refuge in Thee (from wrong) lest I ask Thee that whereof I have no knowledge. Unless Thou dost forgive me and have mercy on me, I shall be of those who are lost
11|48|The word came, "O Noah! Descend (from the Ark) in peace from Us, and blessings upon you and upon some of the communities who will descend from you; but other communities We shall grant enjoyment for a time and then there shall touch, them, from Us gr
11|49|These are some of the stories of the Unseen that We reveal unto you. You did not know them before this, you and your people. So persevere patiently; verily, the sequel is for those who fear (are righteous)
11|50|And unto the tribe of A´ad (We sent) their brother Hud. He said, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God but Him. You do but invent lies (superstitions, fantasies, self-deception)
11|51|O my people! I do not ask you for hire (wages, rewards) in return (for the message); Lo, my hire is only from Him who created me: have you then no sense (or understanding)
11|52|O my people! Ask pardon of your Lord; then turn to Him in repentance; He will send the skies (rain, spiritual, social and material bounties) down on you in torrents; and He will add strength to your strength: turn not away, guilty
11|53|They said, "O Hud! You have not come to us with a manifest sign (or clear proof); nor will we leave our gods at your word; nor will we believe in you
11|54|We say nothing but that, perhaps, some of our gods have possessed you with madness." Said he, "Verily, I call Allah to witness, and do you bear witness too, that I am free from ascribing to (or associating with) Him
11|55|Other gods as partners. Plot then against me together (as much as you like), and give me no respite
11|56|Verily, I trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no beast that walks but He grasps it by its forelock (has complete power over it). Verily, my Lord is on the Straight Way
11|57|But if you turn your backs, then I have conveyed to you that wherewith I was sent to you; and my Lord will replace you with another people. You cannot harm (frustrate) Him at all; verily, my Lord is Guardian over all things
11|58|And when Our commandment came We saved Hud, and those who believed with him, by mercy from Us; We saved them from a harsh torment
11|59|Such were (the tribe of) A´ad. They denied the signs of their Lord, and rebelled against His Messengers, and followed the bidding of every headstrong tyrant
11|60|They were followed in this world by a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection. Behold! A´ad disbelieved in their Lord! Aye! Removed were A´ad the people of Hud
11|61|And unto Thamud (We sent) their brother Salih. Said he, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God but Him. He it is that produced you from the earth, and made you live therein! So ask pardon of Him; then turn to Him in repentance. Verily, my Lord is
11|62|They said, "O Salih! You were, before this, amongst us one we hoped in. Do you forbid us to worship what our fathers worshipped? Verily, we are in grave doubt as to that to which you call us
11|63|He said, "O my people! Bethink you, if I stand upon a manifest sign (clear proof) from my Lord, and there come from Him mercy, who will help me against Allah if I rebel against Him? You will add to me naught but perdition
11|64|O my people! This she-camel of Allah is a test (symbol, token) for you; leave her, then, to feed in Allah´s earth, and touch her not with harm, lest a near torment seize you
11|65|But they did hamstring her, and he said, "Enjoy yourselves in your houses for three days; this is the promise that shall not be belied
11|66|And when Our commandment came to pass, We saved Salih, and those who believed with him, by Our mercy, from the ignominy of that day. Verily, your Lord He is Powerful and Mighty
11|67|And a mighty noise caught those who had done wrong; and on the morrow they were lying corpses in their houses
11|68|As though they had never dwelt therein. Behold, Thamud indeed disbelieved in their Lord. Aye! Removed were the Thamud
11|69|Our messengers came unto Abraham with Glad Tidings. They said, "Peace!" He answered, "Peace be it!" and did not delay to bring the roasted calf
11|70|But when he saw that their hands reached not to it, he felt mistrust, and conceived a fear of them. They said, "Fear not. Verily, we are sent unto the people of Lot
11|71|And his wife was standing by, laughing; and We gave her the glad tidings of Isaac, and of Jacob after Isaac
11|72|Said she, "Alas for me! Shall I bear a son when I am an old woman, and this husband of mine an old man? Verily, this is a strange thing
11|73|They said, "Do you wonder at the commandment of Allah? The Mercy of Allah and His blessings upon you, O you people of the house! Verily, He is worthy of all Praise, worthy of all Glory
11|74|And when his terror left Abraham, and the glad tidings reached him, he pleaded with Us on behalf of the people of Lot
11|75|Verily, Abraham was relenting (tolerant), compassionate, and Allah-relying
11|76|(It was said,) "O Abraham! Forsake this (pleading). Verily, the commandment of your Lord has gone forth, and verily, there comes to them a torment that cannot be repelled
11|77|And when Our messengers (angels) came to Lot, he was grieved for them (the people), and his arm was powerless to aid them. He said, "This is a distressful day
11|78|And his people came unto him, rushing, for they were long used to committing abomination (homosexuality). He said, "O my people! Here are my daughters (or young women), they are purer for you. Fear Allah, and do not disgrace me through my guests. Is
11|79|They said, "You know that we have no need of your daughters; verily, you well know what we want
11|80|He said, "Would that I had strength to resist you or could betake myself of some powerful support
11|81|(The messengers) said, "O Lot! Verily, we are the messengers of your Lord. They shall certainly not reach you; now travel with your people in the darkness of the night, and let none of you look round. But your wife (will do so), and there shall befal
11|82|And when Our commandment came, We overthrew (their town), making their high parts into low parts (turned them upside down). And We rained down upon them stones and baked clay one after another
11|83|Marked with fire from your Lord, and these are never far from the wrongdoers
11|84|And unto Midian (we sent) their brother Shu´eyb. He said, "O my people! Serve Allah; you have no God but Him, and give not short measure and weight. Verily, I see you well off; but, verily, I fear for you the torments of an encompassing Day
11|85|O my people! Give measure and weight fairly, and defraud not men of their due; and wreak not wrong in the earth, corrupting it
11|86|That which Allah leaves for you is better for you if you be believers. But I am not a guardian (or keeper) over you
11|87|They said, "O Shu´eyb! Do your prayers bid you that we should forsake what our fathers served, or that we should not do as we please with our own property? You are, forsooth, the clement and straight-forward one (or simpleton)
11|88|He said, "O my people! Bethink you, if I stand upon a manifest sign (clear proof) from my Lord, and He provides me from Himself with a goodly provision, how can I concede aught to you. I desire not to do behind your backs that which I forbid you. I d
11|89|O my people! Let not a breach with me cause you to so sin that there befall you the like of that which befell the people of Noah, or the people of Hud, or the people of Salih, nor are the people of Lot far off from you
11|90|So ask pardon from your Lord, then turn to Him repentant; verily, my Lord is Merciful, Loving
11|91|They said, "O Shu´eyb! We do not understand much of what you say, and we see that you are weak (powerless) amongst us; and were it not for your family we would stone you, nor could you have power over us
11|92|He said, "O my people! Are my family more esteemed by you than Allah? Or have you taken Him as something to cast behind your backs? Verily, my Lord, surrounds all you do
11|93|O my people! Act according to your power; verily, I too will act, and you soon will know on whom comes a doom that will abase them, and him who is a liar. Watch then; verily, I am watching with you
11|94|And when Our commandment came, We saved Shu´eyb, and those who believed with him, by Our Mercy; and the great noise seized those who had done wrong, and on the morrow they were found prostrate in their houses
11|95|As though they had not dwelt therein. Behold! Removed was Midian! As was removed Thamud
11|96|And We sent Moses with our signs (revelations) and with obvious (clear) power
11|97|Unto Pharaoh and his chiefs; but they followed the command of Pharaoh, and the command of Pharaoh was no right (or true, straight) guidance
11|98|He shall approach his people on the Day of Resurrection, and take them to the Fire (as cattle are led to the watering-place) - ah, a woeful watering-place is that wither they are led
11|99|A curse follows them in this world and on the Day of Resurrection - ah, woeful is the gift that will be given them
11|100|That is one of the stories of the communities that We recite to you - Some of them are standing now and some already mown down
11|101|We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. Their gods on whom they called instead of Allah availed them naught when once the command of your Lord had come; they add to them naught save ruin
11|102|Even thus is your Lord´s grasp when He overtakes the communities that have done wrong; verily, His grasp is grievous, strong
11|103|Verily, in this is a sign to him who fears the torment of the Hereafter - that is a Day unto which mankind shall be gathered, and that is a Day of Witness (a Day pointed to by events, a Day when testimony is given about the deeds of men, a Day which will)
11|104|We will delay it not, save unto an appointed time, already numbered
11|105|The Day when it comes, no soul shall speak save by His permission, and some shall be wretched and some glad
11|106|And as for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire; sighing and wailing will be their lot
11|107|Abiding therein for so long as the heavens and the earth endure; save for what your Lord wills. Verily, your Lord is Accomplisher of what He wills (or plans)
11|108|And as for those who are glad, they will be in the Garden, abiding therein so long as the heavens and the earth endure; save what your Lord wills, a gift unfailing
11|109|Be not then in doubt concerning what these men serve (or worship); they only serve as their fathers served before; and We will give them their portion undiminished
11|110|When We gave Moses the Book before, they disagreed (or disputed) concerning it. Had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from your Lord, the matter would have been decided between them; but, verily, they are still in hesitating doubt concern
11|111|But, verily, every one will your Lord surely recompense for their works; verily, He is well Informed of what they do
11|112|So stand you firm in the Straight Path, as you are commanded - you and those who turn unto Allah with you, and transgress you not. Verily, He is Seer of what you do
11|113|Lean not unto those who do wrong, lest the Fire touches you, for you have no patrons but Allah; nor shall you be helped
11|114|And be you steadfast in prayer at the two ends of the day, and the (three) watches of the night. Verily, good things annul evil things. This is a reminder for the mindful
11|115|And be you patient, for Allah wastes not the wages of those who do good
11|116|If only there had been, among the generations before you, men endowed with a remnant of virtue (balance, sobriety, righteousness, good sense) forbidding (warning, preventing) men from corruption in the earth, as did the few whom We saved from them. But th
11|117|In truth your Lord did not destroy the communities unjustly while they were doing right. (Or for a few or minor wrong-doings, or while there were few wrong-doers, or while they had the potentiality to mend)
11|118|Had your Lord pleased, He could have made men one nation; but they will not cease to dispute
11|119|Save those on whom your Lord has had mercy. For this did He create them. And the Word of your Lord is fulfiled, "Verily, I will surely fill hell with Jinns and Mankind altogether
11|120|And all that We relate to you of the stories of the Messengers in order that thereby We might make firm your heart. And herein has the truth come to you, an admonition and a reminder to the believers
11|121|Say to those who believe not, "Act according to your power, verily, we are acting too
11|122|And wait ye, verily, we are waiting too
11|123|Allah´s are the unseen things of the heavens and of the earth; and unto Him do all affairs return. So serve (worship) Him and put your trust in Him; for your Lord is not heedless of what you do
12|1|ALIF LAM RA. These are the verses (or symbols) of the Perspicuous (or clarifying) Book
12|2|Verily, We have revealed it as a Lecture (a Quran) in Arabic; per chance (or possibly) you may understand
12|3|We tell you the best (the most beautiful, appealing, enlightening) of narratives in that We inspired in you this Quran, though you were before it among the heedless
12|4|When Joseph said to his father, "O my father! Verily, I saw (in my dream) eleven stars, and the sun, and the moon - I saw them prostrating themselves unto me
12|5|He said, "O my boy! Tell not your vision to your brethren, for they will plot against you. Verily, Satan is to man an open foe
12|6|Thus your Lord will prefer you, and teach you the interpretation of events, and fulfil His favour upon you, and upon the family of Jacob, as He fulfiled it upon your two forefathers, Abraham and Isaac, before you. Verily, your Lord is Knowing, Wise
12|7|In Joseph and his brethren were signs to those who inquire (or seek Truth)
12|8|When they said, "Surely, Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, though we are many. Verily, our father is in obvious aberration (wandering in mind)
12|9|Slay Joseph, or cast him out to some (far or unknown) land; that your father´s face (favour) may be free for you, and you may afterwards be a righteous folk
12|10|One from amongst them said, "Slay not Joseph, but, if you must act, throw him into the bottom of a pit; some caravan of travellers may pick him up
12|11|Said they, "O our father! What ails you that you will not trust us with Joseph seeing we are unto him sincere (well wishers)
12|12|Send him with us to-morrow to revel and to play, and, verily, we will take good care of him
12|13|Said he, "Verily, it grieves me that you should take him with you, for I fear lest the wolf devour him while you take no heed
12|14|Said they, "Why, if the wolf should devour him while we are so (strong) a band, verily, then we should ourselves have perished first
12|15|And when they had gone off with him and agreed to put him in the depths of a pit, We inspired him, "Thou shall surely remind them of this affair of theirs when they know you not
12|16|And they came to their father in the evening weeping
12|17|And they said, "O our father! Verily, we went forth to race and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf devoured him, but you will not believe us though we speak the truth
12|18|And they brought his shirt with false blood upon it. Said he, "Nay, but your souls have beguiled you into some deed; but patience is more fitting for me. And Allah alone is He whose aid is to be sought against that which you describe
12|19|And a caravan of travellers came and sent their water-drawer. He let down his bucket into the pit. Said he, "What good luck! Here is a youth." So they concealed him, as a treasure, and Allah was Aware of what they did
12|20|And they sold him for a mean price, a few dirham counted out- in such low estimation did they hold him
12|21|And the man from Egypt who had bought him said to his wife, "Make his stay with us honourable; it may be he will be of use to us, or we may adopt him as a son." Thus did We establish Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation
12|22|And when he had reached maturity We gave him judgment (or wisdom or power) and knowledge, for thus do We reward those who do good and right
12|23|And she, in whose house he was, desired to seduce him for his person (or body, or away from his true self); and she locked the doors and said, "Come you (to me)!" Said he, "I seek refuge in Allah (Allah forbid)! Verily, he (your husband) is
12|24|And she desired (lusted after) him, and he would have desired her, had it not been that he saw the argument (or evidence) of his Lord; thus did We ordain that We might turn away evil and lewdness from him; for verily, he was one of our servants, sincere a
12|25|And they raced to the door and she rent his shirt from behind; and they met her lord (husband) at the door. Said she, "What else is the recompense for him who wishes evil for your family, but prison or a grievous doom
12|26|Said he (Joseph), "She it was who sought to seduce me for my person (or from my true self)." And one from among her family saw this and bore witness thus "If his shirt be rent from in front, then she speaks the truth and he is of the liars
12|27|But if his shirt be rent from behind, then she lies and he is of the truthful
12|28|And when he saw his shirt rent from behind he (her husband) said, "This is one of the guiles (or tricks) of you women; verily, your tricks are great
12|29|O Joseph! Turn aside from this (pass it over). And do you, woman, ask pardon for your fault; for truly, you are of the sinful
12|30|And some women in the city said, "The wife of the King´s Minister seeks to seduce her slave for his person; truly, he has infatuated (smitten) her with lust: verily, we see her in manifest error
12|31|And when she heard of their malicious talk, she sent for them, and prepared for them a banquet, and gave each of them a knife; and she said (to Joseph), "Come forth to them!" And when they saw him they exalted (admired) him and cut their hands e
12|32|Said she, "There before you is he about whom you blamed me. I did seek to seduce him for his person, but he did save himself firmly, guiltless. But now if he does not what I bid him he shall surely be cast into prison and shall surely be among those
12|33|Said he, "O My Lord! Prison is dearer to me than what they call on me to do; and unless you turn from me their wiles I shall incline unto them and shall be among the foolish
12|34|And his Lord answered him and turned from him their wiles; verily, He is Hearer, Knower
12|35|Then it appeared good to them, even after they had seen the signs (of his innocence), to imprison him for a time
12|36|And two young men went to prison with him. Said one of them, "Verily, I dreamt that I was pressing wine." And the other said, "Verily, I dreamt that I was bearing on my head loaves from which the birds did eat." "Tell us" (th)
12|37|He said, "I shall tell you both of its interpretation before your daily meal is brought to you. That is (some) of what my Lord has taught me; verily, I have forsaken the faith of a people who believe not in Allah, and disbelieve in the Hereafter
12|38|And I have followed the faith of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was for us to associate aught as partners with Allah. This is of the Bounty (or Grace) from Allah upon us and upon mankind: but most men give not thanks
12|39|O you two fellow-prisoners! Are manifold lords better, or Allah, the One, the Almighty
12|40|What you worship beside Him are naught but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. Judgment rests with Allah only, who commands you to worship none but Him. That is the right religion, but most men kno
12|41|O you two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he shall pour out wine for his lord to drink: and as for the other, he shall be crucified, and the birds shall eat from his head. Thus is the matter decreed whereof you did inquire
12|42|And he said to him of the two whom he knew would escape, "Remember me with your Lord!" But Satan made him forget to mention him to his lord, so he (Joseph) lingered in prison for a few more years
12|43|And the king said, "Verily, I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean kine devoured; and seven green ears of corn and (seven) others dry. O you chiefs! Explain to me my vision, if dreams you can interpret
12|44|Said they, "Confused dreams! And naught know we of the interpretation of such dreams
12|45|Then he of the twain who had escaped, remembered after a while, and said, "Verily, I will inform you of the interpretation thereof, so send me forth
12|46|(When he came to Joseph, he said) "Joseph! O you truthful one! Explain to us the seven fat kine which seven lean ones devoured; and the seven green ears of corn and others dry that I may return to the people, per chance (or possibly) they then may kn
12|47|He said, "You shall sow for seven years, as is your wont; but what you reap, leave it in the ear, except a little whereof you eat
12|48|Then there shall come after that seven severe years which shall devour what you have put by before for them, save a little which you shall preserve
12|49|Then there will come after that a year in which the people shall have abundant rain and in which they shall press (wine and oil)
12|50|Then the king (after he had been told) said, "Bring him (Joseph) unto me." And when the messenger came unto him, Joseph said, "Return to your Lord, and ask him, what is the state of mind of the women who cut their hands? Verily, my lord kno
12|51|He (the king sent for the women and) said, "What happened when you sought to seduce Joseph?" They said, "Allah preserve us! We know no evil of him." Said the wife of the Minister, "Now is the truth exposed! It was I who sought to
12|52|(The wife said) "This, I asked that he (my lord) might know that I did not betray him in his absence, and that Allah guides not the guile of the betrayers
12|53|Yet I do not absolve myself, for the human soul is prone to evil, save that on which my Lord has mercy; verily, my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful
12|54|And the king said, "Bring him (Joseph) to me. I will give him a special position with myself." And when he had spoken with him he said, "Verily, to-day you are with us in a well established place of trust
12|55|He said, "Place me over the store-house of the land; verily, I will be an expert custodian. (one who is skilled and knows what is required)
12|56|Thus did We establish Joseph in the land that he might possess (settle or control) what part (in the manner, time and place) he pleases. We reach with Our mercy whom We will. We waste not the wages of those who do right
12|57|Surely the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and fears (ward off evil or are constant in righteousness)
12|58|And his brethren came to Joseph, and they presented themselves unto him and he knew them, but they recognised him not
12|59|And when he had given them their provisions he said, "Bring me your brother that you have from your father (but different mothers). Do you not see that I give good measure, and that I am the best of hosts
12|60|But if you bring him not to me, no measure shall you have with me, nor shall you come nigh me
12|61|They said, "We will beg him from our father, and we will surely do it
12|62|Then he said to his servants, "Put their merchandise (they brought in payment) back into their packs, so that they may discover it only when they have returned to their family; per chance (or possibly) they may return
12|63|And when they returned to their father, they said, "O our father! A measure is withheld from us; so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure, and, verily, we will guard him well
12|64|He said, "Shall I entrust you with him with results other than when I entrusted you with his brother before him? But Allah is the best of keepers, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful
12|65|And when they opened their packs they found their merchandise restored to them. Said they, "O our father! What more can we crave? Here are our goods restored to us. We shall get provisions for our folk, and we shall guard our brother, and shall have
12|66|He said, "I will by no means send him with you until you give me a solemn oath - In the name of Allah that you will surely bring him back to me, unless you are yourselves besieged (made powerless)." So when they had sworn their oaths he said, &q
12|67|And he said further, "O my sons! Enter not by one gate, but enter by several gates. Not that I can avail you aught against Allah. Lo! Judgment (decision, command) rests only with Allah. In Him do I put my trust, and on Him do the trusting rely
12|68|And when they had entered as their father bade them, it availed them nothing against (the plan of) Allah. It fulfiled but a want in Jacob´s soul; for, verily, he was possessed of knowledge that We had taught him; but most of mankind know not
12|69|And when they entered into the presence of Joseph, he took his brother to stay with him, and said, "Verily, I, even I, am your brother, so sorrow not for their doings (past, present and future)
12|70|And when he had given them their provisions, he placed the drinking cup in his brother´s pack; then a crier shouted out, "O you in the caravan! Verily, you are thieves
12|71|They said, turning to them, "What is it that you miss
12|72|Said they, "We miss the goblet of the king, and whoever brings it shall have a camel-load, and I will be bound by it (the promise)
12|73|They said, "By Allah! You knew we came not to do evil in the land, and that we were not thieves

14|5|We did send Moses with our signs, saying, "Bring forth your people from the darkness into the light, and remind them of the Days of Allah!" Verily, in that are signs to every patient, grateful one

14|25|It gives its fruit at every season by the permission of its Lord - Allah strikes out parables for men that per chance (or possibly) they may reflect (or be mindful)
14|26|And the similitude of a bad saying is as a bad tree, which is felled from above the earth, possessing no stability
14|27|Allah answers (confirms, establishes) those who believe with the firm (sure) word in the life of this world and in the Hereafter; but Allah leads the wrong-doers astray; for Allah does what He will

15|26|And We did create man from potter´s (or sound emitting) clay of black mud wrought into form
15|27|And the jinn We created before of smokeless fire (or scorched wind)
15|28|When your Lord said to the angels, "Verily, I am creating a mortal from (sound-emitting) clay of black mud wrought into shape

15|65|Travel then with your household in the deep darkness of the night, and follow you their rear; and let not any one of you turn round to look back; but go on to where you are commanded
15|66|And We made plain for him the decree that the uttermost one of these people should be cut off on the morrow
15|67|Then the people of the city came, glad at the tidings (of the arrival of the young men)
15|68|Said Lot, "Verily, these are my guests, therefore disgrace me not
15|69|But fear Allah, and put me not to shame
15|70|They said, "Have we not forbidden you to speak for all in the world
15|71|He said, "Here are my daughters, if do it you must
15|72|By your life (O Muhammad)! In their frenzy of intoxication (passion) they went blindly (distractedly) to and fro
15|73|And the mighty blast caught them at dawn
15|74|And We turned their cities upside down, and rained down on them brimstones hard as baked clay
15|75|Behold! In this is a sign to those who by tokens understand (or can read the signs)
15|76|And, verily, the cities were on a high road that still remains
15|77|Verily, in this is a sign for those who believe
15|78|And the companions of the Wood (Midian), too, were unjust
15|79|And We took vengeance on them, and, verily, they were both on an open highway, plain to see
15|80|And the companions of Al-Hijr (the Rocky Tract) also rejected the messengers
15|81|And We brought them Our revelations, but they did turn away there from
15|82|And they used to hew out dwellings from the mountain to dwell in safety
15|83|But the mighty blast seized them in the morning
15|84|And that which they counted as gain availed them naught
15|85|We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them both, save with truth. And, verily, the Hour is surely coming; then do you forgive with a gracious forgiveness
15|86|Verily, your Lord He is the Master Creator, the All-knowing
15|87|We have already given you the Seven Oft-Repeated (the verses of the first chapter of the Quran), and the mighty Quran
15|88|Let not your eyes strain after what We have allowed certain classes among them to enjoy, nor grieve for them; but lower your wing (in tenderness) to the believers
15|89|And say, "Verily, I, even I, am a plain Warner
15|90|Such as We sent down for those who make divisions
15|91|Those who break the Quran into separate parts
15|92|Them, by your Lord! We shall question, one and all
15|93|About what they used to do
15|94|Therefore, proclaim what you are commanded, and withdraw from the idolaters
15|95|Verily, We are enough defence for you against the scoffers
15|96|Who place other gods along with Allah; but they at length shall come to know
15|97|And well know We that your breast was at times oppressed by what they say
15|98|But hymn the praises of your Lord, and be you of those who make prostrations (or obeisance)
15|99|And serve your Lord until there comes unto you the Hour that is certain (death)
16|1|The Command of Allah will inevitably come to pass; seek not then to hasten it. Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they join with Him
16|2|He sends down the angels with the Spirit at His command upon whom He will of His servants, saying, "Give warning that there is no God but Me; therefore, fear (do your duty to) Me
16|3|He created the heavens and the earth with truth! Exalted is He above all that which they join with Him
16|4|He created man from a drop (of sperm); and yet, behold, he is an open opponent
16|5|The cattle too have We created for you; in them is warmth (clothing) and profit (benefits, uses) and from them do you eat
16|6|In them there is beauty for you when you drive them home to rest, and when you drive them forth to pasture
16|7|And they bear your heavy burdens to lands which you could not otherwise reach, except with souls distressed; - verily, your Lord is Kind and Merciful
16|8|And horses too, and mules, and asses, for you to ride upon and for an ornament. He has creates also that which you know not
16|9|(Unto or For Allah) is the direction of the Straight Way; from it some turn aside (or are not straight): but had He pleased He would have led you all straight
16|10|He it is who sends down water from the sky, whence you have drink, and whence the trees grow whereby you feed your flocks
16|11|He makes the corn to grow, and the olives, and the palms, and the grapes, and all kinds of other fruit; - verily, herein is indeed a sign for a people who reflect
16|12|And He subjected to you the night and the day, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars are subjected to His command. Verily, in these are signs to a people who have sense (sensibility or wisdom)
16|13|And what He has produced for you in the earth varying in hue (colours and qualities), verily, in that is a sign for a people who are mindful (aware. remembering, grateful)
16|14|He it is who has subjected the sea, that you may eat fresh flesh there from; and you bring forth from it ornaments which you wear,- and you may see the ships cleaving through it, and that you may search after His Bounty, and per chance (or possibly) you m
16|15|And He has cast firm mountains on the earth lest it shake with you; and rivers and roads; per chance (or possibly) you may be guided
16|16|And landmarks; and by the stars too are they guided
16|17|Is He who creates like him who creates not? Will you then not remember (be mindful, aware)
16|18|But if you would number the favours of Allah, you cannot count them. Verily, Allah is Forgiving, Merciful
16|19|Allah knows what you keep secret (or hidden), and what you disclose (or proclaim)
16|20|And those on whom you call beside Allah cannot create anything, for they are themselves created
16|21|Dead, not living, nor can they know when they shall be raised
16|22|Your God is one God, and those who believe not in the Hereafter their heart are given to denial, and they are inflated with pride
16|23|Without a doubt Allah knows what you keep secret and what you disclose. Verily, He loves not those inflated with pride
16|24|And when it is said to them, "What is it that your Lord has revealed (sent down)?" they say, "Old folks´ tales
16|25|Let them bear the burden of their sins in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also some of the burdens of those whom they led astray without knowledge. Alas! How grievous is the burden they shall bear
16|26|Those who were before them plotted, but Allah struck at the foundations of their building, and the roof fell on them from above, and the torment came to them, from whence they could not perceive
16|27|Then on the Day of Resurrection He will put them to shame, and say, "Where are My associates about whom you were divided into parties?" Those endowed with knowledge will say, "Verily, to-day disgrace, and evil cover the disbelievers
16|28|Those whom the angels take away while they are wronging their own souls." Then will they offer peace and surrender, saying "We have done no evil (knowingly)." (The reply will be) "Nay! Surely Allah knows what you used to do
16|29|So enter you the doors of hell, to dwell therein; ill, indeed, is the resort of the arrogant
16|30|And it will be said to those who fear Allah (the righteous), "What is it that your Lord has revealed (sent down)?" They will say, "All that is good." For those who do good, there is good in this world; but certainly the abode of the He
16|31|Gardens of Eternity which they shall enter, beneath which rivers flow; therein shall they have what they please; - thus does Allah reward those who fear Him (or repel evil)
16|32|To those whom the angels take away in a goodly state (those who die righteous) they shall say, "Peace be upon you! Enter you into the Garden (Paradise) for that which you have done
16|33|Do they expect other than that the angels should come to take them away, or that your Lord´s command should come to pass? Even so did those before them; Allah did not wrong them; but it was themselves they wronged
16|34|So that the evil which they had done smote them, and that which they mocked surrounded (imprisoned, restricted, hemmed them in)
16|35|And the idolaters (those who associated others with Allah) said, "Had Allah pleased we had not served aught beside Him, neither we nor our fathers; nor had we forbidden aught without His permission". Even so did those before them. Are the messen
16|36|Verily, We have sent to every nation a Messenger, proclaiming, "Serve you Allah, and avoid Taghut (false gods)." And amongst them are some whom Allah has guided, and amongst them are some for whom error has become established. So travel through
16|37|If you are eager for their guidance, verily, Allah guides not those who go astray (or mislead), nor have they any helpers
16|38|They swear by their strongest oath, "Allah will not raise up him who dies."- Nay! But it is a promise binding on Him in truth. But most know not
16|39|(It is) To explain to them that which they disputed about, and that those who disbelieved may know that they are liars
16|40|We only say unto a thing We intend, the Word, "BE," and it is
16|41|But those who fled their homes for Allah´s sake, after they were wronged (oppressed), We will surely establish them in this world with good things; but truly the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if you did but know
16|42|Those who are patient, and put their trust (or reliance) upon their Lord
16|43|And We have not sent before you any but men, whom We inspired - Ask you those who possess the Reminder (or the Message), if you know not yourselves
16|44|With Manifest (clear) Signs and with Books of Prophecy; and We have sent down the Reminder to you too, that you may explain to men clearly what has been sent down to them, and that they may reflect
16|45|Are those, who devise evil plots, secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up, or that His Wrath will not seize them from whence they cannot perceive
16|46|Or that He may not call them to account in the midst of their going to and fro, without the possibility of frustrating Him
16|47|Or that He should seize them with a gradual wasting? Verily, your Lord is indeed Kind, Merciful
16|48|Do they not look at Allah´s creations, even among (inanimate things) - how their shadows turn to the right or the left, in prostration (obeisance or submission) to Allah and they are humble (or shrinking)
16|49|And unto Allah does prostration (obeisance) whatever is in the heavens and in the earth, whether living creature or angel; nor are they arrogant (inflated with pride)
16|50|They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded
16|51|And Allah says, "Take not two gods; He is only one God; then fear Me, and Me alone
16|52|To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and in the earth, and to Him is duty (obedience) due unceasingly (or religion is for Him fundamentally and forever). Will you then fear other than Allah
16|53|And whatever favours you enjoy, they are from Allah; then, whenever distress touches you, unto Him you turn for succour
16|54|Yet, when He removes the distress from you, lo! A party of you join partners with their Lord
16|55|That they may deny that which We have given them. Then enjoy life while you may, for at length you shall come to know the truth
16|56|And they set aside a portion of what We have bestowed upon them for what they know not. By Allah! You shall certainly be questioned concerning that which you have devised
16|57|They assign for Allah daughters - Glory be to Him - and for themselves they desire them not (or desire sons)
16|58|When any one of them receives tidings of a female child, his face is over clouded and black, and he is filled with inner wrath
16|59|He skulks away from the people, for the evil tidings he has heard; - is he to keep it with its disgrace, or to bury it in the dust? - Ah! How evil is their judgment (or choice)
16|60|For those who believe not in the Hereafter is there is an evil similitude: but Allah´s is the Sublime Similitude; for He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise
16|61|If Allah were to punish men for their wrong-doing He would not leave upon the earth a single living creature; but He reprieves them until an appointed time; and when their time comes they cannot put it off an hour, nor can they advance it
16|62|They assign to Allah what they abhor themselves; and their tongues expound the lie that all good is to be theirs." Without a doubt theirs is the Fire, for, verily, they shall be abandoned therein
16|63|By Allah! We verily sent messengers unto the nations before you, but Satan made their works fair-seeming unto them. So he is their patron this day, and for them is grievous doom
16|64|We have revealed the Book unto you only that you may explain unto them that wherein they differ, and as a guidance and a mercy to a people who have faith
16|65|And Allah sends down water from the sky, and quickens therewith the earth after its death; verily, in that is a sign to a people who can hear
16|66|Verily, you have in cattle a lesson; We give you to drink from that which is in their belly, betwixt excretions and blood, pure milk, agreeable for drinkers
16|67|And of the fruit of the palms and the grapes you derive drinks and goodly nourishment; verily, in that is a sign to a people who have sense
16|68|And your Lord inspired the bee, "Take to habitations in the mountains and in the trees, and in the habitations of men
16|69|Then eat from every fruit, and walk in the beaten paths of your Lord". There comes forth from her body a draught varying in hue, in which is a healing for mankind. Verily, herein are, indeed, signs unto a people who reflect
16|70|Allah created you; then He will take you to Himself; but amongst you are some whom He will thrust into the most decrepit stage of life, so that he may not know aught that once he knew. Verily, Allah is Knower, Powerful
16|71|And Allah has bestowed his gifts of provisions more freely on some of you over others; but those who have been preferred will not restore their provision to those whom their right hands possess that they may share equally therein: - is it Allah´s favours they deny
16|72|And Allah has made for you mates of your own nature, and has made for you from them sons and daughters and grandchildren; and has provided you with sustenance of the best things; - is it, then in vanity that they believe, while for Allah´s favour th
16|73|And they serve beside Allah what cannot control for them any provision from the heavens or the earth, nor have they any power
16|74|Do not then coin similitudes for Allah! Verily, Allah knows, but you know not
16|75|Allah coins a similitude (or parable); (On the one hand) a slave owned by another, having control over nothing, and (on the other hand) one on whom We have bestowed a goodly favours from Us, and who spends there from freely secretly and openly - shall the
16|76|And Allah coins another similitude (parable): two men, one of them dumb, able to do nothing, a burden to his lord; wherever he directs him he brings no success; is he to be held equal with him who bids what is just and who is on the Straight Way
16|77|To Allah belongs the Mystery of the heavens and the earth. And the Decision of the Hour (of Judgment) is but as the twinkling of an eye, or even quicker. Verily, Allah has power over all things
16|78|Allah brings you forth out of the wombs of your mothers knowing naught; and He gives you hearing, and sight, and heart, that you may give thanks
16|79|Do they not see the birds subservient in the vault of the sky? None holds them in but Allah: verily, in that is a sign unto a people who believe
16|80|Allah made for you habitations, homes of repose; and made for you, of the skins of cattle, dwellings (tents), that you may find them light on the day you move your quarters and the day when you abide; and from their wool and from their fur, and from their
16|81|And Allah has made for you, out what He has created, shade; and has made for you shelters in the mountains; and He has made for you garments to protect you from the heat, and coats of mail to keep you from each other´s violence: - thus does He fulfi
16|82|But if they turn their backs, your duty is only to convey the Clear Message
16|83|They recognize the favours of Allah, and then they deny them, for most men are ungrateful
16|84|On the Day We shall raise from all peoples a witness; then shall no excuse be accepted from disbelievers, and they shall receive no favours (or be allowed to make amends)
16|85|And when those who did wrong see the Penalty, it will not be mitigated, nor will they receive respite
16|86|And when those who join partners with Allah behold those partners, they will say, "Our Lord! These are your partners on whom we used to invoke beside Thee." And they shall throw back the words at them, "Verily, you are liars
16|87|And they shall proffer unto Allah surrender that day; and all that which they had devised shall stray away from them
16|88|Those who disbelieve and turn folks from the path of Allah, We will add doom to their doom, for that they worked corruption
16|89|And on the day when We will raise up in every nation a witness against them from among themselves, and We will bring you (Muhammad) as a witness against these (your people or the other witnesses); for We have revealed (sent down) to you a Book (Scripture)
16|90|Verily, Allah commands justice, the doing of good (kindness, benevolence), and liberality to kindred, and He forbids all shameful deeds (lewdness, abomination, perversity) and wickedness (wrong, injustice, oppression, rebellion); He exhorts you that per c
16|91|Fulfil the Covenant of Allah when you have entered into it, and break not your oaths after confirming them, for you thereby make Allah your surety; verily, Allah knows what you do
16|92|And be not like her who unravels her yarn, fraying it out after she hath spun it close, by taking your oaths for mutual intrigue, because one nation is more numerous than another; Allah only tries you therewith, but He will make manifest to you on the Day
16|93|But had Allah pleased He would have made you one nation; but He leads astray whom He will, and guides whom He will; - but you shall be questioned as to that which you used to do
16|94|Take not therefore your oaths for mutual deceit, lest a foot slip after being planted firmly, and you taste of evil in that you turned folks off the path of Allah, and your s should be a mighty doom
16|95|And sell not the Covenant of Allah for a little price; Verily, with Allah alone is that which is better for you, if you did but know
16|96|What you have is spent (wastes away), but what Allah has endures; and verily, We will recompense the patient (steadfast) in proportion to the best of what they used to do
16|97|Whoever acts aright, male or female, and is a believer, We will quicken with a goodly life; and We will recompense them in proportion to the best of what they used to do
16|98|When you do read the Quran ask refuge with Allah from Satan the outcast (the rejected or pelted one)
16|99|Verily, he has no power over those who believe and who upon their Lord rely (trust)
16|100|His power is only over those who take him for a patron, and over the idolaters
16|101|And whenever We change one revelation for another - Allah knows best what He reveals (sends down) - They say, "You are but inventing!"- Nay, most of them know not
16|102|Say, "The Holy Spirit brought it down from your Lord in truth, that it may confirm (the faith of) those who believe, and for a guidance and glad tidings to those who have Surrendered unto Allah (Muslims)
16|103|We know well that they say, "It is only some mortal who teaches him." But the tongue of him they point to (Muhammad) is outlandish, while this (Quran) is Arabic, pure and clear
16|104|Verily, those who believe not in Allah´s signs, Allah will not guide them, and for them is grievous woe
16|105|Only they are the inventors who believe not in Allah´s signs; and these, they are the liars
16|106|Whoever disbelieves in Allah after having believed - unless it be one who is forced and whose heart is still content in the faith - but whoever expands his breast to (easing) disbelieve - on them is wrath from Allah, and theirs is a mighty doom
16|107|That is because they preferred the love of the life of this world to the Hereafter, and because Allah guides not unbelieving people
16|108|These are they whose heart, and hearing, and sight, Allah has sealed, and these, they are the heedless
16|109|Assuredly, in the Hereafter they will be the losers
16|110|Then, verily, your Lord - to those who fled after they had been tried, and then fought strenuously and were patient, - verily, your Lord after that will be Forgiving and Merciful
16|111|On the Day when every soul will come to plead for itself, every soul shall be paid what it has earned, and they shall not be wronged
16|112|Allah coins a similitude (parable): a city which was safe and content, its provision came to it in plenty from every place, and then it denied (was ungrateful for) Allah´s favours, and Allah made it feel the garb of dearth and fear, because of that
16|113|And there came to them a messenger from amongst themselves, but they called him a liar, so the torment seized them, while yet they were unjust
16|114|Eat, then, from what Allah has provided you, things lawful and good, and give thanks for the favours of Allah, if it be Him you serve
16|115|He has only forbidden you carrion, and blood, and the flesh of swine, and that which is devoted to other than Allah; but he who is driven thereto (forced by necessity), neither craving nor transgressing due limits, then verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merc
16|116|And say not of what your own tongues pronounce, the lie "This is lawful, and this is unlawful," inventing against Allah a lie; verily, those who invent against Allah a lie shall not prosper
16|117|A brief enjoyment for them - then a grievous woe
16|118|For those who are Jews We have forbidden what We have already narrated to you. We wronged them not, but they were wont to wrong themselves
16|119|Then, verily, your Lord - for those who do evil in ignorance and afterwards repent and amend - verily, your Lord is indeed Forgiving and Merciful
16|120|Verily, Abraham was indeed, a model, devoutly obedient to Allah, by nature upright, and he was not of the idolaters
16|121|Thankful for His favours; He chose him and He guided him unto the Straight Way
16|122|And We gave him in this world good things; and, verily, in the Hereafter he is among the righteous
16|123|Then We inspired you (Muhammad) saying, "Follow the religion of Abraham, as one by nature upright. He was not of the idolaters
16|124|The Sabbath was only made (strict) for those who dispute thereon; but, verily, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Judgment concerning that whereon they do dispute
16|125|Call unto the way of your Lord with wisdom and goodly exhortation, and reason with them in the best (kindest, most gracious, elegant, persuasive) way; verily, your Lord He knows best who has erred from His way, and He is best aware of those who receive gu
16|126|But if you punish (or catch them out), punish (or catch them out) only with the like of that with which you were afflicted; but if you endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient
16|127|Endure you patiently. Your endurance is only by the help of Allah. Grieve not about them; and be not distressed because of that which they devise
16|128|Verily, Allah is with those who fear (do their duty to) Him, and with those who do good
17|1|Glorified be He Who carried His servant on a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the Remote Mosque, the neighbourhood of which We have blessed, to show him of Our Signs. Verily, He is the Hearer and the Seer
17|2|And We gave Moses the Book (Scripture) and made it a guidance to the Children of Israel, saying: "Take you no guardian besides Me
17|3|(They were) The seed of those We carried with Noah (in the ark). Verily, he was a thankful servant
17|4|And We clearly warned the Children of Israel in the Book, "You shall verily do evil in the earth twice, and you shall become great tyrants (or elated with pride)
17|5|And when the first of the two came, We sent against you Our servants given to great violence. They entered the inner most parts of your homes; and it was a fulfiled warning
17|6|Then We rallied you once more against them, and aided you with resources and sons, and made you a numerous band
17|7|If you do well, you do well to your own souls; and if you do evil, you do it against your own souls. And when the second warning came, We permitted your enemies to disfigure your faces and to enter your Temple as they had entered it the first time, and to
17|8|It may be that your Lord will yet have mercy on you. But if you revert to wrongdoing We will revert to punishment, and We have made Hell a prison for the faithless
17|9|Verily, this Quran does guide to the Straight Way, and gives glad tidings to the believers who do work righteousness, that for them is a great reward
17|10|And that for those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have prepared a mighty doom
17|11|Man prays for evil as (or when) he prays for good (or he makes his prayer evil or prays for evil when it should be for good); for man was ever hasty (or impatient or superficial)
17|12|We made the night and the day two signs; and We make dark the sign of the night and make the sign of the day sight-giving, that you may seek the bounty of your Lord, and that you may calculate the years and the reckoning; and We have expounded everything
17|13|And every man´s augury (fate) have We fastened on his own neck; and We will bring forth for him on the Day of Judgment a book offered to him wide open
17|14|(It will be said to him) "Read your book. Your soul suffices as reckoner against you this day
17|15|He who accepts guidance (or does right), accepts it only for his own soul: and he who errs, errs only against it; nor shall one burdened soul bear the burden of another. Nor would We punish until we had sent a Messenger (with warnings)
17|16|And when We desire to destroy a people We send commands to the opulent ones thereof who yet work abomination therein; and then due sentence is pronounced; and We destroyed it utterly
17|17|How many generations have We destroyed after Noah. Your Lord is sufficient as Knower and Beholder of the sins of his servant
17|18|Whoever is desirous of this life that soon passes away, We will hasten on for him therein what We please for whom We please. Then We will make hell for him to broil in - despised and outcast (or condemned, disgraced and rejected)
17|19|But whoever desires the Hereafter, and strives for it with the necessary effort, for such, their striving shall find favour
17|20|To each do We supply, both these and those (the just and the unjust), from the bounty of your Lord; for the bounty of your Lord are not restricted
17|21|See how We have preferred some of them over others, and verily, the Hereafter will be greater in degree and greater in preference
17|22|Set not up with Allah other gods, or you will sit despised and forsaken
17|23|Your Lord has decreed that you serve none other than Him; and that you show kindness to parents. If one or both of them reach old age with you, say not unto them, "Fie!", nor repulse them, but speak to them graciously and kindly
17|24|And lower to them the wing of humility out of compassion, and say, "O Lord! Have compassion on them both for they did take care of me when I was little
17|25|Your Lord is best aware of what is in your souls. If you be righteous, lo! He was ever Forgiving unto those who turn back penitent
17|26|And give your kinsman his due and the needy and the son of the road (wayfarer); and squander (waste) not your wealth in wantonness
17|27|Lo! The squanderers were ever brothers of the devil; and the devil is ever ungrateful to his Lord
17|28|But if you do turn away from them to seek after mercy from your Lord, which you hope for, then speak to them in easy words (kindly and reasonably)
17|29|Let not your hand be fettered to your neck (i.e. selfish and tight fisted), nor yet spread it out quite open, lest you should have to sit down blamed and destitute
17|30|Verily, your Lord spreads out provision to whomsoever He will or He restricts it. Verily, He is ever Knower and Seer of his servants
17|31|And slay not your children for fear of poverty; We will provide for them and for you. Beware! For to slay them is ever a Great Sin
17|32|And draw not near to adultery (and fornication); verily, it is ever an abomination, and evil is the way thereof (it opens the way to other evils)
17|33|And slay not the soul that Allah has forbidden you (or made sacred), except for just cause; for he who is slain unjustly We have given authority to his heirs (or kin), yet let him not commit excess in slaying; verily, he will be helped
17|34|And draw not near to the wealth of the orphan, save to improve it, until he reaches the age of puberty, and fulfil your covenants (or agreements, contracts etc.). Verily, every covenant will be inquired into (on the Day of Judgment)
17|35|And give full measure when you measure out, and weigh with a right balance; that is better and fairer in the final determination
17|36|And follow (or pursue) not that of which you have no knowledge; verily, the hearing, the sight, and the heart, of all of these it shall be asked (to give an account)
17|37|And walk not on the earth proudly (insolently); verily, you can not rend the earth asunder, nor can you stretch to the height of the mountains
17|38|All this evil is abhorrent in the sight of your Lord
17|39|These are among the things of wisdom which your Lord has inspired you with. Take not then with Allah other gods (objects of worship), lest you should be thrown into Hell reproached and outcast (rejected)
17|40|What! Has your Lord preferred for you sons, and taken for Himself daughters from among the angels? Truly, you are uttering a dreadful saying
17|41|Now have We explained in various ways in this Quran in order that they may receive admonition, but it only increases them in naught but aversion (or flight from truth)
17|42|Say, "Were there with Him other gods, as you say, then would they seek a way against (or to) the Lord of the Throne
17|43|Glory to Him! High is He, far exalted above all they say
17|44|The seven heavens and the earth, and all that is therein praises Him (declares His Glory), and there is naught but hymns (celebrates, expresses) His praise: but you understand not their praise. Verily, He is Clement and Forgiving
17|45|And when you read the Quran We place between you and those who believe not in the Hereafter an invisible veil (or hidden barrier)
17|46|And We place covers upon their heart, lest they should understand it, and deafness in their ears. And when you do mention your Lord alone in the Quran they turn their backs in aversion
17|47|We know best what they listen for when they give ear to you; and when they whisper apart (or meet in secret or private discussions or conferences) when the wrong-doers say, "You only follow a man bewitched
17|48|Behold, what similitudes they strike out for you, but they err (or have gone astray), and cannot find the way
17|49|They say, "What! When we have become bones and dust are we to be raised up a new creature
17|50|Say, "Be you stones, or iron
17|51|Or a created thing which, in your mind, is greater (or harder to reproduce) yet you shall be raised" Then they shall say, "Who is to restore us?" Say, "He who originated you at first;" Then they will wag their heads and say
17|52|The day when He shall call on you and you shall answer with praise to Him, they will think that they have tarried but a little while
17|53|And tell My servants to speak only that which is best (kindly, reasonably, truthfully, beautifully, usefully to enemy, friend and relative). Truly, Satan does sow dissension (or ill will) among them, for Satan is ever unto man an open foe
17|54|Your Lord is best aware; if He please He will have mercy upon you, or if He please He will punish you. We have not sent you to take charge of them
17|55|And your Lord is best aware of all who are in the heavens and the earth. We preferred (or bestowed on) some of the prophets more (and different gifts) than on others, and to David did We give the Psalms
17|56|Say, "Call on those other than Allah whom you assume to be gods." But they have no power to remove distress from you, nor to change it
17|57|Those on whom they call, themselves seek for a means of approaching to their Lord, to see which of them is nearest: and they hope for His mercy and they fear His doom; verily, the doom of your Lord is to be shunned
17|58|There is no community but We will destroy it before the Day of Judgment, or punish it with dire penalty. That is inscribed in the Eternal Book
17|59|Naught hindered us from sending you with signs, save that those of yore denied them; so We gave Thamud the visible she-camel, but they treated her wrongfully (or ignorantly) and We send not (or any one with) signs save to warn
17|60|And when We said to you, "Verily, your Lord encompasses mankind!" and We granted the Vision which We showed you only as a trial unto men - and also the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Quran (See 44:43-49, 37:62-65); for We put warning (or fright)
17|61|And when We said to the angels, "Bow down before Adam;" and they bowed, save Iblis, who said, "Am I to bow before one whom Thou hast created out of clay (rigid and inert)
17|62|Said he, "Do you see this one whom Thou hast honoured above me? Verily, if Thou should reprieve me until the Day of Resurrection (or Judgment), I will of a surety utterly destroy his seed except a few
17|63|He (Allah) said, "Be gone and whoever of them follows you. Verily, hell is your recompense, an ample recompense
17|64|Entice away whomever of them you can with your voice; and urge your horse and your foot against them; and share with them in their wealth and their children; and make them promises. But Satan promises them naught but deceit
17|65|Verily, over My servants, you have no authority, and your Lord is guardian enough over them
17|66|It is your Lord who drives the ships for you upon the sea that you may seek of His bounty. Verily, He is ever Merciful towards you
17|67|And when distress touches you in the sea, all those whom you call on fail you, except Him, but when He has brought you safe to shore, you turn away; for man is ever ungrateful
17|68|Are ye, then sure (do you feel secure) that He will not cause a slope of the land to swallow you, or set upon you a heavy sand-storm, and then you will find no protector
17|69|Or are you sure that He will not send you back therein another time, and send against you a violent wind, and drown you for your thanklessness, and then you will find no helper against Us therein
17|70|But We have been gracious to the children of Adam, and We have borne them by land and sea, and have provided them with good things, and have preferred them over many that We have created
17|71|On the Day when We will summon all men by their record (or leaders or scriptures); and he whose book (of records) is given in his right hand shall read it (with joy), nor shall they be wronged a straw
17|72|But he who in this life is blind shall be blind in the Hereafter, and err farther from the way
17|73|They strove hard to beguile you from what We inspired you with, that you should invent against Us something else, and then they would have taken you for a friend
17|74|And had it not been that We made you firm, you would have almost inclined towards them a little (made concessions, compromises)
17|75|Then would We have made you taste of punishment of both of life and death, and you would not have found a helper against Us
17|76|And they wished to scare you away from the land, to drive you forth there from; but then they would not have stayed after you except a little while
17|77|(This is) The way of those of Our prophets whom We have sent before you; and you shall find no change in Our way
17|78|Be you steadfast in prayer from the declining of the sun until the dark of the night, and the recital of the Quran at dawn; verily, the recital of the dawn is especially witnessed (or effective)
17|79|And for some part of the night, watch you therein as an extra service (or for spiritual profit). It may be that your Lord will raise you to a praised (or glorious) station
17|80|And say, "O my Lord! Make my entry be by the Gate of Truth and Honour; and make my exit be likewise by the Gate of Truth and Honour; and grant me from Thee an authority to aid me
17|81|And say, "Truth has come, and falsehood has vanished! Verily, falsehood is ever bound to vanish
17|82|And We will send down of the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to the believers, though it only increases the wrong-doers in ruin
17|83|And when We favour man he turns away and is averse, but when evil touches him he is in despair
17|84|Say, "Every one acts after his own manner, but your Lord is best aware of who is most guided on the way
17|85|They will ask you about the Spirit. Say, "The Spirit is (or comes) by the command of my Lord, and you are given but a little knowledge (or control) thereof
17|86|If We had wished We would have taken away that with which We have inspired you; then you would have found no guardian against us
17|87|Unless by a mercy from your Lord, verily, His grace towards you is great
17|88|Say, "If mankind and jinn united together to bring the like of this Quran, they could not produce its like, though they should help each other
17|89|We have displayed for mankind in this Quran all kinds of similitudes; but most of mankind refuse anything but disbelief
17|90|And they say, "We will by no means believe in you, until you cause to gush forth for us a fountain from the earth
17|91|Or there be made for you a garden of palms and grapes, and rivers come gushing out amidst them
17|92|Or you make the sky to fall down upon us in pieces, as you have warned; or you bring us Allah and the angels before us face to face
17|93|Or there be made for you a house of gold; or you climb up into the heaven; and even then We will not believe in your climbing there, until you send down on us a book that we may read!" Say, "Glory to my Lord! Am I aught but a mortal, a Messenge
17|94|Naught prevents men from believing when the guidance came to them, save their saying, "Has Allah sent a mortal for a messenger
17|95|Say, "Had there been on the earth settled angels walking about, then We would surely have sent them an angel as a messenger
17|96|Say, "Allah is sufficient witness between me and you; verily, He is Knower, Seer of His servants
17|97|He whom Allah guides, he is indeed guided; and he whom Allah leads astray, you shall never find patrons for them beside Him; and We will assemble them on the Day of Resurrection upon their faces, blind, and dumb, and deaf; their resort is Hell; whenever i
17|98|That is their reward for that they disbelieved in Our revelations, and said, "What! When we are bones and dust, shall we then be raised up a new creation
17|99|Could they not see that Allah who created the heavens and the earth is able to create the like of them, and to set for them an appointed time; there is no doubt therein? Yet the wrong-doers refuse to accept it, save ungratefully
17|100|Say, "If you did control the treasuries of the mercy of my Lord, then you would hold them back for fear of spending; for man is ever niggardly
17|101|And We did bring Moses nine manifest signs; but ask the children of Israel how he came to them, and Pharaoh said to him, "Verily, I think, O Moses! You are bewitched
17|102|He said, "In truth you know well that none sent down these signs save the Lord of the heavens and the earth as proofs; and, verily, O Pharaoh! I think you are doomed to ruin
17|103|And he desired to drive them out of the land; but We drowned him and those with him, one and all
17|104|And after him We said to the children of Israel, "Dwell you secure in the land (of promise)"; but when the promise of the Hereafter (or the second warning) comes to pass, We will bring you back as a crowd gathered out of various nations
17|105|With truth have We sent it (the Quran) down, and with truth has it descended; and We have not sent you as ought but a herald of glad tidings and a Warner
17|106|And it is a Quran which We have divided, that you may read it to mankind at intervals, and We have revealed it by successive revelations
17|107|Say, "Believe you therein, or believe not; verily, those who were given the knowledge before it, when it is read to them fall down prostrate upon their faces, adoring
17|108|Saying, "Glory to our Lord! Verily, the promise of our Lord is ever fulfiled
17|109|They fall down upon their faces weeping, and it increases their humility
17|110|Say, "Call unto Allah, or call on Rahman (the Beneficent), unto whichever you call it is the same; for His are the most beautiful names." And do not say your prayers loud-voiced, nor yet silently, but seek a way between these
17|111|And say, "Praise belongs to Allah, who has not taken to Himself a son, and He has no partner in the Sovereignty (or Dominion), nor needs He a patron to protect Him from such abasement (or from humiliation)." And magnify Him for His greatness and
18|1|Praise be to Allah, who sent down to His servant the Book, and allowed no crookedness therein
18|2|(He made it) Straight, to give warning of stern punishment from Him; and to give the glad tidings to the believers, who do what is right, that for them is a goodly reward
18|3|Wherein they shall abide forever
18|4|And to give warning to those who say, "Allah has begotten a son
18|5|That they have no knowledge thereof, nor had their fathers. Dreadful is the word that comes forth from their mouths. Verily, they speak naught but a lie
18|6|Yet it may be that you (Muhammad) will torment your soul with grief (or fret thyself to death) if they believe not in this new revelation
18|7|Verily, We have placed all that which is on the earth as an ornament thereof, that We may try them, which of them is best in conduct
18|8|But, verily, We shall make all that which is thereon a barren mound
18|9|Have you considered that the Fellows of the Cave and of the Inscription are a wonder amongst Our Signs
18|10|When the youths fled for refuge to the cave and said, "Our Lord! Bestow on us mercy from Thee, and dispose of our affair rightly (or lead us to conduct ourselves rightly)
18|11|And We struck their ears (with deafness) in the cave for a number of years
18|12|Then We raised them up again, that We might know which of the two parties could best calculate the time of their tarrying
18|13|We narrate to you their story in truth. Verily, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We added to their guidance
18|14|And We strengthened their heart, when they stood up and said, "Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, never will we call upon any god beside Him, for then we should have said an extravagant thing
18|15|These people of ours have taken to other gods beside Him. Though they do not bring any manifest authority for them. And who is more unjust than he who invents against Allah falsehoods
18|16|So when you have gone apart from them and what they serve other than Allah, then resort you to the cave. Our Lord will unfold His mercy to you, and will dispose for you your affair advantageously
18|17|And you might have seen the sun, when it rose, decline from their cave towards the right hand, and when it set leave them on the left hand, while they were in the spacious part thereof. That is one of the Signs of Allah. Whom Allah guides he is guided ind
18|18|You would have deemed them waking though they were asleep, as We turned them towards the right and towards the left; and their dog spreading out his fore-paws on the threshold. Had you come suddenly upon them you would surely have turned and fled away fr
18|19|Thus did We raise them up that they might question each other. A speaker from amongst them said, "How long have you tarried?" They said, "We have tarried perhaps a day or part of a day." Others said, "Allah knows best how long you
18|20|For should they perceive you, they would stone you, or would force you back again unto their faith, and you would never prosper (or succeed)
18|21|Thus did We make their people acquainted with their story, that they might know that Allah´s promise is true; and that the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When they (the people of the city) disputed amongst themselves concerning their affair
18|22|Some say, "They were three, and the fourth of them was their dog:" and some say, "Five, and the sixth of them was their dog:" guessing at the unseen: and some say, "Seven, and the eighth of them was their dog." Say, "My
18|23|And never say of anything, "Verily, I am going to do that to-morrow
18|24|Except (by adding) "If Allah please;" and remember your Lord when you have forgotten, and say, "It may be that my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to the right way
18|25|So they stayed in their cave three hundred years and (some add) nine more
18|26|Say, "Allah knows best how long they stayed. His are the unseen things of the heavens and the earth. How clear of Sight is He, and how keen of Hearing!" They have no patron beside Him, nor does He let any one share in His Sovereignty (or Command)
18|27|So, recite that which has been revealed (or inspired) unto you of the Book from your Lord. There is no changing (or none can change) His words; nor shall you ever find a refuge beside Him
18|28|Restrain thyself with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, desiring His countenance (or nearness and intimacy), and let not your eyes be turned from them, desiring the adornment (and pomp) of the life of this world; and obey not him whose h
18|29|But say, "The truth is from your Lord, so let him who will, believe; and let him who will, disbelieve." Verily, We have prepared for the evildoers a Fire, sheets of which shall encompass them; and if they cry for help, they shall be helped with
18|30|Verily, those who believe and act righteously - verily, We suffer not the reward of him whose work is goodly to be wasted
18|31|For such are gardens of Eden; beneath them rivers flow; they shall be adorned therein with bracelets of gold, and shall wear green robes of finest silk, and of gold brocade; reclining therein on thrones - blessed is the reward, and goodly the couch
18|32|Strike out for them a Similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We have assigned two gardens of grapes, and surrounded them both with date-palms, and put corn-fields (or tilled fields) between the two
18|33|Each of the two gardens brought forth its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We caused a river to gush forth therein
18|34|And he had abundant fruit, and he said unto his neighbour (or companion) in the course of mutual discussion (or argument), "I am much wealthier than you, and mightier in men (with more honour and power)
18|35|And he went in unto his garden, having thus wronged himself: said he, "I do not think that all this will ever perish
18|36|And I think not that the Hour (of Judgment) will ever come; and even if I be sent back unto my Lord, I shall surely find something even better in exchange
18|37|His neighbour, while he disputed with him, exclaimed, "Disbelieve you in Him who created you from dust, and then from a drop, then fashioned you into a man
18|38|But He is Allah, my Lord; and I associate no partner with my Lord
18|39|Why could you not have said when you did enter into your garden, ´As Allah pleases! (Or It is Allah´s will or Allah´s will always comes to pass). There is no power save in Allah!´. Though you see me as less than you in wealth
18|40|It may be that my Lord will give me something better than your garden, and will send upon it a bolt from heaven, and it shall be but bare slippery mud on the morrow
18|41|Or some morning the water thereof will be deeply sunk in the earth so that you can not get thereat
18|42|And his fruits were beset (with ruin). Then began he to wring his hands for all that he had spent thereon, for now it had crumbled down to its foundations. And he said, "Would that I had ascribed no partner with my Lord
18|43|And he had no troop of men to help him against Allah, nor could he save himself
18|44|In such a case the patronage is Allah´s alone, the True; He is best at rewarding and best for consequences (or success)
18|45|Strike out for them, also, a similitude of the life of this world; like water, which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth absorbs it; but on the morrow (or soon) it is dried up, and the winds scatter it; for Allah is powerful over al
18|46|Wealth and children are an ornament of the life of this world; but good works which endure are better with your Lord, for recompense, and better for hope
18|47|And (think about) the Day when We will remove the mountains, and you shall see the whole earth emerging (or laid level); and We will gather them all, leaving out none
18|48|Then shall they be presented to your Lord in ranks - Now have you come to Us (bare) as We created you at first! Aye, but you thought that We would never fulfil Our appointment (with you)
18|49|And the Book (of Deeds) shall be placed, and you shall see the sinners in fear of what is recorded therein; and they will say, "Alas, for us! What a Book is this, it leaves out neither small nor great things, without numbering them?" And they sh
18|50|And (remember) when We said to the angels, "Fall prostrate in obeisance before Adam," they fell prostrate in obeisance, save only Iblis, who was of the Jinn, and who revolted against the command of his Lord. What! Will you then take him and his
18|51|I made them not witnesses of the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor of the creation of themselves, nor did I take for My helpers those who lead astray
18|52|(Be mindful) Of the day when He shall say, "Call you upon My pretend partners" and they shall call on them, but they shall not answer them; and We will set the vale of perdition between them
18|53|And the guilty shall see the Fire, and shall know that they are about to fall therein, and shall find no escape there from
18|54|Verily, We have displayed in this Quran for men all kinds of similitudes (parables); but man is ever contentious
18|55|Naught prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, or from asking pardon of their Lord, except the coming on them of the judgment of the people of olden days, or the coming of the doom before their own eyes
18|56|We sent not prophets save as heralds of glad tidings and as Warners; but those who disbelieve wrangle with vain speech to make void the truth therewith; and they take My revelations and warnings as a jest
18|57|Who is more unjust than he who, being reminded of the revelations of his Lord, turns away there from, and forgets what his hands have sent forward? Verily, We have placed veils upon their heart lest they should understand, and deafness in their ears! And
18|58|But your Lord is Forgiving, endowed with Mercy; were He to punish them for what they have earned He would have hastened for them the doom. Nay rather, they have their appointed term from which they have no escape
18|59|Such were the populations; We destroyed them when they were unjust (iniquitous); and for their destruction We set an appointed time
18|60|And when Moses said to his servant, "I will not cease until I reach the confluence of the two seas, though I go on for years
18|61|But when they reached the confluence of the two they forgot their Fish, and it took its way in the sea with a free course
18|62|And when they had gone further, he said to his servant, "Bring us our breakfast, for we have suffered much fatigue on this journey
18|63|Said he, "What think you? When we resorted to the rock, then, verily, I forgot the fish, but it was only Satan, who made me forget it, and I forgot to tell you; and it took its way in the sea in a marvellous way
18|64|Moses said, "This is what we were searching for." So they retraced their steps again
18|65|Then they found a servant of Ours, to whom We had given mercy from Ourselves, and had taught him knowledge from Our Presence
18|66|Said Moses to him, "May I follow you, so that you may teach me of the (Higher) Truth which you have been taught
18|67|Said he, "Verily, you can never bear it
18|68|How can you be patient about what you can compass no knowledge (you cannot understand)
18|69|He said, "Allah willing, you will find me patient; nor will I rebel against your bidding
18|70|He said, "Well then, if you follow me, ask me not about anything until I myself begin to mention it
18|71|So they set out until when they were in the boat, he made a hole therein and scuttled it. (Moses) Said, "Have you made a hole therein to drown the people therein? You have done a dreadful thing
18|72|Said he, "Did I not tell you, truly, you can never bear with me
18|73|Moses said (pleaded), "Rebuke me not for forgetting, and be not hard on me
18|74|So they set out until they met a boy, and he killed him. Moses said, "What! Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed no one? Verily, you have done a foul (evil) deed
18|75|He answered, "Did I not tell you, truly, you can not bear with me
18|76|Said Moses, "If ever I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company. Now have you received a promise from me
18|77|So they set out until when they came to the people of a city; and they asked the people thereof for food; but they refused to entertain them. And they found therein a wall which was about to fall into ruins, and he repaired it. Said Moses, "Had you p
18|78|Said he, "This is the parting between me and you. I will give you the interpretation of that with which you could not bear with me
18|79|As for the boat, it belonged to poor people, who toiled on the sea (or river), and I wished to damage it, for behind it was a king who seized on every boat by force
18|80|And as for the youth, his parents were believers, and we feared lest he should oppress them with rebellion and disbelief
18|81|So we desired that their Lord would give them in exchange a better one than him in purity, and nearer in filial affection
18|82|And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan youths in the city, and beneath it was a treasure belonging to them both, and their father was a righteous man, and their Lord desired that they should reach maturity, and then take out their treasure as a me
18|83|And they will ask you about Zul´qarneyn (The Two-horned one, perhaps an ancient Persian Emperor). Say, "I will recite to you a remembrance of him
18|84|Verily, We established him firmly in the land, and We gave him a way to everything
18|85|And he followed a way
18|86|Until when he reached the setting of the sun (furthest West), he found it setting in a black muddy spring and he found thereat a people. We said, "O Zul´qarneyn! You have authority either to torment these people, or treat them kindly
18|87|Said he, "As for him who does wrong, I will punish him, then shall he be sent back to his Lord, and He will punish him with an unheard-of torment
18|88|But as for him who believes and acts aright, for him is an excellent reward, and we will give him our easy command
18|89|Then he followed another way
18|90|Until when he reached the rising of the sun (furthest East), he found it rising upon a people to whom We had given no shelter there from
18|91|He left them as they were. And We comprehended fully the forces before him
18|92|Then he followed still another way
18|93|Until when he reached the point between the two mountains, he found below them a people who could scarcely under-stand speech
18|94|They said, "O Zul´qarneyn! Verily, Yagug and Magug (Gog and Magog) are doing great evil in the land. Shall we then pay you tribute, that you set between us and them a barrier
18|95|He said, "The power my Lord hath established me in is better than tribute; help me, therefore, with strength (labour), and I will set a barrier between you and them
18|96|Bring me blocks of iron. When they had filled up the space between the two mountain-sides, he said, "Blow (with your bellows)". When he had made it red with fire, he said, "Bring me, that I may pour over it, molten lead
18|97|Thus were they made powerless to scale it, and to tunnel through it
18|98|Said he, "This is a mercy from my Lord; but when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it as dust, for the promise of my Lord is true
18|99|And on that Day We shall leave them to surge like waves over one another; and the trumpet will be blown, and We will gather them all together
18|100|And We will set forth Hell on that day before the disbelievers
18|101|Whose eyes were veiled from My Remembrance, and who were unable to hear
18|102|What! Did those who disbelieve reckon that they could take My servants for patrons beside Me? Verily, We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers for their entertainment
18|103|Say, "Shall we inform you of those who lose most by their works
18|104|Those who erred in their endeavours in the life of this world, and who thought they were acquiring good by their deeds
18|105|They are those who disbelieve in the signs of their Lord and in their meeting Him; vain are their works; and We will not give them any weight on the Day of Judgment
18|106|That is their reward - Hell! Because that they disbelieved and took My revelations and My Messengers as a jest
18|107|Verily, those who believe and act righteously, for them are Gardens of Paradise
18|108|Wherein they shall dwell, and they shall crave no change there from
18|109|Say, "Were the oceans ink for the Words of my Lord, the ocean would surely fail before the Words of my Lord fail; aye, though We brought as much ink again
18|110|Say, "I am only a mortal like yourselves; I am inspired that your God is only one God. Then let him who hopes to meet his Lord work righteous acts, and join none with Him in the service of his Lord

19|2|A mention of your Lord´s mercy to His servant Zachariah
19|3|When he called on his Lord in secret

19|5|But I fear my kinsfolk after me, since my wife is barren; then grant me from Thy presence a successor
19|6|To be my heir (or true representative) and the heir (or true representative) of the family of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, one with whom you are well-pleased
19|7|(The answer came), "O Zachariah! Verily, We give you glad tidings of a son, whose name shall be John. None by that name have We distinguished before
19|8|Said he, "My Lord! How can I have a son, when my wife is barren, and I have become decrepit through old age
19|9|He said, "Thus it will be. Your Lord says, ´It is easy for Me, for I created you at first when yet you were nothing.´
19|10|Said he, "O my Lord! Give me a sign." He said, "Your sign is that you shall not speak to any man for three nights, though you are sound
19|11|Then he went forth unto his people from the chamber, and he made signs to them, "Glorify your Lord at break of day and fall of night
19|12|(And it was said to his son) " O John! Hold fast the Book", and We gave him Wisdom even as a boy
19|13|And compassion from Our Presence, and purity; and he was devout (pious, righteous)
19|14|And kind to his parents, and was not arrogant and rebellious
19|15|So peace upon him the day he was born, and the day he died, and the day he shall be raised up to life again
19|16|And mention Mary in the Book; when she retired from her family into an eastern chamber
19|17|And she took a veil (to screen herself) from them; and We sent unto her Our Angel (or spirit); and he assumed for her the semblance of a perfect man
19|18|Said she, "Verily, I take refuge in the Merciful One from you, if you are god-fearing
19|19|Said he, "I am only a messenger of your Lord to bestow on you a pure son
19|20|Said she, "How can I have a boy when no mortal has touched me, and when I am no harlot
19|21|He said, "Thus says your Lord, ´It is easy for Me! And We will make him a revelation unto mankind, and a mercy from Us; for it is a thing ordained (or decreed)
19|22|So she conceived him, and she retired with him into a remote place
19|23|And the labour pains came upon her at the trunk of a palm tree, and she said, "O that I had died before this, and become a thing of naught, forgotten
19|24|Then one called to her from beneath her "Grieve not, for your Lord has placed a stream beneath your feet
19|25|And shake towards you the trunk of the palm tree, it will drop upon you fresh ripe dates
19|26|So eat, and drink, and be consoled; and if you should see any mortal say, "Verily, I have vowed to the Beneficent One a fast, and I will not speak to-day to any mortal
19|27|Then she brought him (her son) to her people, carrying it. Said they, "O Mary! You have done an amazing (abominable) thing
19|28|O sister of Aaron! Your father was not a bad man, nor was your mother a harlot
19|29|Then she pointed to him, and they said, "How are we to speak with one who is a baby in the cradle
19|30|He (the baby) said, "Verily, I am a servant of Allah; He has brought me the Book (revelation), and He has made me a prophet
19|31|And He has made me blessed wherever I am; and He has required of me prayer and charity as long as I live
19|32|And has made me kind towards my mother, and not arrogant (tyrannical) and miserable
19|33|And peace upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised up alive
19|34|Such was Jesus, the son of Mary. This is the statement of truth concerning which they doubt (or dispute)
19|35|It befits not the Majesty of Allah that he should beget a son. Glory be to Him! When He decrees a matter He only says to it, "BE," and it is
19|36|And, lo! Allah is my Lord and your Lord (see John 20:17), so worship Him; this is the Straight Way
19|37|And the sects among them disagree, but woe to those who disbelieve from the meeting of the mighty Day
19|38|How plainly will they see and hear on the day when they shall come to Us; but today the evildoers are in manifest error
19|39|And warn them of the Day of Sighs (Anguish, Regret, Distress) when the matter is determined. Now they are heedless, and believe not
19|40|Verily, We will inherit the earth and all who are upon it, and unto Us shall they return
19|41|And mention Abraham in the Book; verily, he was a saint (a man of truth, a true witness), a prophet
19|42|When he said to his father, "O my sire! Why do you worship what can neither hear nor see nor avail you aught
19|43|O my Sire! Verily, to me has come knowledge which has not come to you; so follow me, and I will guide you to a Straight and Level Way
19|44|O my Sire! Serve not Satan; verily, Satan is ever a rebel against the Beneficent One
19|45|O my Sire! Verily, I fear that there may afflict you punishment from the Beneficent One, and that you may be a comrade (or client) of Satan
19|46|Said he, "What! Do you reject (or hate) my gods, O Abraham? Verily, if you do not desist I will certainly stone you; but get you gone from me for a long time
19|47|Said he, "Peace be upon you! I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Verily, He is to me most gracious
19|48|I will part from you and what you call on beside Allah, and will pray unto my Lord. It may be that in my prayer unto my Lord, I shall not be unblest
19|49|And when he had parted from them and what they served beside Allah, We granted him Isaac and Jacob, and each of them We made a prophet
19|50|And We bestowed on them of Our Mercy, and We granted them lofty honour on (or from) the tongue of truth
19|51|And mention Moses in the Book; verily, he was chosen, and was a Messenger, a prophet
19|52|We called him from the right side of the Mount (Sinai); and We made him draw nigh unto Us to commune with him
19|53|And We granted him out of Our Mercy, his brother Aaron also a prophet
19|54|And mention Ishmael in the Book; verily, he was true to his promise, and was a messenger and a prophet
19|55|He used to enjoin on his people prayers and charity, and was most acceptable (sacrifice) in the sight of his Lord
19|56|And mention, in the Book, Idris (Enoch?); verily, he was a saint and a prophet
19|57|And We raised him to a lofty place
19|58|These are those to whom Allah has been gracious, of the prophets of the seed of Adam, and of those whom We carried with Noah, and of the seed of Abraham and Israel, and of those We guided and elected. When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited un
19|59|But there succeeded after them a later generation who have ruined worship and have followed lusts (prejudices, fantasies, greed, self-interest, superstition), but they shall at length face deception (or failure, destruction)
19|60|Save such as repent and believe and act right; for these shall enter the Garden and shall not be wronged in aught
19|61|Gardens of Eden, which the Beneficent has promised to His servants in the Unseen; verily, His promise ever comes to pass
19|62|They shall hear no empty (vain) talk therein, but only Peace; and there they shall have their provision morning and evening
19|63|Such is the Garden which We will give for an inheritance to those of our servants who are devout
19|64|(The angels say), "We descend not save at the command of your Lord; His is what is before us, and what is behind us, and what is between these; for your Lord is never forgetful
19|65|The Lord of the heavens and the earth, and of what is between the two; so serve (worship) Him and persevere in His service. Do you know of any worthy of His Name
19|66|Man will say, "What! When I have died shall I then come forth alive
19|67|But then does not man remember that We created him before when he was naught
19|68|And by your Lord! We will, without doubt, gather them together, and the devils (or evil ones) too; then will We surely bring them forth on their knees round about Hell
19|69|Then shall We certainly drag, out from every sect, whichever of them has been most obstinately rebellious against the Beneficent
19|70|And surely We are best aware of those who are most deserving to be broiled therein
19|71|There is not one of you who will not go down to it (the Fire), that is a fixed Decree of your Lord
19|72|Then We will save those who fear Us; but We will leave the evildoers therein on their knees
19|73|And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Which of the two parties (your s or mine) is best placed and in the best company
19|74|And how many generations before them have We destroyed who were better off in property and outward appearance
19|75|Say, "Whoever is in error, the Beneficent will extend to him until they see what they are threatened with, whether it be the torment in this world or whether it be the Hour (of Doom in the Hereafter), then they shall know who is worse placed and weak
19|76|And those who seek guidance, Allah will increase their guidance. And enduring good works are best with your Lord for a reward, and best for restoration (or eventual returns)
19|77|Have you seen him who disbelieves in Our signs, and says, "I shall surely be given wealth and children
19|78|Has he become acquainted with the Unseen, or has he made a pact with the Beneficent
19|79|Not so! We will write down what he says, and We will extend for him a span of torment
19|80|And We will make him inherit that whereof he spoke, and he shall come to Us alone
19|81|They take other gods besides Allah to be their source of power
19|82|Not so! They shall deny their worship of them, and shall become their opponents
19|83|Do you not see that We have sent the devils against the disbelievers, to confound them with confusion
19|84|So be not you hasty with them. Verily, We do but number them a sum (of days)
19|85|On the Day when We will gather the righteous unto the Beneficent, honoured as a goodly company
19|86|We will drive the guilty into hell, like thirsty herds to water
19|87|They shall have no power of intercession, save him who has taken a covenant with his Lord
19|88|They say, "The Beneficent has taken to Himself a son
19|89|Assuredly, you have brought a monstrous thing
19|90|Whereby the heavens are almost torn asunder, and the earth is riven, and the mountains fall in ruin
19|91|That you attribute to the Beneficent a son
19|92|When it is not becoming to the majesty of the Beneficent that he take to Himself a son
19|93|There is none in the heavens or the earth but comes to the Beneficent as a servant
19|94|Verily, He knows them and numbers them exactly
19|95|And each one of them come unto Him on the Day of Resurrection, alone
19|96|Verily, those who believe and act aright, on them the Beneficent bestows love
19|97|We have made the Scripture easy on your tongue, only that you may thereby give glad tidings unto those who ward of evil, and warn thereby a contentious people
19|98|How many a generation before them have We destroyed? Can you find any one of them, or hear a whisper of them
20|1|TA HA
20|2|We have not sent down this Quran to you that you should be distressed
20|3|But only as a reminder to him who fears (or is in awe of Allah or fears doing wrong)
20|4|Descending (as a revelation) from Him who created the earth and the high heavens
20|5|The most Beneficent is firmly settled on the Throne (of Authority)
20|6|To Him belongs what is in the heavens, and what is in the earth, and all that which is between the two, and all that which is beneath the ground
20|7|And if you pronounce the words loudly (or publicly), yet, verily, he knows the secret and the even more hidden
20|8|Allah! There is no God but He! To Him belong the Most Beautiful Names
20|9|Has the story of Moses come to you
20|10|Behold, he saw a fire: and said to his folk, "Tarry ye; verily, I perceive a fire far off. Perhaps I may bring you there from a brand, or may find some guidance (news, information) by the fire
20|11|And when he came to it he was addressed, "O Moses
20|12|Verily, I am your Lord, so take off your sandals; verily, you are in the holy valley Tuwa
20|13|And I have chosen you. So listen to what is inspired in you
20|14|Verily, I am Allah; there is no God but Me! So serve Me, and be steadfast in prayer to remember Me
20|15|Verily, the hour is coming, but I will to keep it hidden (but make it known), that every soul may be recompensed for its efforts
20|16|Let not then him who believes not therein and follows his lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions) ever turn you away there from, lest you be ruined
20|17|What is that in your right hand, O Moses
20|18|Said he, "It is my staff on which I lean, and wherewith I beat down leaves for my flocks, and for which I have other uses
20|19|Allah said, "Throw it down, O Moses
20|20|And he threw it down, and behold! It was a snake, moving (alive)
20|21|He said, "Take hold of it and fear not; We will restore it to its former state
20|22|But press your hand to your side, it shall come forth white without harm, as another sign
20|23|To show you of Our greater signs
20|24|Go unto Pharaoh. Verily, he is outrageous (he has transgressed beyond bounds)
20|25|Said he, "My Lord! Expand for me my breast (relieve my mind from tension)
20|26|And ease my task for me
20|27|And loosen the knot from my tongue
20|28|That they may understand my saying
20|29|Appoint for me a minister from my people
20|30|Aaron, my brother
20|31|Gird up my loins through him
20|32|And let him share my task
20|33|That we may glorify Thee much
20|34|And much remember Thee
20|35|Verily, Thou art He who is ever Seeing of us
20|36|He said, "You are granted your request, O Moses
20|37|And We have already shown favours unto you at another time
20|38|When We inspired your mother with the message
20|39|´Put him into the ark, and put it into the river. The river shall cast him on the shore, and an enemy of Mine and of his shall take him.´ And on you have I cast love from Me, that you may be trained according to My will
20|40|When your sister walked on and said, "Shall I guide you to one who will nurse him? And We restored you to your mother, that her eye might be cheered and that she should not grieve. And you did slay a man and We saved you from the resulting trouble, a
20|41|And I have prepared you for Myself
20|42|Go, you and your brother, with my Signs (revelations), and be not remiss in remembering Me
20|43|Go you both to Pharaoh. Verily, he is outrageous (transgresses beyond bounds)
20|44|And speak to him a gentle speech, that per chance (or possibly) he may be mindful or fear
20|45|They two said, "Our Lord! Verily, we fear that he may be beforehand with us (hasty in arrogance before we can accomplish our mission), or that he may be outrageous (transgressing all bounds or tyrannous)
20|46|He said, "Fear not. Verily, I am with you twain, Hearing and Seeing
20|47|So go you to him and say, ´Verily, we are the messengers of your Lord; Let the children of Israel go with us, and torment them not. We bring you a sign from your Lord, and peace will be upon him who follows the right guidance
20|48|´Verily, it has been revealed unto us that the torment will surely come upon him who denies us and turns away.´
20|49|Pharaoh said, "And who is your Lord, O Moses
20|50|He said, "Our Lord is He who gave everything its form, nature and existence, then guided it right
20|51|Said he (Pharaoh), "And what of the former generations
20|52|He said, "The knowledge of them is with my Lord in a Book (or Record); my Lord neither errs nor forgets
20|53|Who made for you the earth a bed; and has traced for you paths therein; and has sent down from the sky water." We have brought forth thereby divers classes of vegetation
20|54|Eat and pasture your cattle there from. Verily, in this are signs to those endowed with intelligence (minds or understanding)
20|55|From it have We created you and into it will We return you, and from it will We bring you forth again
20|56|We did show him Our signs, all of them, but he called them lies and refused
20|57|Said he, "Have you come to us, to turn us out of our land with your magic, O Moses
20|58|Then we will bring you magic like it; and we will make between us and you an appointment which we shall not fail to keep - neither we nor you - at a fair place (convenient to both or one where both have an equal chance)
20|59|Moses said, "Let your appointment be for the day of the festival, and let the people assemble when the sun is high (noon)
20|60|Then Pharaoh gathered his strength (being disconcerted), and returned (having formed a plot)
20|61|Said Moses to him, "Woe to you! Forge you not against Allah a lie; lest He destroy you by punishment. The forger must ever suffer disappointment (or failure)
20|62|And they argued the matter among themselves, but they kept their counsel secret
20|63|Said they, "These two are certainly two expert magicians, who wish to turn you out of (authority in) the land by their magic, and to remove your most cherished (or exemplary) traditions (doctrines, institutions)
20|64|Collect, therefore, your tricks (or lay your plans), and then form a row (or battle line); for he who has the upper-hand this day will be successful indeed
20|65|Said they, "O Moses! Either you must throw first, or let us throw first
20|66|He said, "Nay, you throw first!" And lo! Their ropes and their staves appeared to move along
20|67|And Moses felt a secret fear within his soul
20|68|Said We, "Fear not! You shall have the upper hand
20|69|Throw what is in your right hand; and it shall devour what they have made. Verily, that which they have made is but a magician´s trick; and no magician shall prosper whatever skill he has
20|70|And then the magicians were cast down in prostration (obeisance), saying, "We believe in the Lord of Aaron and of Moses
20|71|Said he (Pharaoh), "Do you believe in Him before I give you leave? Verily, he is your master who taught you magic! Therefore will I surely cut off your hands and feet on alternate sides, and I will surely crucify you on the trunks of palm trees; and
20|72|Said they, "We will never prefer you to what has come to us as Manifest Signs, and to Him who originated us. Decree then whatever you desire to decree; for you can only decree about the life of this world
20|73|Verily, we believe in our Lord. May He pardon us our sins, and the magic you have forced us to use; and Allah is better and more lasting
20|74|Verily, he who comes to his Lord guilty, verily, for him is hell; he shall therein neither die nor live
20|75|But he who comes to Him a believer who has done right, for them are the highest ranks
20|76|Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for ever. That is the reward for him who grows (or purifies himself)
20|77|And We inspired Moses, saying, "Journey by night with my servants, and strike out for them a dry road in the sea. Fear not pursuit, nor be afraid
20|78|Then Pharaoh followed them with his armies, and the sea overwhelmed them and covered them up completely
20|79|Pharaoh had led his people astray instead of guiding them right
20|80|O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy; and We made a covenant with you on the side of the mount; and We sent down upon you the manna and the quails
20|81|Saying, "Eat of the good things We have provided you with, but do not commit excesses therein, lest My wrath justly descend upon you; for on whomsoever My wrath descends they perish indeed
20|82|Yet am I also He who forgives unto him who repents and believes and does right, and then is guided
20|83|But what has hastened you on away from your people, O Moses
20|84|Moses said, "They are here close behind, and I hastened to Thee, my Lord, to please Thee
20|85|Said He, "Verily, We have tested your people in your absence, and As-Samiri has led them astray
20|86|And Moses returned to his people, wrathful, grieving! Said he, "O my people! Did not your Lord make you a goodly promise? Has the time seemed too long for you, or do you desire that wrath should descend on you from your Lord, and so you have broken y
20|87|They said, "We have not broken our promise to you of our own accord. But we were made to carry the load of the ornaments of the people, and we hurled them (into the fire). That was what As-Samiri bid us
20|88|Then he brought forth for the people (out of the fire) a corporeal (a statue of a) calf. It seemed to low, and they said, "This is your god and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten
20|89|What! Do they not see that it does not answer them in speech, and cannot control for them harm or profit
20|90|Aaron had already, before this, said to them, "O my people! You are only being tried (or seduced) thereby; and, verily, your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me and obey my bidding
20|91|They said, "We will not cease to pay devotion to it until Moses return to us
20|92|Said he (Moses), "O Aaron! What prevented you, when you did see them go astray
20|93|From following me? Have you then rebelled against my bidding
20|94|Said he, "O son of my mother! Seize me not by my beard, or my head! Verily, I feared lest you should say, ´You have made a division amongst the children of Israel, and have not waited for my word.´
20|95|(Moses) said, "What was your design, O Samiri
20|96|Said he, "I beheld what they beheld not, and I grasped a handful of dust from the footprint of the messenger and cast it; for thus my soul induced me
20|97|Said he, "Then get you gone; verily, it shall be yours in life to say, "Touch me not!" and, verily, for you there is a tryst which you shall surely never break. But look at your god to which you were just now a devout worshipper. We will su
20|98|Your God is only Allah besides Whom there is no other God. He embraces all things in His knowledge
20|99|Thus do We narrate to you the history of what has gone before, and We have brought you from Our Presence a reminder
20|100|Whoever turns there from, verily, he shall bear a great burden on the Day of Resurrection
20|101|Abiding under it, an evil burden to bear on the Day of Resurrection
20|102|On the day when the Trumpet shall be blown, and We will gather the guilty on that day white-eyed (with terror)
20|103|They shall whisper to each other, "You have only tarried ten days
20|104|We know best what they say, when their leaders, best in conduct say, "You have only tarried a day
20|105|They will ask you about the mountains; say, "My Lord will break them into scattered dust
20|106|And He will leave them a level plain
20|107|Wherein you will see no curve or ruggedness (crookedness or unevenness)
20|108|On that day they shall follow the Caller who deceives not; and the voices shall be hushed before the Beneficent, and you shall hear naught but a shuffling (or tramp of marching feet)
20|109|On that day shall no intercession be of any avail, save from such as the Beneficent permits, and who is acceptable to Him
20|110|He knows what is before them and what is behind them, but they comprehend not His knowledge
20|111|All faces shall be humbled before the Living, the Self-subsisting, Eternal; Hopeless will be indeed the man that carries iniquity on his back
20|112|But he who does righteous acts and has faith, he shall fear neither wrong nor diminution
20|113|Thus have We revealed it in an Arabic Lecture (Quran); and have displayed in it certain threats, that per chance (or possibly) they may fear evil, or it may cause them to take heed
20|114|Exalted then be Allah, the King, the Truth (or the True King)! Hasten not the Quran before its inspiration is completed for you; but say, "O Lord! increase me in knowledge
20|115|We did make a covenant with Adam of yore, but he forgot it, and We found no firm purpose in him
20|116|And when We said to the angels, "Prostrate yourselves before Adam," they prostrated themselves, save Iblis, who refused
20|117|And We said, "O Adam! Verily, this is a foe to you and to your wife; never then let him drive you twain forth from the garden or you will be wretched
20|118|Verily, you have not to be hungry there, nor naked
20|119|And, verily, you shall not thirst therein, nor suffer from the sun´s heat
20|120|But Satan whispered to him, saying. "O Adam! shall I guide you to the Tree of Immortality, and a kingdom that wastes not away
20|121|And they ate there from, and their shame became apparent to them; and they began to stitch upon themselves some leaves of the garden; and Adam rebelled against his Lord, and went astray
20|122|Then his Lord chose him, and relented towards him, and guided him
20|123|Said he, "Go down, you twain, there from altogether, some of you foes to the other. And if there should come to you from Me a guidance; then whoever follows My guidance shall neither err nor come to grief
20|124|But he who turns away from Remembrance of Me, verily, for him shall be a narrow life; and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection
20|125|He shall say, "My Lord! Wherefore have you gathered me blind when I used to see
20|126|He shall say, "Our revelations came to you, and you did forget them; In like manner are you forgotten this Day
20|127|Thus do We recompense him who is extravagant and believes not in the revelations of his Lord; and the doom of the hereafter is keener and more lasting
20|128|Is it not guidance for them to know how many generations We have destroyed before them, amidst whose dwelling-places they walk? Verily, in that are signs to men of thought (or intelligence)
20|129|But for the decree already passed from your Lord, and a term already fixed, the judgment would have come to them now
20|130|Therefore, bear patiently with what they say, and celebrate the praises of your Lord ere the rising of the sun, and ere its setting, and glorify Him at times in the night and at the two ends of the day, that you may find acceptance
20|131|And do not strain after what We have provided a few of them - the splendours of the life of this world, through which We test them; but the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting
20|132|Bid your people worship, and persevere in it; We do not ask you to provide, it is We Who will provide for you. But the sequel is for righteousness
20|133|They say, "Unless he brings us a sign from his Lord.....". What! Has there not come to them the proof of what was in the former scriptures
20|134|But had We destroyed them with doom before it, they would have said, "If only Thou had sent to us a messenger, that we might follow Thy signs before we were abased and put to shame
20|135|Say, "Each one has to wait, so wait you also! But in the end you shall know who it is that is on the straight and level path, and who it is that is guided right
21|1|Their reckoning draws nigh to men, yet in heedlessness they turn aside
21|2|No new reminder comes to them from their Lord, but they listen to it as in (or while they play (or as a jest)
21|3|Their heart trifling with it (or pre-occupied elsewhere). And those who do wrong discourse secretly, saying, "Is this man aught but a mortal like yourselves? Will you succumb to magic with open eyes
21|4|Say, "My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and the earth, He is Hearer and Knower
21|5|Nay!" they say, "Muddled dreams; nay! He has forged it; nay! He is a poet; but let him bring us a sign as those of yore were sent
21|6|Of those before them not one of the communities which We destroyed believed, how will these believe
21|7|Nor did We send before them any but men whom We inspired? Ask you the people of the Scriptures if you do not know
21|8|Nor did We give them bodies that ate no food, nor were they immortal
21|9|Yet We made Our promise to them good, and We saved them and whom We pleased; but We destroyed those who committed excesses
21|10|Now have We sent down to you a Book in which is a reminder for you; have you then no sense
21|11|How many a community that had done wrong have We shattered, and raised up after it another people
21|12|And when they perceived Our Might, behold, they tried to flee from it
21|13|Flee not away, but return to what you delighted in, and to your dwellings, that you may be questioned
21|14|Said they, "O woe is us! Verily, we were wrong-doers
21|15|And that ceased not to be their cry until We made them like mown down fields, extinct (or as smouldering ashes)
21|16|We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between the two in play
21|17|Had We wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in (or nearer) Our Presence, if We would do such a thing
21|18|Nay, We hurl the True against the False and it does break its head, and lo! It vanishes. But woe to you for what you attribute (to Allah)
21|19|Unto Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth, and those who dwell in His Presence are not too proud to serve Him, nor do they weary
21|20|They glorify Him by night and day without intermission
21|21|Or have they chosen gods from the earth who can raise the dead
21|22|Were there in both (heaven and earth) gods beside Allah, both would surely have been disordered. Glorified is Allah, the Lord of the Throne, above all they ascribe unto Him
21|23|He can not be questioned concerning what He does, but They shall be questioned
21|24|Have they chosen gods beside Him? Say, "Bring your proofs. This is the reminder (Message) of those who are with me (Muhammad), and of those who were before me." Nay, most of them know not the truth, so they turn away
21|25|We have not sent any messenger before you, but We inspired him that, "There is no god but Me, so serve you Me
21|26|And they say, "The Beneficent has taken a son; glorified be He! Nay, but they are honoured servants
21|27|They speak not until He speaks; and they act by His command (John)
21|28|He knows what is before them, and what is behind them, and they can not intercede except for him whom He accepts; and they shrink through awe of Him
21|29|And whoever of them should say, "Verily, I am God instead of (or besides) Him," such a one We recompense with hell; thus do We repay the wrong-doers
21|30|Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, and We parted them; and We made every living thing from water. Will they then not believe
21|31|And We placed on the earth firm mountains lest it should move with them, and He made therein open roads for paths, per chance (or possibly) they may be guided
21|32|And We made the heaven a guarded canopy; yet from our signs they turn aside
21|33|He it is who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon, they float each in their orbit
21|34|We appointed immortality for no mortal before you. What! If you die, will they live on forever
21|35|Every soul must taste of death. We will test you with evil and with good, as a trial; and unto Us will you be returned
21|36|And when those who disbelieve see you, they only take you for a jest, saying, "Is this he who mentions your gods?" Yet they blaspheme at the mention of the Beneficent
21|37|Man is made of haste. I will show you My signs; but do not ask Me to hasten
21|38|And they say, "When will this threat (come to pass), if you tell the truth
21|39|If those who disbelieve but knew the time when they will not be able to ward off the Fire from their faces and from their backs, and they will not be helped
21|40|Nay, it shall come on them unawares, and shall dumbfound them, and they shall not be able to repel it, nor shall they be reprieved
21|41|Prophets before you have been mocked at, but that whereat they jested encompassed those who mocked
21|42|Say, "Who guards you by night and by day from the Beneficent?" Nay, but they turn away from the mention of their Lord
21|43|Have they gods to defend them against Us? These cannot help themselves, nor can they be defended against Us
21|44|Nay, but We have granted enjoyment to these men and to their fathers until the period grew long for them. Do they not see that We come to the land and shorten its borders? Shall they then prevail
21|45|Say, "I only warn you by inspiration;" but the deaf hear not the call when they are warned
21|46|But if a breath of the Wrath of your Lord touches them, they will surely say, "O, woe is us! Verily, we were wrong-doers
21|47|We will place a just balance on the Day of Resurrection, and no soul shall be wronged in anything. Even though it is the weight of a grain of mustard seed, We will bring it; for We are sufficient as a reckoner
21|48|In the past We did give to Moses and Aaron the Criterion (or Discrimination), and a Light and a Reminder to those who fear (evil)
21|49|Those who fear their Lord in secret (in thought), and who dread the Hour (of Judgment)
21|50|This is a blessed Reminder which We have sent down (or revealed), will you then reject it
21|51|And We gave Abraham of old his Rectitude of conduct (or proper course, as distinct from Faith); for We were aware of him (his faith)
21|52|When he said to his father and to his people, "What are these images to which you pay devotion
21|53|Said they, "We found our fathers worshipping them
21|54|Said he, "Verily, both you and your fathers have been in obvious error
21|55|They said, "Do you come to us with the truth, or are you but of those who jest
21|56|He said, "Nay, but your Lord is Lord of the heavens and the earth, which He originated (created from nothing); and I am of those who testify unto this
21|57|And, by Allah! I have a plan for your idols after you have gone and turned your backs
21|58|So he broke them in pieces, all except their largest, that they might have recourse to it
21|59|Said they, "Who has done this to our gods? Surely, he is of the evil-doers
21|60|Others said, "We heard a youth mention them, he is called Abraham
21|61|Said they, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may bear witness
21|62|Said they, "Was it you who did this to our gods, O Abraham
21|63|Said he, "Nay, it was this largest of the idols. But ask them, if they can speak
21|64|Then they turned to themselves and said, "Surely, you are the ones in the wrong
21|65|Then were they confounded with shame and said, "You knew well that these cannot speak
21|66|Said he, "Will you then worship, beside Allah, that which cannot profit you at all, nor harm you
21|67|Fie upon you, and what you serve beside Allah! Have you then no sense
21|68|They cried, "Burn him, and stand by your gods, if you are going to do anything
21|69|We said, "O fire! Be you cool and a safety for Abraham
21|70|They desired to set a snare for him, but We made them the losers
21|71|And We brought him and Lot safely to the land (Aram or Syria) which We have blessed for all nations (or peoples)
21|72|And We bestowed upon him Isaac, and as an additional gift (a grandson), Jacob and each of them We made righteous
21|73|And We made them Leaders to guide men by Our command, and We sent inspiration to them to do good works, and to be steadfast in prayer, and to practice charity; and they were constant in their service of Us alone
21|74|And Lot, to him We gave judgment and knowledge, and We delivered him safely from the community which practiced abominations; truly, they were a people given to evil lewdness
21|75|And We brought him into Our Mercy; verily, he was of the righteous
21|76|And Noah, of old times, when he called We answered him and saved him and his people from the great affliction
21|77|And We helped him against the people who said Our signs were lies; verily, they were a bad people, therefore did We drown them all
21|78|And David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field, when some people´s sheep had strayed therein at night; and We were witness to their judgment
21|79|And We gave Solomon right understanding of matters (or cases). To each of them We gave judgment and knowledge; and it was by Our power that the hills and the birds celebrate Our praises with David. It was We who did it
21|80|And We taught him the art of making coats of mail for you, to shield you from each other´s violence; are you then grateful
21|81|And to Solomon We subjected the violent wind, to flow tamely at his bidding to the land which We have blessed - for We are aware of all things
21|82|And some devils (evil ones), who dived for him, and did other works beside, it was We who kept guard over them
21|83|And Job, when he cried to his Lord, saying, "Lo! Adversity has touched me, but you are the most Merciful of the merciful ones
21|84|And We answered him, and removed from him the distress that was upon him; and We restored to him his people, and doubled their number as a mercy from Us, and as a remembrance to those who serve Us
21|85|And (remember) Ishmael, and Idris (Enoch?), and Zul-Kifl (Ezekiel?), all men of constancy and patient
21|86|And We admitted them into Our Mercy; verily, they were among the righteous
21|87|And remember Zun-nun (the man of the Whale, Jonah), when he went away in wrath and thought that We had no power over him; but he cried out in the darkness, "There is no God but Thou, celebrated be Thy praise! Verily, I was of the wrong
21|88|And We answered him, and saved him from the distress. Thus do We deliver those who have faith
21|89|And (remember) Zachariah, when he cried unto his Lord, "O Lord! Leave me not without off-spring, though you are the best of inheritors
21|90|And We answered him, and bestowed upon him Yahya (John); and We made his wife right for him (cured her barrenness). Verily, they used to vie with one another in good works, and they called unto Us with longing and awe, and were humble (or submissive) befo
21|91|And (remember) her who guarded her chastity, and We breathed into her of Our Spirit, and We made her and her son a sign unto the worlds (or all peoples, or all creatures)
21|92|Verily, this your religion (or brotherhood) is a single religion (brotherhood); and I am your Lord, so serve Me
21|93|But they cut up their affairs (religion, politics etc. into fragments) amongst themselves, yet they all shall return unto Us
21|94|And he who acts right and he who is a believer (or has faith), there is no denial of his efforts, for, verily, We record it for him
21|95|There is a ban upon any community which We have destroyed that they shall not return
21|96|Until Yagug and Magug (Gog and Magog, Lawless tribes or Lawlessness itself) are let loose (through every barrier), and they hasten out of every mound (rock, nook and cranny)
21|97|And the True Promise draws nigh, and lo! They are staring, wide-eyed are those who disbelieve, saying, "O, woe is us! We were heedless of this, aye, we were wrong-doers
21|98|Verily, ye, and what you serve beside Allah, shall be the fuel of hell. Thereto shall you go down
21|99|Had these been gods, they would not have come hither, but all shall dwell therein
21|100|For them therein is groaning, and they shall not be heard
21|101|Verily, those for whom the Good from Us has gone before, they will be removed far there from
21|102|They shall not hear the slightest sound of Hell, and they will dwell in what their souls desire
21|103|The Great Terror shall not grieve them; but the angels shall greet them, saying, "This is your day, the one which you were promised
21|104|The Day when We will roll up the heavens as a recorder rolls up the scroll. As We produced it at its first creation, We shall repeat it - a promise binding upon Us; verily, We shall do it
21|105|And already have We written in the Psalms after the Reminder (the Message of Moses) that "My righteous servants shall inherit the earth
21|106|Verily, in this is a plain statement for a people who serve Me
21|107|We have sent you not, but as a mercy to the worlds
21|108|Say, "I am only inspired that your God is one God; will ye, then, surrender unto Him (become Muslims)
21|109|But if they turn their backs, then say, "I have proclaimed the message to you all alike, though I know not if what you are promised be near or far
21|110|Verily, He knows what is spoken openly, and that which you hide
21|111|I know not but that this may be a trial for you, and provision for a season
21|112|Say, "O My Lord! Judge you with truth! Our Lord is the Beneficent Whose aid is to be sought against the blasphemies you utter
22|1|O mankind! Fear your Lord. Verily, the convulsions of the Hour (of Judgment) will be a thing terrible
22|2|On the day you shall see it, every suckling woman shall be scared away from that to which she gave suck; and every pregnant woman shall drop her load unformed; and you shall see men in drunken riot, though not drunk: but dreadful will be the wrath of Alla
22|3|And yet amongst men are such who wrangles about Allah without knowledge, and follows every rebellious devil
22|4|Against whom it is written down that whoever turns to him for friendship, verily, He will lead him astray, and will guide him towards the penalty of the blaze
22|5|O Mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, consider that We created you from earth, then from a seed, then from a clot, then from a little lump of flesh, shaped or shapeless, that We may explain to you. And We make what We please to remain in
22|6|That is because Allah, He is the Truth. Lo! He quickens the dead, and lo! He is Able to do all things
22|7|And because the Hour will come; there is no doubt thereof; and because Allah will raise those who are in the graves
22|8|And yet amongst men are those who wrangles about Allah without knowledge, without guidance, and without a Book of Enlightenment
22|9|Turning his neck from the way of Allah; for him is disgrace in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection We will make him taste the doom of burning
22|10|This is for what your two hands have sent before you, and in this Allah is not an oppressor unto His servants
22|11|And amongst men are those who serve Allah wavering on a brink; so that if there befall him good, he is comforted; but if there befall him a trial, he falls away. He loses both this world and the Hereafter - that is an obvious loss
22|12|He calls, besides Allah, on what can neither harm him nor profit him - that is a wide error
22|13|He calls on him whose harm is nearer than his benefit - verily, an evil patron and an evil comrade
22|14|Verily, Allah makes those who believe and do aright enter into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; verily, Allah does what He intends
22|15|He who thinks that Allah will not help him (Muhammad) in this world or in the Hereafter, let him stretch a rope to the ceiling (or heaven) and put an end to himself; and then let him see if his plan will remove that which enrages him
22|16|Thus have We sent down Manifest Signs; for, verily, Allah guides whom He will
22|17|Verily, those who believe this Revelation, and those who are Jews, and the Sabaeans, and the Christians, and the Magians, and those who join other gods with Allah, verily, Allah will decide between them on the Day of Resurrection; verily, Allah is witness
22|18|Do you not see that unto Allah bow down in worship (or submit in service and adoration) whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and the beasts, and many among manki
22|19|These twain are two opponents who dispute about their Lord. But those who disbelieve, garments (or coverings) of fire will be cut out for them, and on their heads boiling water will be poured down
22|20|Whereby that which is in their bellies and their skins shall be scalded
22|21|And for them are hooks of iron
22|22|Whenever they desire to come forth there from through pain, they will be sent back into it: and (it is said unto them) "Taste you the penalty of the burning
22|23|Verily, Allah will make those who believe and do right enter into Gardens beneath which rivers flow; they shall be bedecked therein with bracelets of gold and with pearls, and their garments therein shall be of silk
22|24|For they are guided to goodly speech, and they shall be guided to the path of Him who is worthy of all praise (the All-laudable or Glorious One)
22|25|Verily, those who disbelieve and bar men from Allah´s path and from the Sacred Place of Worship, which We have appointed for all mankind alike, the dweller therein and the stranger - and he who desires therein profanity or injustice, We will make hi
22|26|And when We prepared the site (in Mecca) for Abraham as the place of the Holy House, saying, "Associate naught with Me, but cleanse My House for those who make the rounds, for those who stand to pray, for those who bow, and for those too who prostrat
22|27|And proclaim amongst men the Pilgrimage; they will come to you on foot and on every kind of camel, lean from journeys through distant mountain and deep ravines
22|28|That they may witness things of benefit for them, and that they may mention the name of Allah for (or on) appointed days over the cattle Allah has provided them with (for sacrifice), then eat thereof and feed the distressed ones in want
22|29|Then let them make an end of their self-neglect, and let them pay their vows and go around the ancient House
22|30|That do. And whoever magnifies the sacred things of Allah it is better for him with his Lord. Cattle are lawful for you, except that which has been recited to you. So shun the abomination of idols, and shun lying speech
22|31|Turning unto Allah only, not associating aught with Him; for he who associates aught with Allah, it is as though he had fallen from heaven, and the birds snatch him up, or the wind blows him away into a far distant place
22|32|That is his State. And he who honours the Symbols of Allah (and sacrificial animals), they come (or ought to come) from the piety of heart
22|33|Therein have you benefits for an appointed term. In the end the place for sacrificing them is near the Ancient House (Mina near the Kaaba)
22|34|To every nation have We appointed rites, that they may mention the name of Allah over the sustenance He has provided them from animals fit for food; and your God is one God; to Him then surrender, and give glad tidings to the humble
22|35|To those whose heart, when Allah is mentioned, are filled with awe, and to those who endure patiently all that befalls them, and to those who are steadfast in prayer and who spend of what We have given them
22|36|The camels! We have appointed them for you as one of the symbols of Allah. Therein have you much good; so mention the name of Allah over them as they stand in a row, and when they are down (dead after slaughter) eat of them, and feed the easily contented
22|37|Their meat will never reach to Allah, nor yet their blood, but the piety from you will reach Him. Thus hath He subjected them to you that you may magnify Allah for guiding you: and give you glad tidings to those who do right
22|38|Verily, Allah will defend those who are true; verily, Allah loves not any treacherous ingrate (or traitor and ingrate)
22|39|Permission is given to those who fight because they have been wronged, and, indeed, Allah has power to give them victory
22|40|Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said, "Our Lord is Allah;" - for were it not for Allah repelling some men by means of others, cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is
22|41|Those who, if We establish them in the land, are steadfast in prayer, and give regular charity, and bid what is right, and forbid what is wrong - with Allah rests the end (final outcome) of affairs
22|42|But if they call you liar, even so did the people of Noah, and the tribes of A´ad and Thamud, they denied (My messengers) before you
22|43|And the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot
22|44|And the dweller of Midian; and Moses was called a liar too: but I indulged the disbelievers a long while, and then I seized them, and how terrible was My rejection
22|45|And how many a city (community) have We destroyed while it was guilty (did wrong), and it tumbled down on its roof, lying ruined to this day, and how many a deserted well and lofty palace
22|46|Have they not travelled through the land? And have they not heart wherewith to feel (understand), and ears wherewith to hear? For, indeed, it is not their eyes that are blind, but it is the hearts which are within their breasts that grow blind
22|47|They will bid you to hasten on the torment, but Allah will never fail in his promise; for, verily, a day with your Lord is as a thousand years of what you number
22|48|And to how many a city have I given full range while it yet did wrong! Then I seized it, and unto Me was the return
22|49|Say, "O mankind! I am naught but a plain Warner to you
22|50|And to those who believe and do right, for them is forgiveness and a generous provision
22|51|But those who strive to discredit Our signs, they are rightful owners of the Fire
22|52|We have not sent before you any messenger or prophet, but that when he formed a desire (or recited the message), Satan introduced not something (evil or vain) into it; but Allah annuls what Satan proposes; then does Allah confirm (establish) His Signs (re)
22|53|That He may make that which Satan introduces a trial unto those in whose heart is a disease, and those whose heart are hardened - verily, the wrongdoers are in a wide schism
22|54|And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord, and may believe therein, and that their heart may surrender humbly unto Him. Verily, Allah surely will guide those who believe into the Straight Way
22|55|But those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the Hour (of Judgment) comes on them suddenly, or there comes on them the torment of the Day of Disaster
22|56|The dominion (or sovereignty) on that day shall be Allah´s, He shall judge between them; and those who believe and do aright shall be in Gardens of Delight
22|57|But those who disbelieve and deny Our revelation, for them is a shameful doom
22|58|And those who flee their homes in the cause of Allah, and then are slain or die, Allah will surely provide them with a goodly provision; for, verily, Allah is the best of providers
22|59|Assuredly, He shall make them enter by an entrance that they will love. For, verily, Allah is Knower, Most-forbearing
22|60|That is so. Whoever retaliates with the like of what He has been made to suffer, and shall then be wronged again, Allah shall surely succour him; verily, Allah blots out sins and is constantly Forgiving
22|61|That is because Allah causes the night to pass into day, and causes the day to pass into night, and because Allah is Hearer, Seer
22|62|That is because Allah, He is the Truth (or Reality), and that whereon they call instead of Him is the False, and because Allah, He is the High, the Great
22|63|See you not how Allah sends down water from the sky, and on the morrow the earth is green? Verily, Allah is Subtile, Aware
22|64|Unto Him belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth; verily, Allah is the Absolute, the Owner of all Praise
22|65|Have you not seen that Allah has subjected for you all that is in the earth, and the ship that runs on in the sea at His bidding, and He holds back the sky from falling on the earth save at His bidding? Verily, Allah to mankind is Gracious, Merciful
22|66|He it is who quickens you, then makes you die, then will He quicken you again; verily, man is indeed ungrateful
22|67|Unto every nation have We given sacred rites which they are to perform; so let them not then dispute about the matter, but summon you unto your Lord; verily, you (Muhammad) indeed follow right guidance
22|68|But if they wrangle with you, say, "Allah best knows what you do
22|69|Allah shall judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein you differ
22|70|Did you not know that Allah knows what is in the heavens and the earth? Verily, it is in a Record; verily, it is easy for Allah
22|71|And they serve beside Allah that for which He has sent down (revealed) no warrant, and that whereof they have no knowledge. For wrongdoers there is no helper
22|72|When Our clear revelations are read to them, you may recognize disdain in the faces of those who disbelieve; they well-nigh attack those who recite Our revelations to them. Say, "Shall I inform you of something worse than that for you? The Fire which
22|73|O mankind! A similitude is coined for you, so pay heed to it. Verily, those on whom you call beside Allah could never create a fly even if they combine together to do it. And if the fly should snatch something from them they could not rescue it from it. S
22|74|They do not value Allah at His true value; verily, Allah is Powerful, Mighty
22|75|Allah chooses from the angels messengers, and also from mankind; verily, Allah is Hearer and Seer
22|76|He knows what is before them and what is behind them; and unto Allah all things return
22|77|O you who believe! Bow down and prostrate yourselves (in obeisance), and serve your Lord, and do good, that per chance (or possibly) you may prosper
22|78|And strive in the cause of Allah, with the effort which is His due. He has chosen you, and has not laid upon you any hardship (or hindrance) in religion - the faith of your father Abraham. He has named you Muslims of old and in this (Scripture), that the
23|1|Successful indeed are the believers (or the believers will eventually win)
23|2|Who in their prayers are humble
23|3|And who shun vain talk
23|4|And who are constantly active in charitable works
23|5|And who abstain from sexual immodesty (or guard their modesty or chastity or sexual purity)
23|6|Except for with those joined with them in marriage or the captive whom their right hand possesses, for then, verily, they are free from blame
23|7|But whoever craves aught beyond that, they are the transgressors
23|8|And those who faithfully observe their trusts and covenants
23|9|And who guard well (pay heed to) their prayers
23|10|These will be the heirs
23|11|Who shall inherit Paradise; they shall dwell therein
23|12|We have created man from an extract of clay
23|13|Then We made him a drop (sperm) in a safe depository (the womb)
23|14|Then We made the drop into a clot, and We made the clot into a lump (foetus); then We made the lump into bone, and We clothed the bone with flesh; then We produced from it another creature. Blessed be Allah, the best of Creators
23|15|Then shall you after that surely die
23|16|Then, lo! On the Day of Resurrection shall you surely be raised
23|17|And We have created above you seven paths; and We are never heedless of creation
23|18|And We send down from the heaven water by measure, and We make it rest in the earth; but, verily, We are able to withdraw it
23|19|Then We produce for you thereby gardens of date-palms and grapes wherein you have much fruits, and whereof you eat
23|20|And a tree growing out of Mount Sinai (Olives) which produces oil, and a relish for eaters
23|21|And, verily, you have a lesson in the cattle; We give you to drink of what is in their bodies; and you have therein many uses, and of them you eat
23|22|And on them and on ships you are carried
23|23|We sent Noah unto his people, and he said, "O my people! Serve Allah, you have no God but Him; do you then not fear (evil)
23|24|Said the chiefs of those who disbelieved among his people, "This is nothing but a mortal like yourselves who wishes to make himself superior to you. Had Allah pleased He could surely have sent angels. We have not heard of this from our forefathers
23|25|He is nothing but a man possessed; so watch him for a while
23|26|Said he, "My Lord! Help me, for they deny me
23|27|And We inspired him, saying "Make the ark under Our eyes and Our inspiration; and when the oven (of Allah´s wrath) boils over (or the fountains or springs of the earth are about to gush forth), conduct into it of every kind two spouses, and you
23|28|But when you are settled, you and those with you in the ark, say, "Praise belongs to Allah, Who saved us from the unjust people
23|29|And say, ´My Lord! Cause me to land on a blessed landing place, for you are the best of all who bring to land.´
23|30|Verily, in this is a sign, and, verily, We are ever trying them (mankind)
23|31|Then We raised up after them another generation
23|32|And We sent amongst them a messenger of their own (or from among them), saying, "Serve Allah, you have no God but He; will you then not fear (evil)
23|33|Said the chiefs of the people who disbelieved, and denied the meeting in the Hereafter, and to whom We gave enjoyment in the life of this world, "This is only a mortal like yourselves, who eats of what you eat, and drinks of what you drink
23|34|If you obey a mortal like yourselves, verily, you will then be surely losers
23|35|Does he promise you that when you are dead, and have become dust and bones, that then you will be brought forth
23|36|Be gone, be gone, with that which you are promised (or it is far-fetched)
23|37|There is only our life in this world. We die and we live, and we shall not be raised again
23|38|He is only a man who invents a lie about Allah. And we believe him not
23|39|Said he, "My Lord! Help me, for they deny me
23|40|He said, "Within a little while they will surely be sorry
23|41|Then the blast seized them rightfully; and We made them as rubbish borne by a torrent (of Time); so, away with the wrong-doing people
23|42|Then after them We brought forth other generations
23|43|No nation (or people) can hasten its appointed term, nor delay it
23|44|Then We sent Our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came unto any nation they denied him; so We caused them to follow one another (to disaster); and We made them bywords. Away then with a people who believe not
23|45|Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs, and with plain authority
23|46|To Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they were inflated with pride, and were a despotic people
23|47|And they said, "Shall we believe two mortals like ourselves, and whose people are servile unto us
23|48|So they accused them of lying, and became of those who perished
23|49|And We verily gave Moses the Book, that per chance (or possibly) they might be guided
23|50|And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign; and We gave them both shelter on high, a place of security and springs
23|51|O you messengers! Eat of the good things and do right; verily, I am aware of what you do
23|52|And, verily, this your religion (or brotherhood) is one religion (or brotherhood), and I am your Lord; so keep your duty unto Me
23|53|But they (mankind) have broken their religion (or affair) between them into sects, each sect rejoicing in its own tenets
23|54|So leave them in their confused error (or ignorance) for a time
23|55|Think they that in the wealth and children, wherewith We provide them
23|56|We hasten unto them with good things? Nay, but they perceive not
23|57|Verily, those who walk in awe of their Lord
23|58|And those who believe in the revelations of their Lord
23|59|And those who ascribe not partners unto their Lord
23|60|And those who give what they give with heart afraid because they are about to return unto their Lord
23|61|These race to good things, and they shall be the first in the race
23|62|But We will not oblige a soul beyond its capacity; for with us is a Record that utters the truth, and they shall not be wronged
23|63|Nay, their heart are in ignorance of this, and they do deeds beside this which they continue to do
23|64|Until, when We catch the affluent ones amongst them with the punishment, then lo! They cry in supplication
23|65|Supplicate not this day! Assuredly, you will not be helped by (or against) Us
23|66|My revelations were recited to you, but you turned back upon your heels
23|67|In arrogant scorn thereof, raving vain nonsensical tales by night
23|68|Have they not pondered over the words, or has something new come unto them which came not to their forefathers
23|69|Or know they not their messenger that they thus deny him
23|70|Or do they say, "He is possessed"? Nay, but he came to them with the Truth, and most of them are haters of Truth
23|71|But if the truth were to conform to their desires, verily, the heavens and the earth and whoever is therein would be corrupted. Nay, We brought them their Reminder (The Quran), but from their Reminder they now turn away
23|72|Or do you ask them for a tribute? But the bounty of your Lord is better, for He is the best of those who provide
23|73|And, verily, you do call them to the Straight Way
23|74|But, verily, those who believe not in the Hereafter, they are indeed astray from that Way
23|75|But if We had mercy on them, and relieved their distress, they still would persist in their rebellion, blindly wandering on
23|76|And We caught them with the punishment, but they humble not themselves before their Lord, nor do they pray
23|77|Until, when We open for them the gate of extreme torment, then lo! They are plunged into despair
23|78|He it is who produced for you hearing and sight, and heart (or feelings, understanding, mind). Little thanks give you
23|79|And He it is Who has sown you broadcast in the earth, and unto Him shall you be gathered
23|80|And He it is Who gives you life and death; and His is the alternation of the night and the day; have you then no sense
23|81|Nay, but they say the like of that which those of yore did say
23|82|They said, "What! When we have become earth and bones, are we then going to be raised again
23|83|We were already promised this, we and our forefathers. Lo! this is naught but old folks´ tales
23|84|Say, "Whose is the earth and those who are therein, if you have knowledge
23|85|They will say, "Allah´s." Say, "Will you then not remember
23|86|Say, "Who is Lord of the seven heavens, and Lord of the Mighty Throne
23|87|They will say, "Allah." Say, "Will you then not keep your duty unto Him
23|88|Say, "In whose hand is the dominion over all things; He succours (or protects) but is not succoured (or needs no protection or against whom there is no protection), if you did but know
23|89|They will say, "Allah´s". Say, "How then can you be so deluded
23|90|Nay, We have brought them the Truth, but, verily, they are Liars
23|91|Allah never took a son, nor was there ever any God with Him; else would each God have assuredly gone off with (or championed, controlled) that which he had created, and some would assuredly have exalted themselves over (or overcome) others. Glorified be A
23|92|Knower of the invisible and the visible, exalted be He above what they associate with Him
23|93|Say, "My Lord! if you should show me what they are promised
23|94|My Lord! Then place me not amongst the wrong-doing people
23|95|And verily We are able to show you that which We have promised them
23|96|Repel evil by that which is best. We are best Aware of that which they allege
23|97|And say, "My Lord! I seek refuge in Thee from the suggestions of the devils
23|98|And I seek refuge in Thee from their presence
23|99|Until when death comes to any one of them he says, "My Lord! Send me back
23|100|That I may do right in that which I have left behind." Nay! It is but a mere word he speaks; behind them is a barrier until the Day they shall be raised
23|101|And when the trumpet shall be blown, and there shall be no kinship between them on that day, nor will they ask about each other then
23|102|And those whose scales are heavy (with good deeds), they are the successful
23|103|But those whose scales are light, these are they who lose their souls, in hell will they abide
23|104|The fire shall scorch their faces, and they shall curl their lips (in gloom) therein
23|105|(It will be said) "Were not My revelations recited to you? And did you not treat them as falsehoods
23|106|They will say, "Our Lord our misfortune overcame us, and we became a people astray
23|107|Our Lord! Take us out of this, and if we return to evil, then shall we be unjust indeed
23|108|He will say, "Be gone into it, and speak you not to Me
23|109|Verily, there was a sect of My servants who used to pray, "Our Lord! We believe, so forgive us, and have mercy upon us, for Thou art the best of the merciful ones
23|110|But you took them for a jest (treated them with ridicule) until you forgot My reminder and did laugh at them
23|111|Verily, I have rewarded them this day that they were steadfast; verily, they are indeed triumphant, blissful now
23|112|He will say, "How long a number of years did you tarry on earth
23|113|They will say, "We tarried but a day or part of a day, but ask those who keep count
23|114|He will say, "You have only tarried a little, if you but knew
23|115|Did you then think that We created you for jest (or sport, without purpose), and that you would not be returned to Us
23|116|But exalted be Allah, the True King; there is no God but He, the Lord of the Noble Throne (or Throne of Honour)
23|117|He who calls unto any other God along with Allah has no proof thereof; verily, his account is only with his Lord; verily, the disbelievers shall not be successful
23|118|And say, "Lord, Forgive and have mercy, for you are the best of the merciful ones
24|1|This is a chapter which We have revealed and ordained. In it We have revealed manifest signs in order that you may take heed
24|2|The man and the woman guilty of adultery (fornication, whoring), scourge each of them with a hundred stripes, and let not compassion for them withhold you from obedience to Allah, if you believe in Allah and the Last Day; and let a party of the believers
24|3|Let no adulterer marry any but an adulteress or an idolatress (or unbeliever), nor let any but such a man or an idolater (or unbeliever) marry such a woman. All this is forbidden to believers
24|4|And those who launch a charge (accusations, imputations) on chaste women, but bring not four witnesses, scourge them with eighty stripes, and never afterwards accept their testimony, for these are, indeed, evil-doers (workers of abomination)
24|5|Except such as repent after that and make amends, for, verily, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful
24|6|And those who cast charges (accusations, imputations) against their wives and have no witnesses except themselves, then the testimony of one of them shall be to testify four times that, by Allah, he is of those who speak the truth
24|7|And a fifth, to invoke the curse of Allah on him if he be of those who lie
24|8|And it shall avert the punishment from her if she bears testimony four times that, by Allah, he is of those who lie
24|9|And the fifth that the wrath of Allah shall be on her if he be of those who speak the truth
24|10|And were it not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy unto you, and that Allah is Relenting, Wise (he would have been ruined)
24|11|Verily, those who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not as an evil for you. Nay, it is good for you. Every man of them shall have what he has earned of sin; and he among them who had the greater share (took the lead), for him is an awful do
24|12|Why did not, when you heard it, the believers, men and women, think good of their own folk, and say, "This is an obvious lie
24|13|Why did they not bring four witnesses to it? But since they did not bring witnesses, then verily they stand forth as liars in the sight of Allah
24|14|And but for the grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, an awful doom would have seized you, for that which you glibly and hastily spread abroad
24|15|Behold, you received it with your tongues, and spoke with your mouths what you had no knowledge of, and deemed it a light thing, while it was most grave in the sight of Allah
24|16|And why, when you heard it, did you not say, "It is not for us to speak of this? Glory be to Thee, O Allah, this is an awful slander
24|17|Allah admonishes you that you return not to the like of it ever, if you be believers
24|18|And He expounds to you His revelations, for Allah is Knower, Wise
24|19|Verily, those who love to see slander (or scandal) broadcast amongst the believers, for them is grievous woe in this world and the Hereafter; Allah knows, but you know not
24|20|And but for the grace of Allah upon you, and His mercy, and that Allah is kind and compassionate
24|21|O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Satan, for he who follows the footsteps of Satan, verily, he bids you filth (the shameful) and wrong. Had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy unto you, not one of you would have grown pu
24|22|And let not those amongst you who have plenty (dignity and ease and ample means) swear that they will not give aught to their kinsman and the needy and those who are fugitives from their homes in the cause of Allah, but let them forgive and show indulgenc
24|23|Verily, those who slander (cast aspersions) on virtuous (or chaste) women who have been careless (indiscreet) but believing, shall be cursed in this world and the Hereafter; theirs will be an awful doom
24|24|On the day when their tongues and hands and feet shall testify against them as to what they used to do
24|25|On that day Allah will pay them their just due; and they shall know that Allah, He is the Manifest Truth
24|26|Vile (impure) women are for vile (impure) men, and vile men for vile women. Good women are for good men, and good men for good women, such are innocent of what people they say; for them is forgiveness and a noble provision
24|27|O you who believe! Enter not into houses which are not your own, until you have asked permission (announced your presence) and saluted (invoked peace on) the people thereof. That is better for you; per chance (or possibly) you may be mindful
24|28|And if you find no one therein, then enter not until permission is given you, and if it be said unto you, "Go away." then go away, for it is purer for you; Allah knows what you do
24|29|It is no crime against you that you enter uninhabited houses, wherein is comfort for you; but Allah knows what you proclaim and what you hide
24|30|Say to the believing men that they cast down their looks and guard their modesty; that is purer for them; verily, Allah is well aware of what they do
24|31|And say to the believing women that they cast down their looks and guard their modesty, and display not their ornaments, except those which are obvious from the outside; and let them pull their veils over their bosoms and not display their ornaments (and beauty) save to their husbands and fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers´ sons, or their sisters´ sons, or their women, or what their right hands possess (slaves), or their male attendants who are incapable (eunuchs or old men), or to children who do not note women´s nakedness; and that they beat not with their feet to draw attention to their hidden ornaments; but turn you all to Allah, O you believers, in order that you may succeed (or prosper or attain bliss)
24|32|And marry the single amongst you, and the righteous among your slaves and your handmaidens. If they be poor, Allah will enrich them of His grace, for Allah encompasses all and knows all
24|33|And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste until Allah gives them means from His grace. And if any of your slaves asks for a Deed in writing (an agreement to purchase their freedom), write it for them if you know any good in them; yea, give them so
24|34|Now have We sent down to you clear revelations, and the example of those who have passed away before you, and as an admonition to those who fear (avoid) evil
24|35|Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth; The similitude of His light is as a niche in which is a lamp, and the lamp is in a glass, the glass is as though it were a brilliant star; it is lit from a blessed tree, an olive neither of the east nor of
24|36|(This lamp is found, or the light is lit) In the houses which Allah has permitted to be exalted and that His name shall be remembered (or mentioned) therein. His praises are celebrated therein mornings and evenings
24|37|By men whom neither merchandise nor selling (commerce) divert from the remembrance of Allah and steadfastness in prayer and charity, who are in awe of the day when heart and eyes shall be transformed
24|38|That Allah may reward them for the best of that which they have done, and give them increase of His bounty; for Allah gives blessings without stint to whom He will
24|39|But those who disbelieve, their works are like the mirage in a desert, the thirsty suppose it to be water till when he comes to it he finds nothing, but he finds, instead, Allah is with him; and He will pay him his account, for Allah is quick to take acco
24|40|Or like darkness on a deep sea. There covers it a wave above which is another wave, above which is a cloud, layers of darkness upon darkness; when he puts out his hand he can scarcely see it; for him to whom Allah has given no light, he has no light
24|41|Have you not seen that Allah, He it is whom praise all who are in the heavens and the earth, and the birds in their flight? Each one knows its worship and its praise, and Allah is aware of what they do
24|42|And unto Allah belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and unto Allah is the journeying
24|43|Have you not seen how Allah drives the clouds gently, and then gathers them together, then heaps them up (or layers them)? Then you may see the rain coming forth from their midst; and He sends down from the sky mountainous masses wherein is hail; He smite
24|44|Allah alternates the night and the day. Verily, in all these things is a lesson to those endowed with vision
24|45|And Allah created every beast from water, and of them are some that creep upon their bellies, and some that walk upon two legs, and some walk upon four. Allah creates what He wills; verily, Allah has power over all things
24|46|We have, indeed, sent down revelations which make things (hidden) manifest, and Allah guides whom He pleases unto the Straight Way
24|47|They say, "We believe in Allah and in the Messenger, and we obey." But after that some of them turn their backs; they are not really believers
24|48|And when they appeal to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, lo! A section of them is averse
24|49|But had the right been on their side they would have come unto Him willingly enough
24|50|Is there in their heart a disease, or do they doubt, or do they fear lest Allah and His Messenger should deal unjustly by them?- Nay, it is they who do wrong (or are unjust)
24|51|The speech of the believers, when they appeal unto Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, is only to say, "We hear and we obey;" and such are the successful
24|52|He who obeys Allah and His Messenger and fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, such indeed are the victorious
24|53|They swear by Allah with their most solemn oath that had you ordered them they would surely go forth. Say, "Swear not; obedience is more reasonable; verily, Allah is Informed of what you do
24|54|Say, "Obey Allah and obey the Messenger; but if you turn away then it is for him to do only that wherewith he has been charged, and for you to do only that wherewith you have been charged. If you obey him, you are rightly guided. But the Messenger ha
24|55|Allah promises those of you who believe and do right that He will give them the succession (or make them inheritors to the present rulers), in the earth even as He gave the succession to those before them; and that He will surely establish for them their
24|56|Establish regular worship and regularly pay the Zakah (the poor-tax) and obey the Messenger, in order that you may obtain mercy
24|57|Think not that those who disbelieve can frustrate (the plan of Allah) on earth; their resort is the Fire, and it is indeed an ill destination
24|58|O you who believe! Let those whom your right hands possess (slaves), and the children amongst you who have not reached puberty, ask leave of you on three occasions (before coming into your presence) - before the prayer of dawn, and when you put off your c
24|59|And when your children reach puberty let them ask leave as those before them asked leave. Thus does Allah explain to you His revelations, for Allah is Knower, Wise
24|60|And women past childbearing, who have no hope of marriage, it is no crime for them if they discard their outer garments in such a way as not to display their adornments. But to refrain is better for them, for Allah is Hearer, Knower
24|61|There is no blame upon the blind, nor blame upon the lame, nor blame upon the sick nor on yourselves if you eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters
24|62|Only those are believers who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and when they are with him (the Messenger) upon some common business, go not away until they have asked leave of him. Verily, those who ask your leave they it is who believe in Allah and His
24|63|Make not the calling (or summons) of the Messenger among you like your calling (or summons) one to the other. Allah knows those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let those who conspire to evade his orders beware lest grief or painful punishmen
24|64|Verily, to Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. He knows their condition, and the Day when they shall be returned unto Him so that He may inform them of what they did. Allah is Knower of all things
25|1|Blessed is He Who has revealed unto His servants the Discrimination (or Criterion) that it may be an admonition to all peoples
25|2|He unto Whom belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, He has chosen no son nor has He any partner in the sovereignty. He has created everything, and then given it its measure (proportions)
25|3|Yet they take beside Him other gods who create not aught, but are themselves created, and cannot control harm or profit for themselves, and can control neither death, nor life, nor resurrection
25|4|And those who disbelieve say, "This is nothing but a lie which he has invented, and another people hath helped him with it;" But, in truth, it is they who have wrought an injustice and a falsehood
25|5|And they say, "Old folks´ tales, which he has written down while they are dictated to him morning and evening
25|6|Say, "He Who knows the secret of the heavens and the earth, He has revealed it; verily, He is ever Forgiving, Merciful
25|7|And they say, "What ails this messenger that he eats food and walks in the markets? Why is not an angel sent down unto him, to be a Warner with him
25|8|Or a treasure thrown down unto him, or why has he not a garden to eat from....?" And the unjust say, "You only follow a man bewitched (or obsessed)
25|9|See how they coin similitudes for you, so that they are all astray and cannot find a way
25|10|Blessed is He Who, if He will, can make for you better than all that - Gardens beneath which rivers flow - and can make for you castles (mansions, palaces)
25|11|Nay, but they deny the coming of the Hour, and for those who deny the Hour We have prepared a blaze
25|12|When it sees them from a far place, they shall hear its raging and roaring
25|13|And when they are thrown into a narrow place thereof, chained together, they shall pray for destruction there
25|14|Pray not that day for one destruction, but pray for many destructions
25|15|Say, "Is that better or the Garden of Eternity (Immortality) which is promised unto those who fear (ward off evil), which is ever a reward and a goal
25|16|Therein abiding, they shall have all that they desire. It is for your Lord a promise that must be fulfiled
25|17|And on the day when He will gather them and that which they served beside Allah, He will say, "Was it you who misled these my servants or did they themselves wander from the way
25|18|They will say, "Be you glorified! It was not befitting for us to take any patrons besides Thee; but Thou didst give them and their fathers ease until they forgot the Reminder and became a lost people
25|19|And thus have they proved you liars for what you say, and you cannot avert or obtain help. And he among you who does wrong, We will make him taste great torment
25|20|We have not sent before you any messengers, but lo! They ate food and walked in the markets; but We have made some of you a test for others: will you be steadfast? your Lord is ever Seer
25|21|And those who look not for a meeting with Us say, "Why are angels not sent down to us, or we do not see our Lord?" Assuredly they have an arrogant conceit of themselves and excessive is their insolence
25|22|On the day when they behold the angels, there will be no good tidings for the guilty; and the angels will say, "There is a forbidden barrier for you
25|23|And We will turn on to the works which they have done, and make them like dust scattered
25|24|The companions of the Garden on that day shall be in a better abiding-place and a better noonday rest
25|25|The day the heavens shall be cleft asunder with the clouds, and the angels shall be sent down, descending in ranks
25|26|The true kingdom (sovereignty, dominion) on that day shall belong to the Beneficent, and it shall be a hard day for the disbelievers
25|27|And the day when the wrongdoers shall bite his hands and say, "O, would that I had chosen the way with the Messenger
25|28|O, woe is me! Would that I had not taken such a one for a friend
25|29|He verily led me astray from the Reminder after it had reached me. Satan is ever a deserter of men
25|30|And the Messenger says, "My Lord! Verily, my own people have made this Quran of no account
25|31|Thus have We made for every prophet an opponent from among the guilty; but your Lord is sufficient as good guide and helper
25|32|Those who disbelieve said, "Why is not the Quran sent down to him all at once (in one piece)?" It is revealed as it is so that We may strengthen your heart therewith, and We have rehearsed it to you gradually, in well-arranged stages
25|33|And they bring you no similitude but We reveal the truth and the best interpretation thereof (or a better argument)
25|34|They who shall be gathered upon their faces into hell, such are worse in plight and further from the path
25|35|And We did give to Moses the Book, and placed with him his brother, Aaron, as a minister (or Priest)
25|36|And We said, "Go you together to the people who have denied Our revelations. Then We destroyed them with utter destruction
25|37|And the people of Noah, when they denied the messenger, We drowned them, and made them a sign for mankind. We prepared for the wrongdoers a grievous woe
25|38|And (the tribes of) A´ad and Thamud and the people of Ar´Rass, and many generations between them
25|39|For each of them We set forth parables and examples, and each one have We utterly ruined
25|40|Indeed, they have come past the cities which were rained on with an evil rain; have they not seen them? Nay, but they fear not the Resurrection (or hope not for resurrection)
25|41|And when they see you (Muhammad) they only took you for a jest, "Is this he whom Allah has sent as a Messenger
25|42|He well-nigh leads us astray from our gods, had we not been constant to them." But they shall know, when they see the torment, who errs most from the path
25|43|Have you considered him who takes for his god his own lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions)? Would you then be guardian over him
25|44|Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are but like the cattle, nay, they are further astray in the path
25|45|Have you not seen how your Lord spreads the shadow? Had He willed He could have made it still - We make the sun its guide
25|46|Then We contract it towards Us with a gradual contraction in easy stages
25|47|And He it is who made the night a covering for you; and sleep for repose, and made the day a resurrection
25|48|And He it is who sent the winds as glad tidings heralding His mercy; and We send down purifying water from the sky
25|49|That We may quicken therewith the dead land, and slake the thirst of the things We have created - beasts and men in great numbers
25|50|And verily, We have repeated it (the lesson) in various ways among them that they may remember; but most of mankind begrudge aught save ingratitude
25|51|But, had We pleased, We could have raised a Warner in every village (or population centre)
25|52|So obey not the disbelievers, but strive against them herewith (with the Quran) with great endeavour
25|53|He it is who has set free the two bodies of water (rivers and seas), one palatable and sweet, and the other salty and bitter, and has set a barrier between them, forbidding passage
25|54|And He it is who has created man from water, and has appointed for him kindred by blood and kindred by marriage for your Lord is ever Powerful
25|55|Yet they worship beside Allah what can neither profit them nor harm them; but the disbeliever is ever a partisan of evil against his Lord
25|56|We have only sent you to give glad tidings and as a Warner
25|57|Say, "I ask you for no reward for this, save that whoever will may choose a way unto his Lord
25|58|And rely you upon the Living One who dies not; and celebrate His praise; He is sufficient as Knower about the faults of His servants
25|59|He who created the heavens and the earth, and what is between them, in six days, and then mounted the Throne; the Beneficent! Ask any one who is aware concerning Him
25|60|And when it is said unto them, "Adore you the Beneficent", they say, "What is the Beneficent? Shall we adore what you do order us?" And it only increases their aversion
25|61|Blessed be He who placed in the heavens mansions (constellations) of stars, and has placed therein a great lamp and an illuminating moon
25|62|And He it is who made the night and the day alternating, for him who desires to remember or who desires thankfulness
25|63|And the faithful servants of the Beneficent are those who walk upon the earth modestly, and when the ignorant (or foolish) address them, answer, "Peace
25|64|And those who pass the night before their Lord, prostrate and standing
25|65|And those who say, "Our Lord! Avert from us the doom of hell; verily, its wrath is indeed a grievous affliction
25|66|Verily, indeed an evil abode and state
25|67|And those who when they spend are neither extravagant nor miserly, but who always take their stand between the two
25|68|And those who call not upon another god with Allah; nor take the life which Allah has forbidden save in justice; nor commit adultery (or fornication) - for he who does that shall pay the penalty
25|69|The penalty will be doubled for him on the Day of Judgment, and he will abide therein despised forever
25|70|Save he who repents and believes and does righteous work; for such Allah will change their evil deeds to good deeds. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful
25|71|And he who repents and does good, verily, he has turned to Allah with true conversion
25|72|And those who will not witness vanity (frivolous, foolish, ignorant, futile and useless things, falsehood); and when they pass by vain (frivolous, foolish, futile, ignorant, false) discourse, pass by with dignity
25|73|And those who when they are reminded of the revelations of their Lord, fall not deaf and blind thereat
25|74|And those who say, "Our Lord! Grant us comfort and cheer from our wives and offspring, and make us models for all those who ward off evil (or to lead the righteous)
25|75|These shall be rewarded with a high place for that they were steadfast: and they will meet therein with welcome and peace
25|76|Abiding therein for ever; a happy abode and state
25|77|Say (to the rejecters), "My Lord is not concerned (or uneased) because of you if you call not on Him (in prayer); but you have denied (Him or the Truth), therefore will there be judgment

26|2|These are the verses of the Book that clarifies (illuminates)
26|3|It may be that you are tormenting your soul that they will not be believers
26|4|If We will, We can send down upon them from heaven a sign which would bend their necks in humility
26|5|But there comes not to them a fresh Reminder from the Beneficent that they did not turn away from
26|6|They have indeed rejected the message, but soon enough will come to them the truth of that at which they mocked
26|7|Have they not looked to the earth, how We caused to grow therein of every noble kind
26|8|Verily, in that is indeed a sign; but most of them are not believers
26|9|Lo! Your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful
26|10|And when your Lord called Moses, saying, "Go to the iniquitous people
26|11|To the people of Pharaoh. Will they not fear (Allah or doing evil)
26|12|Said he, "My Lord! Verily, I fear that they will call me liar
26|13|And my breast will be straitened, and my tongue is not fluent; so send then unto Aaron (or send them Aaron)
26|14|For they have a crime against me. And I fear that they may kill me
26|15|Said He, "Not so; but go, both, with Our signs; verily, We are with you listening
26|16|And go to Pharaoh and say, ´Verily, we bear a message from the Lord of the Worlds
26|17|(saying) Send you with us the children of Israel.´
26|18|And he said, "Did we not cherish you as a child amongst us? And did you not dwell amongst us for many years of your life
26|19|And you did do a deed which you know you did do (he slew an Egyptian), and you are of the ungrateful
26|20|Moses said, "I did commit this, and I was of those who erred
26|21|And I fled from you when I feared you. But my Lord granted me better judgment, and made me one of His messengers
26|22|And this is the favour you have reproached me with, that you have enslaved the children of Israel
26|23|Said Pharaoh, "Who is the Lord of the Worlds
26|24|Said he, "The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between the two, if you want certainty
26|25|Said he (Pharaoh) to those about him, "Do you not hear
26|26|Moses said, "(He is) your Lord and the Lord of your fathers from the beginning
26|27|Said he (Pharaoh), "Verily, the messenger who is sent to you is surely mad
26|28|Moses said, "(He is) The Lord of the East and of the West, and of all that is between the two, if you did but understand
26|29|Said he (Pharaoh), "If you do take a god besides me I will surely place you among the prisoners
26|30|Moses said, "What, if I come to you with something obvious (to the senses)
26|31|Said he, "Bring it, if you are of those who tell the truth
26|32|And he threw down his rod, and, behold, it was an obvious serpent
26|33|And he plucked out his hand, and, behold, it was white to the spectators
26|34|He (Pharaoh) said to the chiefs around him, "Verily, this is a knowing (expert) magician (sorcerer, wizard)
26|35|He desires to turn you out of your land. What is it then you counsel (advise, suggest)
26|36|They said, "Put him off a while, him and his brother, and send into the cities
26|37|To collect and bring to you every knowing (expert) magician
26|38|And the magicians assembled at the appointed time on a well-known day (a festival day)
26|39|And it was said to the people, "Are you assembling
26|40|(They said), "Aye, so that we may follow the magicians if they win
26|41|And when the sorcerers came they said unto Pharaoh, "Will we have a sure reward if we win
26|42|He said, "Yes; and, verily, you shall then be of those who are brought nigh to me (or to my throne in affection and rank)
26|43|And Moses said to them, "Throw down what you have to throw
26|44|So they threw down their ropes and their rods and said, "By Pharaoh´s might, verily, it is we who shall be the winners
26|45|And Moses threw down his rod, and, lo, it swallowed up what they had falsely devised
26|46|And the magicians threw themselves down, in obeisance
26|47|Saying, "We believe in the Lord of the Worlds
26|48|The Lord of Moses and Aaron
26|49|Said Pharaoh, "Do you believe in Him ere I give you permission? Surely, he is your leader (in a conspiracy) who has taught you sorcery. But soon you shall know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides, and I will crucify yo
26|50|They said, "No matter! Verily, unto our Lord do we (or "will we" or "in any case") return
26|51|Verily, we ardently hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, for we are the foremost of believers
26|52|And We inspired Moses, saying, "Journey by night with my servants; verily, you are pursued
26|53|And Pharaoh sent into the cities summoners
26|54|(Who said) "Verily, these are a small company
26|55|And, verily, they are offenders against us
26|56|But we are a multitude and wary
26|57|So we (or We) expelled them out of gardens and springs
26|58|And treasures, and noble positions
26|59|Thus it was, but We made the children of Israel inheritors of these things
26|60|And they pursued them at dawn
26|61|And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Moses said, "Verily, we are overtaken
26|62|Said he, "Not so; verily, my Lord is with me. He will guide me
26|63|And We inspired Moses, saying, "Strike the sea with your rod." And it was cleft asunder, and each part was like a mighty mountain
26|64|And then We brought the others thither
26|65|And We saved Moses and those with him, every one
26|66|We drowned the others
26|67|Lo! Herein is indeed a sign: but most of them are not believers
26|68|And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful
26|69|And recite unto them the story of Abraham
26|70|When he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship
26|71|They said, "We worship idols, and we are devoted to them
26|72|He said, "Can they hear you when you call
26|73|Or benefit you, or harm you
26|74|They said, "No; but we found our fathers doing thus
26|75|He said, "Have you considered that which you worship (or serve)
26|76|You and your forefathers
26|77|Verily, they are foes unto me, save only the Lord of the Worlds
26|78|Who created me and does guide me
26|79|And who feeds me food and waters me
26|80|And when I am sick He heals me
26|81|He who causes me to die, and then gives me life again
26|82|And who, I ardently hope, will forgive me my sins on the Day of Judgment
26|83|My Lord, grant me wisdom (or judgment), and let me join the righteous
26|84|And give me a good report amongst the later generations
26|85|And place me among the heirs of the Garden of Delight
26|86|And forgive my father. Verily, he is of those who err
26|87|And disgrace me not on the Day when they are raised
26|88|The Day when wealth shall profit not, nor sons
26|89|But only he who comes to Allah with a whole (sound) heart
26|90|And the Garden will be brought near to the righteous
26|91|And Hell shall be brought forth plainly to those who go astray
26|92|And it will be said unto them, ´Where is all that you used to worship
26|93|Beside Allah? Can they help you, or help themselves?´
26|94|Then they shall be hurled therein, they and the seducers
26|95|And the hosts of Iblis all together
26|96|They shall say, while they quarrel therein
26|97|´By Allah! In truth, we were in manifest error
26|98|´When we made you equal to the Lord of the Worlds
26|99|´It was only the guilty who led us astray
26|100|´But now we have no intercessors
26|101|´And no loving friend
26|102|´Oh, that we had another turn on earth, that we might be of the believers.´
26|103|Verily, in this is indeed a sign, yet most of them are not believers
26|104|And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful
26|105|The people of Noah denied the messengers
26|106|When their brother Noah said to them, "Will you not fear (Allah and avoid evil)
26|107|Verily, I am a faithful messenger to you
26|108|So keep your duty to Allah, and obey me
26|109|I ask you for it no wages; my wage is only the concern of the Lord of the Worlds
26|110|So fear Allah and obey me
26|111|They said, "Shall we believe in you, when the meanest follow you
26|112|He said, "What knowledge have I of what they were doing
26|113|Their account is only with my Lord, if you but understood
26|114|And I am not here to drive away the believers
26|115|I am only a plain Warner
26|116|They said, "Verily, if you desist not, O Noah! you shall surely be of those who are stoned
26|117|Said he, "My Lord! Verily, my own people reject me
26|118|Judge you between us openly, and deliver me and those of the believers who are with me
26|119|So We saved him and those with him in the laden ark
26|120|Then We drowned the rest
26|121|Verily, in this indeed is a sign, yet most of them are not believers
26|122|And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful
26|123|And (the people of) A´ad denied the messengers
26|124|When their brother Hud said to them, "Will you not fear
26|125|Verily, I am to you a faithful messenger
26|126|So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
26|127|I ask of you no fee for it; my wage is only the concern of the Lord of the Worlds
26|128|Do you build on every height a monument of vain delight
26|129|And build you fine strong buildings that per chance (or possibly) you may be immortal
26|130|And when you seize by force, assault you like tyrants
26|131|Rather fear Allah and obey me
26|132|And keep your duty to Him who has bestowed on you freely all that you know
26|133|And has aided you with cattle and sons
26|134|And gardens and springs
26|135|Verily, I fear for you the retribution of an awful day
26|136|They said, "It is the same to us if you admonish or are not of those who admonish
26|137|This is nothing but the fable of men of old
26|138|For we are not the ones to be doomed (or tormented)
26|139|And they denied him; therefore, We destroyed them. Verily, in this is a sign, but most of them are not believers
26|140|And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful
26|141|(The tribe of) Thamud denied the messengers
26|142|When their brother Salih said to them, "Will you not fear
26|143|Verily, I am to you a faithful messenger
26|144|So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
26|145|I ask not of you any wages; my wage is the concern only of the Lord of the Worlds
26|146|Shall you be left here secure in that which is before us
26|147|In gardens and springs
26|148|And tilled fields and heavily sheathed palms
26|149|Though you hew out dwellings in the mountain skillfully
26|150|But keep your duty to Allah and obey me
26|151|And obey not the bidding of the extravagant (profligate, wasters)
26|152|Who spread corruption in the earth and mend not their ways
26|153|They said, "You art only of the bewitched
26|154|You art but mortal like us; so bring us a sign, if you are truthful
26|155|He said, "Behold this she-camel (a test of faith). She has the right to drink, and you have a right to drink, each on an appointed day
26|156|Touch her not with evil, lest there seize you the retribution of an awful day
26|157|But they hamstrung her, and on the morrow they repented
26|158|So the retribution seized them; verily, in this is a sign; but most of them are not believers
26|159|And verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful
26|160|The people of Lot denied the messengers
26|161|When their brother Lot said to them, "Will you not fear (Allah or evil)
26|162|Verily, I am to you a faithful messenger
26|163|So keep your duty to Allah and obey me
26|164|I ask you not for it any wages; my wage is only the concern of the Lord of the Worlds
26|165|Do you approach the males of all creatures of the world
26|166|And leave the mates your Lord has created for you? Nay, but you are people who transgress
26|167|They said, "Surely, if you do not desist, O Lot! you shall be of those who are expelled
26|168|Said he, "I am, in truth, of those who hate your conduct
26|169|My Lord! Save me and my people from what they do
26|170|So We saved him and his people, every one
26|171|Except an old woman (Lot´s wife) amongst those who lingered behind
26|172|Then We destroyed the others
26|173|We rained down upon them a shower (of brimstone); and dreadful was the rain for those who had been warned
26|174|Verily, in this is a sign; yet most of them are not believers
26|175|And, verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful
26|176|The Dwellers of the Grove (Midianites) denied the messengers
26|177|Shu´eyb said unto them, "Will you not fear
26|178|Verily, I am to you a faithful messenger
26|179|So do your duty to Allah and obey me
26|180|I ask not of you for it any wages; my wage is only the concern of the Lord of the Worlds
26|181|Give full measure, and be not of those who diminish (give less than due)
26|182|And weigh with a true balance
26|183|And wrong (or cheat) not mankind of their goods; and waste not the land, despoiling it
26|184|And keep your duty unto Him who created you and the generations of the past
26|185|Said they, "You art only of the bewitched
26|186|And you are only a mortal like ourselves; and, verily, we think that you are surely of the liars
26|187|So make portions of the heaven fall down upon us, if you are of the truthful
26|188|Said he, "My Lord knows best what you do
26|189|But they rejected him, so the torment of the day of gloom (Ashes from a volcanic eruption?) seized them. Lo! It was the retribution of an awful day
26|190|Verily, in this is a sign; but most of them are not believers
26|191|Verily, your Lord, He is indeed the Mighty, the Merciful
26|192|And, verily, it is a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds
26|193|Which the Faithful Spirit of Truth (Gabriel) has brought down
26|194|Upon your heart, that you may be one of the Warners
26|195|In plain Arabic language
26|196|And, verily, it is also in the scriptures of the past
26|197|Is it not a sign for them that the learned men of the children of Israel recognize it
26|198|Had We sent it down to any one of any other nation but the Arabs
26|199|And he had read it unto them, they would not have believed therein
26|200|Thus have We made for it a way into the heart of the guilty
26|201|But they will not believe therein until they see the painful doom
26|202|And it shall come to them suddenly when they perceive not
26|203|They will say, "Shall we be reprieved
26|204|What! Do they wish to hasten on Our penalty
26|205|What think you? If We let them enjoy life for years
26|206|And then there comes to them that which they are promised
26|207|That which they had to enjoy will avail them not
26|208|But We destroy not any population but it had its Warners
26|209|For reminder, for We are never unjust
26|210|No devils (or evil ones) brought down this revelation (the Quran)
26|211|It is not fit work for them; nor is it in their power to do so
26|212|Verily, they are banished from listening
26|213|Therefore, call not upon gods other than Allah, lest you be of the doomed
26|214|But warn your people who are near of kin
26|215|And lower your wing (in kindness and protection as the hen does over its chicks) to those of the believers who follow you
26|216|But if they rebel against you, say, "Verily, I am innocent of what you do
26|217|And put your trust (rely) upon the Mighty, the Merciful
26|218|Who sees you when you do stand up (to pray)
26|219|And your postures (or movements) among those who prostrate themselves (in obeisance)
26|220|Verily, He, only He, is the Hearer, the Knower
26|221|Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend
26|222|They descend upon every wicked liar
26|223|And impart what they have heard; but most of them are liars
26|224|As for poets, those follow them who are astray
26|225|Have you not seen how they wander confused in every valley (or by way)
26|226|And that they say that which they do not do
26|227|Save those who believe and do good works, and remember Allah much, and defend themselves after they are wronged. Those who do wrong will come to know with what a turn they shall be turned
27|1|TA SIN. These are the verses of the Quran, a book that clarifies
27|2|A guidance and glad tidings to the believers
27|3|Who establish regular worship and give regular charity and are sure of the Hereafter
27|4|Lo!, As for those who believe not in the Hereafter, We have made for them their works fair-seeming, and they shall wander blindly on
27|5|These are they who shall have grievous torment, and theirs in the Hereafter shall be the greatest loss
27|6|Verily, you receive this Quran from the presence of the Wise, the All-knowing One
27|7|(Remember) When Moses said to his people, "Verily, I perceive a fire, I will bring you there from news; or I will bring you a burning brand that you may be warmed
27|8|But when he reached it he was called, with the words, "Blessed is He Who is in the Fire, and He Who is round about it! And glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Worlds
27|9|O Moses! Verily, I am Allah, the Mighty, the Wise
27|10|Throw down your staff!" But when he saw it writhing as though it was a snake, he turned fleeing, and looked not back. (But it was said to him) "O Moses! Fear not; verily, the messengers fear not in My presence
27|11|Save only those who have done wrong and then substitute good for evil; and, verily, I am Forgiving, Merciful
27|12|Put your hand in they bosom, it shall come forth white without stain (or hurt); one of nine signs to Pharaoh and his people; verily, they are a rebellious, transgressing people
27|13|But when Our signs came to them visibly (that should have opened their eyes), they said, "This is obvious sorcery
27|14|And they denied them, though their souls acknowledged them, for spite and arrogance; but behold the nature of the consequences for the evildoers (transgressors)
27|15|And We gave David and Solomon knowledge; and they both said, "Praise belongs to Allah, Who hath favoured us over many of His believing servants
27|16|And Solomon was David´s heir. He said, "O you people! We have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given abundance; verily, this is manifest grace
27|17|And assembled for Solomon were his hosts of the Jinn and of mankind, and birds, and they were marshalled in battle order
27|18|Until, when they came upon the Valley of the Ants, an ant said, "O you ants! Enter your dwellings, that Solomon and his hosts crush you not unperceiving (unknowing)
27|19|And he (Solomon) smiled, laughing at her speech, and said, "O Lord! Excite (cause) me to be thankful for Thy favour, wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents, and to do righteousness which may please Thee; and include me by Thy Grace amongst Th
27|20|And he reviewed the birds, and said, "How is it that I see not the hoopoe (perhaps used as a spy, messenger or observer or symbolizing one)? Is he then amongst the absent
27|21|I will surely punish him with a severe penalty; or I will slay him unless he brings me clear authority (or reason for his absence)
27|22|But he was not long in coming, and said, "I have compassed (covered territory or found out) what you compassed (covered or understood) not; for I come unto you from Sheba with sure information
27|23|Verily, I found a woman ruling over them, and she was given abundance of all things, and she had a mighty throne
27|24|And I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah, for Satan had made their works fair-seeming to them, and turned them away from the Way (of Truth), so that they are not guided right
27|25|So they will not worship Allah, Who brings forth the secrets in the heavens and the earth, and knows what they hide and what they manifest
27|26|Allah, there is no God but He, the Lord of the Mighty Throne
27|27|Said he (Solomon), "We will see whether you have told the truth, or whether you are of those who lie
27|28|Go with this my letter and throw it before them, then turn away from them, and see what answer they return
27|29|Said she (the Queen of Sheba after she had received the letter), "O you chiefs! Verily, a noble letter has been thrown before me
27|30|It is from Solomon, and, verily, it is as follows, ´In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
27|31|Exalt not yourself against me, but come to me as those who Surrender (unto Allah i.e. as a Muslim)
27|32|She said, "You chiefs! Pronounce for me in my affair (or advise me). I never decide an affair until you testify for me
27|33|They said, "We are endowed with strength, and endowed with martial prowess; but the command is yours, so consider what you will command
27|34|She said, "Verily, kings when they enter a city, despoil it, and demean the mighty ones of its people; thus they will do
27|35|But, verily, I am going to send to them a gift, and will wait to see with what answer the messengers return
27|36|And when the envoy came to Solomon, he (Solomon) said, "Do you offer me wealth, when what Allah has given me is better than what He has given to you? Nay, it is you (not I) who rejoice (exult) in your gifts
27|37|Return unto them, for we will surely come to them with hosts which they cannot resist; and we will surely drive them out thence with shame and they will be humbled
27|38|Said he, "O you chiefs! Which of you will bring me her throne before they come unto me surrendering
27|39|Said an Ifrit (a powerful and cunning demon) of the Jinn, "I will bring it you before you can rise up from your chair of council, for I am strong for such work, and trustworthy
27|40|He who had the knowledge of the Book said, "I will bring it to you before your glance can turn." And when he saw it set down beside him, he (Solomon) said, "This is of my Lord´s grace that He may try me whether I give thanks or am ungrateful - truly, my Lord is rich (independent, free of all needs) and Bountiful
27|41|Said he, "Disguise for her throne; let us see whether she is guided, or whether she is of those who receive no guidance
27|42|And when she came it was said unto her, "Is this your throne?" She said, "It was just like this (it could be the one)." and Solomon said, "We were given knowledge before her, and we had Surrendered (to Allah)
27|43|But that which she worshipped beside Allah diverted her; for she came of people who had no faith
27|44|And it was said to her, "Enter the court." And when she saw it, she thought it was a pool, and she bared her legs (tucked up her skirt to go into it). Said he, "Verily, it is a court paved with glass!" Said she, "My Lord! Verily
27|45|And We sent unto Thamud their brother Salih, saying "Serve Allah;" but behold! they became two parties quarrelling
27|46|Said he, "O my people! Why do you hasten on evil rather than good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah that you may obtain mercy
27|47|They said, "We auger evil of you and those who are with you. Said he, "Your augury is in Allah´s hands; nay, but you are a people who are being tested
27|48|And there were in the city nine persons who despoiled the land and reformed not

27|50|And they plotted a plot, and We plotted a plot while they perceive not
27|51|Behold, what was the nature of the consequences of their plotting, for lo! We destroyed them and their people, everyone
27|52|Thus are their houses in utter ruin, for that they did wrong; verily, in that is a sign to people who have knowledge
27|53|But We saved those who believed and who did fear (or avoid evil)
27|54|And Lot when he said to his people, "Do you commit abomination knowingly
27|55|Must you needs lust after men instead of women? Nay! You are a senseless people
27|56|But the answer of his people was only to say, "Drive out Lot´s family from your city, for they are a folk who would keep pure
27|57|But We saved him and his family except his wife; her We destined to be of those who lingered behind
27|58|And We rained down upon them a shower, and dreadful is the rain for those who have been warned
27|59|Say, "Praise belongs to Allah; and peace be upon His servants whom He has chosen! Is Allah best, or what they associate as partners with Him
27|60|He who created the heavens and the earth; and sends down upon you water from the sky wherewith We cause to grow beautiful orchards, whose trees it has never been yours to grow; is there a God besides Him? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals with Him
27|61|He who made the earth a fixed abode, and placed rivers in its folds; and placed upon it firm mountains; and placed a barrier between the two waters; is there any God besides Allah? Nay, but most of them know not
27|62|He who answers the distressed when he calls upon Him and removes the evil; and has made you Vicegerents (or Successors) in the earth; is there a God besides Allah? Little do they reflect
27|63|He who guides you in the darkness of the land and of the sea; and He who sends winds as heralds of His mercy; is there a God besides Allah? High exalted be Allah above what they associate with Him
27|64|He who began the creation and then reproduces it; and who provides for you from the heaven and the earth; is there any God besides Allah? Bring your proofs if you are truthful
27|65|Say, "None in the heavens or the earth knows the unseen save only Allah; and they perceive not when they shall be raised
27|66|Nay, but does their knowledge reach to the Hereafter? Nay, but they are in doubt concerning it. Nay, but they are blind thereto
27|67|And those who disbelieved say, "What! When we have become dust and (or like) our fathers, shall we indeed be brought forth
27|68|We were promised this, we and our fathers before us, this is nothing but ancient fables
27|69|Say, "Travel in the land and see the nature of the sequel for the guilty
27|70|And grieve not you for them, and be not in distress because of what they plot
27|71|They say, "When shall this promise be if you do tell the truth
27|72|Say; "It may be that a part of what you would hasten is pressing close behind you
27|73|But, verily, your Lord is full of grace to mankind, but most of them will not be thankful
27|74|Verily, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they manifest
27|75|And there is no secret thing in the heaven or the earth, save that it is in a Clear Record
27|76|Verily, this Quran relates to the people of Israel most of that whereon they do dispute
27|77|And, lo! It is a guidance and a mercy to the believers
27|78|Verily, your Lord decides between them by His Wisdom (or Judgment), for He is the Mighty, the Wise
27|79|Rely you then upon Allah, for you stand on obvious Truth
27|80|Verily, you can not make the dead to hear, nor can you make the deaf to hear the call when they turn to flee
27|81|Nor can you guide the blind out of their error. You can make none to hear, save those who believe Our revelations and have Surrendered
27|82|And when the word is fulfiled against them We will bring forth a beast out of the earth (gross materialism?) that shall speak to (or wound) them, because mankind had not faith in Our revelations
27|83|And the Day when We will gather from every nation a troop of those who denied our revelations, and they shall be marshalled
27|84|Until, when they come before their Lord, He will say, "Did you deny my revelations when you had compassed no knowledge thereof? Or what is it that you were doing
27|85|And the Word shall be fulfiled concerning them because they did wrong, and they will not be able to speak
27|86|Did they not see that how We have made the night for them to rest in, and the day to see by? Verily, in that are signs to people who believe
27|87|And the Day when the trumpet shall be blown and all who are in the heavens and the earth shall be startled in fear (or horrified), save whom Allah wills. And all shall come unto Him, humbled
27|88|And you see the mountains (things seemingly firm and reliable) which you do deem firm, drifting away like the passing of the clouds - the work of Allah who orders all things. Verily, He is well aware of what you do
27|89|He who brings a good deed shall have better than its worth; and from the alarm of that day they shall be safe
27|90|But those who bring an evil deed shall be thrown down upon their faces in the Fire. Shall you be rewarded save for what you did
27|91|(Say) I (Muhammad) am commanded to serve the Lord of this land (Mecca) which He has made sacred, and unto Whom belong all things. And I am commanded to be of those who Surrender (unto Him)
27|92|And to recite the Quran; And he who is guided right, is guided right only for his own soul; and as for him who goes astray - say unto him, "I am only of those who warn
27|93|And say, "Praise be to Allah, Who will show you His signs so that you shall recognize them; for your Lord is not heedless of what you do
28|1|TA SIN MIM
28|2|These are the verses of the Book (Scripture) that clarifies
28|3|We narrate unto you something from the history of Moses and Pharaoh with truth unto a people who believe
28|4|Verily, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and divided the people thereof into sects (and casts); one section of them he oppressed, slaughtering their sons and sparing their women. Verily, he was of those who work corruption
28|5|And We wished to be gracious to those who were weakened by oppression in the earth, and to make them models, and to make them the inheritors
28|6|And to establish them firmly in the earth; and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts that which they feared from them
28|7|And We inspired the mother of Moses, saying, "Suckle him; and when you are afraid for him then float him into the river, and fear not and grieve not; verily, We shall restore him to you, and make him of one of Our Messengers
28|8|And Pharaoh´s family picked him up that he might become for them a foe and a grief; for verily, Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinners
28|9|And Pharaoh´s wife said, "He is a joy to my eyes, and to yours. Kill him not; it may be that he will profit us, or that we may take him for a son;" for they perceived not
28|10|And the heart of the mother of Moses became void (empty) on the morrow; she well nigh disclosed him, had We not strengthened her heart that she might be of the believers
28|11|And she said to his (Moses´) sister, "Follow him up." And she (his sister) watched him from afar (or as a stranger), and they perceive not
28|12|And We made unlawful (or unacceptable) for him the wet-nurses. And she (his sister) said, "Shall I guide you to the people of a house who will bring him up for you, and who will be sincere and devoted
28|13|So We restored him to his mother that her eye might be cheered, and that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of them understand not
28|14|And when he reached maturity and was firmly established, We gave him Wisdom and Knowledge; for thus do We reward those who do good
28|15|And he entered into the city at a time when the people thereof were heedless, and he found therein two men fighting; the one of his own sect and the other of his enemies. And he who was of his sect asked his aid against him who was of his enemies. So Mose
28|16|He said, "My Lord! Verily, I have wronged my soul, but forgive me." So He forgave him; verily He is the Forgiving, the Merciful
28|17|He said, "My Lord! For that you have been gracious to me, I will never more be a supporter of the guilty
28|18|And on the morrow he was in the city, fearing, vigilant. And behold, he whom he had helped the day before, cried again to him for help. Moses said unto him, "Verily, you are obviously quarrelsome (a hothead)
28|19|And when he would have attacked him who was the enemy to them both, he said, "O Moses! Would (or desire) you to slay me as you did slay a person yesterday? You would be (or are or desire to be) only a tyrant in the earth; and you would not be (or ar)
28|20|And a man came from the remote parts of the city running. He said, "O Moses! Verily, the chiefs are deliberating concerning you to slay you; therefore go forth; verily, I am to you a sincere adviser
28|21|So he went forth there from, fearing, vigilant. Said he, "Lord, save me from the unjust people
28|22|And when he turned his face towards Midian, he said, "It may be that my Lord will guide me to a smooth and straight path
28|23|And when he came unto the water of Midian he found thereat a group of people watering their flocks. And he found apart from them two women keeping back their flocks. Said he, "What is the matter with you?" They said, "We cannot water our fl
28|24|So he watered their flock for them; then he turned aside into the shade and said, "My Lord! Verily, I stand in need of what good Thou sends down to me
28|25|And one of the two women came to him walking shyly; said she, "Verily, my father calls you, to reward you with a payment for that you did water our flocks for us." And when he came to him and related to him his whole story, he said, "Fear n
28|26|One of the two women said, "O my father! Hire him; verily, the best of those whom you can hire is the strong and faithful
28|27|Said he, "Verily, I desire to marry you to one of these daughters of mine, on condition that you do serve me for hire eight years; and if you shall fulfil ten it is of your own accord; for I desire not to make it hard for you. Allah willing, you will
28|28|Said he, "That is settled between you and me. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there will be no ill-will (or injustice) against (or in) me, for Allah is surety over (witness of or approves of) what we say
28|29|And when Moses had fulfiled the appointed time, and was travelling with his people, he perceived in the mountain a fire and said to his family, "Tarry you here; verily, I have perceived a fire; I hope to bring you tidings thence, or a brand of fire t
28|30|And when he came to it he was called by a voice, from the right side of the valley, in the blessed field, out of a tree, "O Moses! Verily, I am Allah the Lord of the Worlds
28|31|So throw down your rod." And when he saw it writhing as though it were a snake, he turned away and fled and did not turn. "O Moses! Approach and fear not, verily, you are amongst the secure
28|32|Thrust your hand into your bosom, it shall come out white, without hurt; and then fold again your wing, that you do now stretch out through dread (i.e. guard your heart from fear); for these are two signs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Verily
28|33|Said he, "My Lord! Verily, I have killed a person amongst them, and I fear that they will kill me
28|34|My brother Aaron, he is more eloquent of tongue than I; send him then with me to verify (confirm, support) me. Verily, I fear that they will deny me
28|35|He said, "We will strengthen your arm with your brother; and We give you both authority (or power), and they shall not reach (touch) you for Our signs (they will make you triumphant). You two and those who follow you shall gain the upper hand
28|36|And when Moses came to them with Our manifest signs, they said, "This is naught but invented magic; we have not heard of this amongst our forefathers
28|37|Moses said, "My Lord is best aware of who comes with guidance from Him, and whose end shall be the best. Verily, the unjust shall not be successful
28|38|And Pharaoh said, "O you chiefs! I know of no God for you except me; then set me a Fire, O Haman! To bake some clay and make for me a tower, so that I may mount up to the God of Moses; for, verily, I think he is of those who lie
28|39|And he became inflated with pride, he and his armies in the land, without justification; and thought that they would not be returned to Us
28|40|And We overtook him and his army, and We flung them into the sea; behold, then, what was the end of the unjust
28|41|But We made them models (examples or leaders) calling (or leading) to the fire; and on the Day of Resurrection they shall not be helped
28|42|And We followed them up in this world with a curse; and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be among the abhorred
28|43|And We gave Moses the Book, after that We had destroyed the former generations, to give insight to mankind, and a guidance and a mercy; per chance (or possibly), they may reflect
28|44|You (Muhammad) were not upon the Western side when We expounded unto Moses his mission, nor were you of the witnesses (of those events)
28|45|But We raised up other generations, and long were the ages that passed over them; but you were not a dweller among the people of Midian, reciting to them Our signs; but We kept sending our Messengers
28|46|Nor were you by the side of the mountain when We called; yet are you sent as a mercy from your Lord, that you may warn a people to whom no Warner has come before you that per chance (or possibly) they may be give heed
28|47|Otherwise, if a disaster should befall them for what their hands have sent before, they should say, "Our Lord! Why did Thou not send to us a messenger that we might have followed Thy revelations and been of the believers
28|48|But when the truth comes to them from Us they say, "Why are not signs given to him the like of what Moses was given." Did they not disbelieve in what Moses was given before? They say, "Two works of sorcery back up each other (The Torah and)
28|49|Say, "Bring, then, a book from Allah which shall be a better guide than both that I may follow it, if you are truthful
28|50|And if they cannot answer you, then know that they follow their own lusts (prejudices, fantasies, superstitions); and who is more in error than he who follows his own lust without guidance from Allah? Verily, Allah guides not a wrong doing people
28|51|And We caused the Word to reach them, per chance (or possibly) they may be mindful
28|52|Those to whom We gave the Book before it (the Quran), they believe therein
28|53|And when it is recited to them they say, "We believe in it. It is the Truth from Our Lord. Verily, we were, even before it came, of those who Surrender (or were Muslim)
28|54|These shall be given their reward twice over, because they were steadfast, and repelled evil with good, and spend of what We have bestowed upon them
28|55|And when they hear vain talk, they turn away from it and say, "We have our works, and you have your works. Peace be upon you! We do not seek the ignorant
28|56|Verily, you can not guide whom you do like, but Allah guides whom He wills; for He knows best who are to be guided
28|57|And they say, "If we follow the Guidance we shall be snatched away from the land." Have We not established for them a safe sanctuary, to which are imported the fruits of all things as a provision from Us? But most of them know not
28|58|How many a community have We destroyed that exulted in its means of subsistence? Yonder are their dwellings which have not been inhabited after them, except for a while. And We, even We, are the inheritors
28|59|But your Lord would never destroy a community until He has sent to its centre a messenger to recite to them Our signs; nor would We destroy populations unless their people practiced iniquity
28|60|Whatever thing you may be given, it is a provision for the life of this world and the adornment thereof; but that which Allah has is better and more enduring. Have you then no sense
28|61|Is He to whom We have promised a goodly promise, which he shall meet with, like him to whom We have given the enjoyment in the life of this world, and who on the Day of Resurrection shall be of the arraigned (brought up to deserve punishment)
28|62|And on the Day when He will call them and say, "Where are My partners which you imagined
28|63|And those concerning whom the Word will have come true shall say, "Our Lord! These are those whom we have seduced away; we seduced them as we were seduced ourselves: but we declare our innocence before Thee - they did not worship us
28|64|And it will be said, "Call upon your pretend partners; and they will call upon them, but they will not answer them, and they shall see the Doom. Ah, would that they had been guided right
28|65|And on the Day when He shall call unto them and say, "What was it you answered the messengers
28|66|And history shall be obscure to them on that day, nor shall they ask each other
28|67|But, as for him who repents and believes and does right, it may be that he will be among the successful
28|68|For your Lord brings to pass what He pleases and chooses; they have never the choice! Glorified be Allah and exalted above all they associate with Him
28|69|Your Lord knows what they conceal in their breasts and what they manifest
28|70|He is Allah; there is no God but He; to Him belongs all praise, in the first place (or state) and the last; and His is the command; and unto Him shall you return
28|71|Have you considered, if Allah were to make for you the night endless until the Day of Resurrection, who is the god, but Allah, to bring you light? Will you not then hear
28|72|Say, "Have you considered, if Allah were to make for you the day endless until the Day of Judgment, who is the god, except Allah, to bring you the night to rest therein? Can you not then see
28|73|But of His mercy He has made for you the night and the day, that you may rest therein, and crave of His grace, per chance (or possibly) you may give thanks
28|74|And the day when He shall call them and say, "Where are my partners whom you did pretend were such
28|75|And We will pluck from every nation a witness; and We will say, "Bring your proof and know that the truth belongs to Allah". And that which they had devised shall stray away from them
28|76|Qarun (Korah) was of the people of Moses, but he behaved insolently (oppressed them); and We gave him so much treasure that the keys thereof would have been a burden on men endowed with strength. When his people said to him, "Exult not; verily, Allah
28|77|But seek the abode of the Hereafter through what Allah has given you, and forget not your portion in this world, and do good as Allah has done good to you; and seek not corruption in the earth; verily, Allah loves not corrupters
28|78|Said he, "I have only been given it because of the knowledge which I possess." Knew he not that Allah had destroyed before him many generations of those who were mightier than he in strength and greater in following? But the guilty are not asked
28|79|And he went out amongst the people in his pomp. Those who desired the life of this world said, "O would that we had the like of what Qarun has been given! Verily, he is lord of mighty fortune
28|80|But those who had been given knowledge said, "Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for him who believes and does right; but none shall obtain it except the steadfast
28|81|So We caused the earth to open up and swallow him with his house; and he had no troop to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who could save themselves
28|82|And on the morrow those who had yearned for his place the day before said, "Ah! Allah enlarges provision to whom He pleases of His servants, or He restricts it for whom He will. Had not Allah been gracious unto us, the earth would have cleft open and
28|83|That Home of the Hereafter, We assign it unto those who seek not arrogant oppression in the earth, nor yet corruption, and the end is for the righteous
28|84|He who brings a good deed shall have better than it; and he who brings an evil deed - those who do evil deeds shall only be rewarded for that which they have done
28|85|Verily, He who hath ordained the Quran for you will surely bring you back to the Place of Return (Mecca or Home in Heaven). Say, "My Lord knows best who brings guidance, and who is in error manifest
28|86|You had no hope that the Book (Scripture) would be inspired in you, but it is a mercy from your Lord! Be not, therefore, a helper of those who disbelieve
28|87|And let them not divert you from the revelations of Allah after they have been sent down to you; but call mankind unto your Lord and be not of the idolaters
28|88|And call not upon any other God along with Allah; there is no God but He. Everything is perishable (or will perish), except His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him shall you return
29|1|ALIF LAM MIM
29|2|Do men imagine that they will be left alone because they say, "We believe," and not be tested
29|3|We did try those who were before you, and Allah will surely know those who are sincere, and He will surely know those who feign
29|4|Do those who do evil reckon that they can outstrip Us? Evil is it that which they judge
29|5|He who looks forward to the meeting with Allah, - verily, the appointed time is surely nigh, and He is the Hearer and Knower
29|6|And he who strives, strives only for his own soul; for verily, Allah is altogether Independent of (His) creatures (or the worlds)
29|7|Those who believe and do right, We will surely blot out all evil from (or in) them; and reward them according to the best of their deeds (or with better than their deeds)
29|8|We have enjoined on man kindness to parents; but if they strive to make you join with Me that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return, and I will inform you of that which you did
29|9|But those who believe and do right, We will surely make them enter amongst the righteous
29|10|And there are those among men who say, "We believe in Allah!" but when they suffer for the sake of Allah, they mistake the persecution of men for the punishment of Allah; but if help come from your Lord they will say, "Verily, we were with
29|11|Allah surely knows those who believe, and surely knows the hypocrites
29|12|And those who disbelieved said to those who believed, "Follow our way (religion), we will bear your sins. But they cannot bear aught of their sins; verily, they are liars
29|13|But they shall surely bear their own burdens, and other burdens besides their own; and they shall surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning what they devised
29|14|And We sent Noah to his people, and he dwelt among them for a thousand save fifty years; and the deluge engulfed them while they persisted in evil-doing
29|15|But We saved him and the company of the ark, and made it a sign unto the worlds (all peoples or creatures)
29|16|And Abraham, when he said to his people, "Serve Allah and fear Him, that is better for you if you did but know
29|17|You serve instead of Allah only idols and you only invent a lie; verily, those whom you serve beside Allah own (control) no provision for you. So seek your provision from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks to Him; unto Him shall you return
29|18|But if you deny this, then know that nations before you have denied it. The messenger has only to convey the message plainly
29|19|See they not how Allah produces creation, and then reproduces it? Verily, for Allah it is easy
29|20|Say, "Travel you in the earth, and behold how Allah originated creation; so will He produce a later creation. Verily, Allah has power over all things
29|21|He punishes whom He will, and bestows mercy on whom He will; and towards Him are you turned
29|22|You cannot make Him powerless (escape Him) in the earth, nor in the heavens; nor have you beside Allah a friend or a helper
29|23|And those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah and in their meeting with Him, these shall despair of My mercy; and for these is grievous woe
29|24|But the answer of his people was only to say, "Kill him" or "Burn him!" But Allah saved him from the fire; verily, in that are signs unto a people who have faith
29|25|He said, "Verily, you take beside Allah idols, through mutual friendship in the life of this world; but on the Day of Judgment you shall deny each other, and shall curse each other, and your resort shall be the fire, and you shall have none to help
29|26|And Lot believed him and said, "Verily, I flee unto (or for the sake of) my Lord! Verily, He, only He, is the Mighty, the Wise
29|27|And We granted Abraham Isaac and Jacob; and We placed in his seed the Prophethood and the Scriptures; and We gave him his reward in this world; and, verily, in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous
29|28|And Lot! (Remember) When he said to his people, "Verily, you commit an abomination such as no creature did before you
29|29|Do you approach men? And cut off the highway? And practice wickedness in your assemblies?" But his people gave no answer but this, "Bring us the Wrath of Allah, if you speak the truth
29|30|Said he, "My Lord! Help me against a people who do evil
29|31|And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the glad tidings, they said, "We are about to destroy the people of these cities. Verily, the people thereof are evil-doers
29|32|Said he, "Verily, in it is Lot." They said, "We are best aware of who is therein; we shall of a surety save him and his people, except his wife, who is of those who lag behind
29|33|And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was troubled on account of them, and felt powerless to protect them. But they said, "Fear not, neither grieve; we are about to save you and your people, except your wife, who is of those who lag behind
29|34|Verily, we are about to send down upon the people of this city a horror from heaven, for that they are evil-livers
29|35|And, verily, of that We have left a manifest sign unto a people who have sense
29|36|And unto Midian We sent their brother Shu´eyb, and he said, "My people, serve Allah, and fear the Last Day; and do not evil, making mischief in the land, (despoiling it)
29|37|But they denied him; and the convulsion seized them, and on the morrow they lay prostrate in their dwellings
29|38|And A´ad and Thamud! But their fate is plain to you from their ruined habitations. Satan made their deeds fair seeming unto them, and turned them from the Way, gifted with intelligence and skill though they were
29|39|And Korah, Pharaoh and Haman! Moses did come to them with clear signs, but they were inflated with pride in the earth. Yet they could not outstrip Us
29|40|And each of them We seized in his sin; and of them were some against whom We sent a sandstorm; and some were caught by a mighty Blast; and some We caused the earth to swallow; and some We drowned. It was not Allah who injured (or oppressed, wronged) them
29|41|The similitude of those who choose other patrons than Allah, is as the likeness of a spider, that takes to himself a house; and, lo! The frailest of all houses is the spider´s house, if they but knew
29|42|Verily, Allah knows whatever thing they call upon beside Him; for He is the Mighty, the Wise
29|43|As for these similitudes (parables), We have coined for mankind, but none will understand them, save the wise
29|44|Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth. Verily, in this is a sign for those have faith
29|45|Recite what has been inspired in you of the Book; and establish worship. Verily, worship preserves from shameful deeds and iniquity, but surely the remembrance (or mention) of Allah is more important; and Allah knows what you do
29|46|And argue not with the people of the Book, unless with better means; except with those who have done wrong amongst them and say, "We believe in what is sent down to us, and what has been sent down to you; our God and your God is One, and unto Him we
29|47|Thus did We send down to you the Book; and those unto whom We gave the Book (Scriptures) before will believe therein, and of these (Pagan Arabs) also there are some who believe therein. None reject Our revelations save disbelievers
29|48|You (Muhammad) could not recite before this any Book (or Scripture), nor write it with your right hand, for then, indeed, might those who deal (or talk) in vanities (trivialities, falsehoods, irrelevancies) have doubted
29|49|Nay, but it is a clear revelation in the heart of those who are endowed with knowledge, and none deny Our revelations save the wrongdoers (or unjust)
29|50|And still they say, "Why have not signs been sent down upon him from his Lord." Say, "Verily, signs are with Allah only, and I am but a plain Warner
29|51|Is it not enough for them that We have sent down to you the Book which you do recite to them? Verily, in that is a mercy and a reminder to a people who believe
29|52|Say, "Allah is sufficient witness between me and you. He knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and those who believe in vanities (falsehoods, frivolities) and disbelieve in Allah, they it is who are the losers
29|53|They will wish you to hasten on the doom (punishment); but were it not that a term had been appointed, the doom would have come upon them ere now. And verily it will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not
29|54|They ask you to hurry on the doom, but, verily, hell encompasses the disbelievers
29|55|On the Day when the Doom (or Wrath) shall overwhelm them from above them and from beneath their feet, and He will say, "Taste that which you have done
29|56|O my servants who believe! Verily, My earth is spacious enough; therefore serve Me only
29|57|Every soul must taste of death, then unto Us shall you return
29|58|Those who believe and act right, We will surely house them in lofty (or upper) chambers of the Garden beneath which rivers flow; to dwell therein secure (or for ever) - an excellent reward for the toilers (workers of good)
29|59|Those who persevere and put their trust in (or rely on) their Lord
29|60|How many a beast cannot carry its own provision! Allah provides for it and for you; He is the Hearer, the Knower
29|61|And if you should ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth, and subjected the sun and the moon?" they will surely say, "Allah!" how then can they turn away
29|62|Allah extends provision to whomsoever He will of His servants, or restricts it; verily, Allah is aware of all things
29|63|And if you should ask them, "Who causes water to come down from the sky and revives therewith the earth after its death?" they will surely say, "Allah!" Say, "And praise be to Allah!" But most of them have no sense
29|64|This life of the world is nothing but a pastime and game (or a sport and a play); but, verily, the abode of the Hereafter, that is life, if they did but knew
29|65|And when they ride in the ship they call upon Allah, making their religion seem sincere to Him; but when He delivers them safely to the shore, behold, they associate others with Him
29|66|Disdaining ungratefully Our gifts; and that they may have some worldly enjoyment: but soon they shall come to know
29|67|Have they not seen that We have made a Safe Sanctuary whilst people are being snatched away around them? Is it then that they believe in falsehood, and disbelieve the bounty of Allah
29|68|But who is more unjust than he who devises against Allah a lie, or rejects the truth when it comes to him? Is there not in hell a home for the disbelievers
29|69|But those who strive in Our cause, We will surely guide them into Our Way, for, verily, Allah is with those who do right
30|1|Alif Lam Mim
30|2|The Romans are vanquished
30|3|In a near land, and they, after being vanquished, shall be victorious
30|4|Within a few years. - Allah´s is the command before and after; and on that day the believers shall rejoice
30|5|With the help of Allah; He helps whom He pleases; and He is the Mighty, the Merciful
30|6|It is Allah´s promise! Allah will not fail His promise, but most of mankind know not
30|7|They know only the outward (appearance) in the life of this world, but of the Hereafter they are heedless
30|8|Do they not reflect within themselves: Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them but with Truth, and for an appointed term (or destined end)? But truly most of the people are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord
30|9|Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than these were in power and prowess, and they dug up the earth, and built on it in greater abundance than these have built. There came to them their me
30|10|Then evil was the end of those who did evil, because they rejected the revelations of Allah and used to mock them
30|11|Allah originates creation, then reproduces it, then to Him will you be returned
30|12|In the Day when the Hour shall come the guilty shall be in despair
30|13|And they shall not have any intercessors from among their gods they have joined with Allah, and they shall be deniers of their associate-gods
30|14|In the Day when the Hour shall come, at that Day they shall be separated
30|15|Then as to those who believed and did good works, they shall be made happy in a Garden
30|16|And as to those who disbelieved and rejected Our revelations and the meeting of the Hereafter, these shall be brought to the chastisement
30|17|Therefore glory be to Allah when you enter the night and when you enter morning
30|18|Unto Him belongs praise in the heavens and the earth, and at the sun´s decline and in the midday
30|19|He brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living, and He revives the earth after its death, and even so shall you be brought forth
30|20|And one of His signs is this, that He created you from dust, then lo! You are mortals, scattered widely
30|21|And one of His signs is this that He created mates for you from yourselves that you may find rest in them, and He put between you love and compassion; herein, indeed, are signs for a people who reflect
30|22|And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your tongues and colours; herein, indeed are signs for the learned (men who have knowledge)
30|23|And one of His signs is your sleeping by night and your seeking of His Bounty (livelihood, benefits and treasures) by day; herein, indeed, are signs for a people who heed (pay attention, are aware or conscious)
30|24|And one of His signs is this, that He shows you the lightning for fear and for hope, and sends down water from the clouds thereby quickens the earth after its death; herein, indeed, are signs for a people who understand
30|25|And one of His signs is this that the heaven and the earth subsist by His command, then when He calls you with a single call, lo! From out of the earth, you emerge
30|26|And His is whoever is in the heavens and the earth; all are obedient to Him
30|27|And He it is Who originates the creation, then reproduces it, and it is easy for Him; and His is the Sublime Similitude (or the most exalted attributes) in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise
30|28|He sets forth to you a similitude (parable) relating to yourselves (and your own experience): Have you among those whom your right hands possess (slaves) partners in what We have given you for sustenance, to share as equals; do you fear them as you fear e
30|29|Nay! Those who are unjust follow their low desires without any knowledge; so who can guide him whom Allah causes to err? And they shall have no helpers
30|30|Then set your purpose for religion as a man upright by nature - the nature made by Allah in which He has made men; there is no altering (the laws of) Allah´s creation; that is the right religion, but most people do not know
30|31|Turning to Him only, and be careful of your duty to Him and keep up prayer and be not of those who ascribe partners to Him (polytheists)
30|32|Of those who split their religion and became schismatic, every sect rejoicing in its own tenets
30|33|And when harm afflicts men, they call upon their Lord, turning to Him, then when He makes them taste of mercy from Him, lo! Some of them begin to associate (others) with their Lord
30|34|So as to be ungrateful for what We have given them; (unto such it is said) "Enjoy yourselves for a while, for you shall soon come to know (the truth)
30|35|Or, have We sent down upon them an authority so that it speaks of that which they associate with Him
30|36|And when We make people taste of mercy they rejoice in it, and if an evil befall them for what their hands have already wrought, lo! They are in despair
30|37|Do they not see that Allah makes ample provision for whom He pleases, or restricts it? Herein, indeed, are signs for a people who believe
30|38|Then give to the near of kin his due, and to the needy and the wayfarer; this is best for those who desire Allah´s countenance (presence, pleasure), and these it is who are successful
30|39|And whatever you lay out as usury, so that it may increase in the property of men, it has no increase with Allah; but that which you give in charity, desiring Allah´s countenance (presence, pleasure) has increase manifold
30|40|Allah is He Who created you, then gave you sustenance, then He causes you to die, then brings you to life. Is there any of your associate-gods who does aught of it? Glory be to Him, and exalted be He above what they associate (with Him)
30|41|Corruption has appeared in the land and the sea on account of what the hands of men have wrought, that He may make them taste a part of that which they have done, so that they may return
30|42|Say: Travel in the land, then see how was the end of those before you; most of them were idolaters
30|43|So set your purpose resolutely to the right religion, before there come from Allah the day which cannot be averted (or is inevitable). On that day they will be sundered
30|44|Whoever disbelieves, must bear the consequences for his disbelief, and whoever does good makes provision for his own soul
30|45|That He may reward those who believe and do good out of His Bounty; surely He loves not the disbelievers
30|46|And one of His signs is this, that He sends forth the winds bearing good news, and that He may make you taste of His mercy, and that the ships may run by His command, and that you may seek of His favour, and that you may be grateful
30|47|Verily We sent before you messengers to their own people. They came to them with clear arguments. Then We gave the punishment to those who were guilty; and helping believers is ever incumbent on Us
30|48|Allah is he Who sends forth the winds so they raise a cloud, then He spreads it forth in the sky as He pleases, and He breaks it up so that you see the rain coming forth from within it; then when He causes it to fall upon whom He pleases of His servants
30|49|Though they were before this, even before it was sent down upon them, in sure despair
30|50|Look then at the signs of Allah´s mercy, how He gives life to the earth after its death; most surely He will raise the dead to life; and He has power over all things
30|51|And if We send a wind and they see it to yellow (scorch the crop), they would after that certainly continue in their disbelief
30|52|For surely you can not make the dead to hear and you can not make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned away (or their backs to flee)
30|53|Nor can you lead away the blind out of their error. you can not make to hear any but those who believe in Our revelations so that they Surrender (in Islam)
30|54|Allah is He Who created you from a state of weakness then He gave strength after weakness, then ordained weakness and grey hair after strength. He creates what He will, and He is the Knower, the Mighty
30|55|And on the day when the Hour shall come, the guilty shall swear that they did not tarry but an hour - thus are they ever deceived
30|56|And those who are given knowledge and faith will say, "Certainly (indeed, in truth) you tarried according to the ordinance of Allah till the Day of Resurrection, so this is the Day of Resurrection, but you were not aware
30|57|But on that day their excuse shall not profit those who were unjust, nor shall they be allowed to make amends
30|58|Verily, We have set forth for men every kind of similitude (parable, example) in this Quran; and, indeed, if you should bring them a miracle, those who disbelieve would certainly say: You are naught but false claimants
30|59|Thus does Allah set a seal on the heart of those who know not
30|60|Therefore be patient; surely the promise of Allah is true and let not those who have no certainty of faith shake your firmness

31|2|These are the verses (revelations) of the Wise Book
31|3|A guidance and a mercy to those who do good
31|4|Those who establish regular prayer and give charity, and who are sure of the Hereafter
31|5|These are in true guidance from their Lord, and these are the Successful
31|6|But amongst men are those who purchase (pay for) idle tales without knowledge (or meaning), to lead astray men from the path of Allah, and to make a jest of it; for them is shameful woe
31|7|And when Our signs are recited to such a one, he turns away in arrogance as though he heard them not, as if there was deafness in both his ears. Announce to him a grievous penalty
31|8|Verily, those who believe and do right, for them are Gardens of Bliss
31|9|Wherein they will abide; it is a promise of Allah in truth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise
31|10|He created the heavens without supports that you can see, and He placed upon the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with you; and He dispersed therein all kinds of beasts; and We send down from the heavens water, and We caused plants of every noble
31|11|This is the Creation of Allah; show me that which others beside Him have created. Nay, the unjust are in obvious error
31|12|Verily, We did give unto Luqman wisdom, saying, "Thank Allah; for he who thanks Allah is only thankful for his own soul; and he who is ungrateful - verily, Allah is Absolute (Independent, Self-sufficient), Owner of all praise
31|13|And (remember) when Luqman said to his son while admonishing him, "O my boy! Associate none with Allah, for, verily, such association is a mighty wrong
31|14|For We have commended his parents to men - his mother bore him with travail upon travail; and it took two years to wean him - "Be thankful to Me and to your parents; for unto Me is the journeying
31|15|But if they strive with you to make you ascribe unto Me partners of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Consort with them in the world with kindness, and follow the way of him who turns repentant unto Me. Then unto Me is your return, an

31|17|O my dear son! Establish worship, and enjoin what is just and forbid iniquity; be patient (constant) whatever befalls you, verily, that is of the steadfast heart of affairs
31|18|And twist not your cheek in scorn towards folk, nor walk haughtily (or insolently) in the land; verily, Allah loves not any arrogant boaster
31|19|But be modest in your bearing and subdue your voice; lo! The harshest of all voices is the voice of the ass
31|20|Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you what is in the heavens and what is in the earth, and has poured down upon you His favours, outwardly and inwardly? But amongst men are those who wrangle about Allah, without knowledge, and without guidance
31|21|And when it is said to them, "Follow what Allah has sent down;" they say, "Nay! We will follow wherein we found our fathers." - What! Even if Satan calls them to the torment of the blaze
31|22|But he who Surrenders his purpose unto Allah (i.e. becomes a Muslim), and does good, he has grasped the firm handle; with Allah rests the issue of all affairs
31|23|But he who disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you; to Us is their return, and We will inform them of what they did; for, verily, Allah is aware of what is in the heart of men
31|24|We will let them enjoy themselves a little; then We will force them to the unrelenting doom
31|25|And if you should ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely say, "Allah." Say, "Praise be to Allah!" but most of them know not
31|26|Unto Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth; verily, Allah, He is the Absolute, the Owner of praise
31|27|And were the trees that are in the earth pens, and the sea ink with seven more seas to swell it, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted; verily, Allah is Mighty, Wise
31|28|Your creation and your rising again are but as that of a single soul; verily, Allah is Hearer, Seer
31|29|Have you not seen that Allah joins the night to the day, and joins the day to the night, and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running unto an appointed time? And that Allah is well informed of what you do
31|30|That is because Allah, He is Truth (or the only Reality), and because what you call on beside Him is the False, and because Allah, He is the Sublime, the Great
31|31|Do you not see that the ship rides on in the sea by the favour of Allah, that He may show you of His wonders? Verily, in that are signs to every grateful heart
31|32|And when a wave like a shadow covers them, they call on Allah, being sincere in their religion; and when He saves them to the shore, then amongst them are some who halt between two opinions. But none denies Our signs save every perfidious disbeliever
31|33|O mankind! Fear (keep your duty to) your Lord and dread the Day when the parent shall not be able to avail the child in aught, nor shall the child avail aught for its parent. Lo! the promise of Allah is true! Say, "Let not the life of this world begu

32|4|Allah is He Who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six Days (periods), and He mounted the Throne (of authority); you have not besides Him any guardian or any intercessor, will you not then remember
32|5|He directs the ordinance (regulates all affairs) from the heaven to the earth; then shall it ascend to Him in a Day the measure of which is a thousand years of what you count
32|6|This is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty the Merciful
32|7|Who made good everything that He has created, and He began the creation of man from dust
32|8|Then He made his progeny of an extract, of a fluid held in low esteem
32|9|Then He fashioned him and breathed into him of His spirit, and made for you the faculties of hearing, and sight and heart; little is it that you give thanks
32|10|And they say: What! When we have become lost in the earth, shall we then certainly be a new creation? Nay! They are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord
32|11|Say: The angel of death who is given charge of you shall cause you to die, then to your Lord you shall be returned
32|12|And could you but see when the guilty shall hang down their heads before their Lord: (saying) "Our Lord! We have seen and we have heard, therefore send us back, we will work righteousness; surely (now) we are certain
32|13|And if We had pleased We would certainly have given to every soul its guidance, but the word (which had gone forth about evil-doers) from Me was just this: "I will certainly fill hell with the jinn and men together
32|14|So taste (the evil of your deeds), because you neglected the meeting of this day of yours; surely We forsake you; and taste the abiding chastisement for what you used to do
32|15|Only they believe in Our revelations who, when they are reminded of them, fall down prostrate (in obeisance) and celebrate the praise of their Lord, and they are not proud
32|16|Their sides draw away from their beds, they call upon their Lord in fear and in hope, and they spend (benevolently) out of what We have given them
32|17|No soul knows what is hidden for them of that which will refresh the eyes (give them joy); a reward for what they did
32|18|Is he then who is a believer like him who is an evil-liver (transgressor)? They are not alike (equal)
32|19|As for those who believe and do good, the Gardens are their homes - a hospitable welcome for what they did
32|20|And as for those who transgress, their abode is the Fire; whenever they desire to go forth from it they shall be brought back into it, and it will be said to them, "Taste the chastisement of the fire which you called a lie

32|22|And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the revelations of his Lord, then he turns away from them? Surely We will requite the guilty
32|23|And certainly We gave the Book to Moses, so be not in doubt concerning the receiving of it, and We made it a guide for the children of Israel
32|24|And We made of them Imams (religious or spiritual leaders) to guide by Our command when they were patient, and they were certain of Our revelations
32|25|Surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ
32|26|Does it not point out to them the right way, how many of the generations, in whose abodes they go about, did We destroy before them? Most surely there are signs in this; will they not then hear
32|27|Do they not see that We drive the water to a land having no herbage, then We bring forth thereby crops of which their cattle and they themselves eat; will they not then see

33|10|When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when the eyes turned dull, and the heart rose up to the throats, and you began to think vain thoughts of Allah
33|11|There the believers were sorely tried and they were shaken with severe shaking
33|12|And when the hypocrites and those in whose heart was a disease began to say, "Allah and His Apostle did not promise us nothing but delusion

33|57|Surely, those who speak evil things of Allah and His Messenger, Allah has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter, and He has prepared for them a humiliating chastisement
33|58|And those who speak evil things of the believing men and the believing women undeservedly, they are guilty indeed of a false accusation and a manifest sin
33|59|O Prophet! Say to your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers that they let down upon them their over-garments (cloaks); this will be more proper, that they may be known, and not be molested; and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful
33|60|If the hypocrites and those in whose heart is a disease and the agitators in the city do not desist, We shall most certainly set you over them, then they shall not be your neighbours in it but for a little while
33|61|Cursed: wherever they are found they shall be seized and slain without mercy
33|62|(Such has been) the course of Allah with respect to those who have gone before; and you shall not find any change in the course of Allah
33|63|Men ask you about the hour; say, "The knowledge of it is only with Allah, and what will make you understand?" - The Hour may be nigh
33|64|Surely Allah has cursed the disbelievers and has prepared for them a blazing Fire
33|65|Wherein they will abide forever (or a long time); they shall find no protecting friend or helper
33|66|On the day when their faces shall be turned back into the fire, they shall say, "O would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger

33|68|O our Lord! Give them a double punishment and curse them with a great curse
33|69|O you who believe! Be not like those who spoke evil things of Moses, but Allah cleared him of what they said, and he was worthy of regard with Allah
33|70|O you who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah and speak straight to the point
33|71|He will put your deeds into a right state (correctly adjust, harmonise, make whole) for you, and forgive you your faults; and whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he indeed achieves a mighty success
33|72|Verily, We offered the trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to undertake it, being afraid of it; but man undertook it. Lo! He has proved a tyrant and a fool
33|73|So Allah will chastise the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, and Allah will turn to (forgive and help) the believing men and women, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful

34|15|Certainly there was a sign for Sheba in their abode; two gardens on the right and the left; (as if to say) "Eat of the provisions of your Lord and give thanks to Him - a good land and an Indulgent Lord
34|16|But they turned away, so We sent upon them a flood from Dams, and We converted their two gardens into two gardens yielding bitter fruit and tamarisk and a few lote-trees
34|17|We requited them with this because they were ungrateful; do We ever punish any but the ungrateful
34|18|And We set between them and the towns which We had blessed, other towns to be easily seen (in prominent positions), and for the journey between then We appointed proportional stages, (saying) "Travel through them secure by nights and days

35|1|All praise is due to Allah, the Originator of the heavens and the earth, the Maker of the angels, messengers flying on wings, two, and three, and four (pairs); He increases in creation what He pleases; surely Allah has power over all things
35|2|Whatever Allah grants to men of His mercy, there is none to withhold it, and what He withholds there is none to send it forth after that, and He is the Mighty, the Wise
35|3|O men! Call to mind the favour of Allah on you; is there any creator besides Allah who gives you sustenance from the heaven and the earth? There is no God but He; whither are you then turned
35|4|And if they call you a liar, truly messengers before you were called liars, and to Allah are all affairs returned
35|5|O men! Surely the promise of Allah is true, therefore let not the life of this world deceive you, and let not the arch deceiver deceive you respecting Allah
35|6|Surely Satan is your enemy, so take him for an enemy; he only invites his party to be inmates of the flaming Fire
35|7|As for those who disbelieve, they shall have a severe punishment, and as for those who believe and do good, they shall have forgiveness and a great reward
35|8|What! Is he whose evil deed is made fair-seeming to him so that he considers it good (other than Satan´s dupe)? Now surely Allah sends astray whom He will and guides aright whom He will, so let not your soul waste away in grief (expire in sighing) f
35|9|And Allah is He Who sends the winds so they raise a cloud, then We drive it on to a dead country, and therewith We give life to the earth after its death; even so is the Resurrection
35|10|Whoever desires power (or honour), then to Allah belongs the power (or honour) wholly. Unto Him do ascend good words, and good deeds does He exalt; and as for those who plan evil deeds, they shall have a severe chastisement; and their plans shall fail

35|16|If He will, He can remove you, and bring, instead a new creation
35|17|And this is not hard for Allah
35|18|And no burdened soul can bear the burden of another and if one weighed down by burden should cry (for help) to another, not aught of it shall be lifted, even though he be near of kin. You warn only those who fear their Lord in secret and keep up prayer; a

35|20|Nor the darkness and the light
35|21|Nor the shade and the heat
35|22|Neither are the living and the dead alike. Surely Allah makes whom He pleases hear, and you cannot make those hear who are in the graves
35|23|You (Muhammad) are naught but a Warner
35|24|Surely We have sent you (Muhammad) with the truth as a bearer of good news and a Warner; and there is not a people but a Warner has gone among them
35|25|And if they call you a liar, so did, indeed, those before them (call their messengers a liar); their Messengers had come to them with clear arguments, and with scriptures, and with the illuminating book
35|26|Then did I punish those who disbelieved, so how intense was My disapproval
35|27|Do you not see that Allah sends down water from the cloud, then We bring forth therewith fruits of various colours; and in the mountains are streaks, white and red, of various hues and (others) intensely black
35|28|And of men and beasts and cattle are likewise of various hues (or species). Only those of His servants who are possessed of knowledge fear Allah alone; surely Allah is Mighty, Forgiving
35|29|Surely they who recite the Book of Allah and keep up prayer and spend out of what We have given them secretly and openly, hope for a gain which will not perish
35|30|That He may pay them back fully their rewards and give them more out of His grace: surely He is Forgiving, Responsive (or Appreciative)
35|31|And that which We have revealed to you of the Book, that is the Truth, confirming (verifying) that which was revealed before it; verily, Allah is Aware, Seer of His servants
35|32|Then We gave the Book for an inheritance to those whom We chose from among Our servants; but of them is he who makes his soul to suffer a loss, and of them is he who takes a middle course, and of them is he who is foremost in deeds of goodness by Allah&ac
35|33|Gardens of Eternity, they shall enter; they shall be made to wear therein bracelets of gold and pearls, and their dress therein shall be silk
35|34|And they shall say: (All) praise is due to Allah, Who has made grief to depart from us; most surely our Lord is Forgiving, Bountiful
35|35|Who has settled (established) us in Mansions of Eternity by His grace; toil touches us not therein, nor can fatigue afflict us
35|36|And as for those who disbelieve, for them is the Fire of hell; it shall not finish them entirely so that they die, nor shall the chastisement thereof be lightened to them: even thus do We recompense every ungrateful one
35|37|And they shall cry therein for succour, "O our Lord! Take us out, we will do good deeds, not the wrong which we used to do." Did We not preserve you alive long enough for him who reflected to reflect? And (also) Warners came to you; therefore ta
35|38|Verily, Allah is the Knower of what is unseen in the heavens and the earth; surely He is Aware of what is in the heart
35|39|He it is Who made you regents (inheritors and vicegerents) in the land; therefore whoever disbelieves, his disbelief is against himself; and their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers with their Lord in anything but hatred; and their disbelief doe

35|41|Surely Allah sustains the heavens and the earth lest they fail (deviate, collapse); and if they should fail, there is none who can uphold them after Him; surely He is the Forbearing, the Forgiving

35|43|(Shown in their) behaving arrogantly in the land and in evil planning; and the evil plans beset none save the authors of it. Then should they wait for anything except the way of the former people? You will not find any alteration in the treatment of Allah

36|1|Ya Seen
36|2|I swear by the Quran full of wisdom
36|3|Most surely you are one of the Messengers
36|4|On a Straight Way
36|5|A revelation of the Mighty, the Merciful
36|6|That you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned, and so they are heedless
36|7|Already has the word proved true of most of them, for they do not believe
36|8|Surely We have placed chains on their necks, and these reach up to their chins, so they are stiff-necked
36|9|And We have made before them a barrier and a barrier behind them, then We have covered them over so that they see not
36|10|And it is alike to them whether you warn them or warn them not: they believe not
36|11|You can only warn him who follows the Reminder (the Quran) and fears the Beneficent Allah in secret; so announce to him forgiveness and an honourable reward
36|12|Surely We give life to the dead, and We write down what they have sent before and their footprints, and We have recorded everything in a Clear Record
36|13|And set out to them a similitude: The ´Companions of the City´, when the messengers came to it
36|14|When We sent to them two, they rejected both of them, then We strengthened (them) with a third, and they said, "Surely we are messengers to you
36|15|They said, "You are naught but mortals like ourselves, nor has the Beneficent Allah revealed anything; you only lie
36|16|They said, "Our Lord knows that we are most surely messengers to you
36|17|And nothing devolves on us but a clear deliverance (of the message)
36|18|They said, "Surely we augur (fear) evil from you; if you do not desist, we will certainly stone you, and there shall certainly afflict you a painful chastisement from us
36|19|They said, "Your evil omen (expectation, foreboding) is with yourselves. What! Is it because you are reminded? Nay, you are a people that transgress all bounds
36|20|And from the remote part of the city there came a man running, he said, "O my people! Follow the messengers
36|21|Follow him who does not ask you for reward, and who are the followers of the right course
36|22|And what reason have I that I should not serve Him Who brought me into existence? And to Him you shall be brought back
36|23|What! Shall I take besides Him gods whose intercession, if the Beneficent Allah should desire to afflict me with harm, shall not avail me aught, nor shall they be able to deliver me
36|24|Then truly I shall manifest (clear, obvious) error
36|25|Verily, I believe in your Lord, therefore hear me
36|26|It was said (unto him), "Enter the garden." He said, "O would that my people knew
36|27|Of that on account of which my Lord has forgiven me and made me of the honoured ones
36|28|And We sent not down upon his people after him any hosts from heaven, nor do We need to send
36|29|It was naught but a single Shout, and lo! They were still and silenced (extinct)
36|30|Alas for the servants! There comes not to them a messenger but they mock at him
36|31|Do they not consider how many of the generations have We destroyed before them, because they do not turn to them (the messengers) (or which return not unto the people)
36|32|And all of them shall surely be brought before Us
36|33|And a sign to them is the dead earth: We give life to it and bring forth from it grain so they eat of it
36|34|And We make therein orchards of palms and grapevines and We make springs to flow forth in it
36|35|that they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands did not make it; will they not then be grateful
36|36|Glory be to Him Who created pairs of all things, of what the earth grows, and of their kind and of what they know not
36|37|And a sign to them is the night: We draw forth from it the day, then lo! They are in the dark
36|38|And the sun runs on to a term appointed for it; that is the ordinance of the Mighty, the Knowing
36|39|And as for the moon, We have ordained for it stages till it becomes again as an old dry palm leaf
36|40|Neither is it allowable to the sun that it should overtake the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day; and all float on in their own orbits
36|41|And a sign to them is that We bear their offspring in the laden vessels (or their race in an ark through the flood)
36|42|And We have created for them the like of it, in which they ride
36|43|And if We please, We can drown them, then there shall be no helper for them, nor shall they be rescued
36|44|Unless by mercy from Us and for enjoyment for a time
36|45|And when it is said to them, "Guard against what is before you and what is behind you, that per chance (or possibly) you may find mercy.... (they are heedless)
36|46|And there comes not to them a sign from among the signs of their Lord but they turn away from it
36|47|And when it is said to them, "Spend of that which Allah has given you", those who disbelieve say to those who believe, "Shall we feed him whom, if Allah please, He could feed? You are in naught but clear error
36|48|And they say, "When will this threat come to pass, if you are truthful
36|49|They wait not for aught but a single Shout (or Blast) which will surprise them while they yet dispute with one another
36|50|So they shall not be able to make a bequest, nor shall they return to their families
36|51|And the trumpet shall be blown, when lo! From their graves they shall hasten on to their Lord
36|52|They shall say, "O woe to us! Who has raised us up from our sleeping-place? This is what the Beneficent Allah promised and the messengers told the truth
36|53|It will be naught but a single Shout (or Blast), when lo! They shall all be brought before Us
36|54|So this day no soul shall be dealt with unjustly in the least; and you shall not be rewarded aught but that which you did
36|55|Surely the Companions of the Garden shall on that day be in happy occupation
36|56|They and their wives (companions) shall be in shades, reclining on thrones of dignity
36|57|They shall have fruits therein, and they shall have whatever they desire
36|58|Peace" - a word from a Merciful Lord
36|59|And get you hence this Day, O guilty ones
36|60|Did I not charge you, O children of Adam! That you should not serve Satan? Verily, he is your open enemy
36|61|And that you should serve only Me; this is the Straight Way
36|62|And he certainly led astray a multitude of people from among you. What! Could you not then understand
36|63|This is the hell of which you were oft warned
36|64|Enter into it this day because you persisted in disbelief
36|65|On that Day We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands shall speak to Us, and their feet shall bear witness of what they earned
36|66|And if We please We would certainly put out their eyes, then they would run about groping for the way, but how should they see
36|67|And if We please We would surely transform them in their place, then they would not be able to go on, nor will they return (after error)
36|68|And whomsoever We cause to live long, We reduce him to an abject state in constitution; do they not then understand
36|69|And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it meet for him; it is nothing but a reminder and a plain (clarifying) Quran
36|70|That it may warn him who would have life, and that the word may prove true against the disbelievers
36|71|Do they not see that We have created cattle for them, out of what Our hands have wrought, so they are their masters
36|72|And We have subjected them to them, so some of them they have to ride upon, and some of them they have for food
36|73|And therein they have advantages and drinks; will they not then be grateful
36|74|And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be helped
36|75|But they shall not be able to assist them, and they shall be a host brought up before them
36|76|Therefore let not their speech grieve you; surely We know what they do in secret and what they do openly
36|77|Does not man see that We have created him from a small seed? Then lo! He is an open disputant
36|78|And he strikes out a likeness for Us and forgets his own creation. Says he, "Who will give life to the bones when they have decomposed
36|79|Say, "He will give life to them Who brought them into existence in the first place, and He is Knower of all (modes of) creation
36|80|He Who has made for you the fire from the green tree, so that with it you kindle (your own fire)
36|81|Is not He Who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Yea! And He is the Creator (of all), the Knower
36|82|His command, when He intends anything, is only to say to it, " Be", and it is
36|83|Therefore glory be to Him in Whose hand is the kingdom of all things, and to Him you shall be brought back
37|1|I swear by those who draw themselves out in ranks
37|2|Then those who drive away (evil or the wicked) with reproof (or strength)
37|3|Then those who recite (proclaim), with mindfulness
37|4|Verily, verily your God is One
37|5|The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and Lord of the Easts (i.e. all the sun´s rising point)
37|6|Surely We have adorned the nearest heaven with an adornment, the stars
37|7|And (there is) a safeguard against every rebellious Satan
37|8|They cannot listen to the exalted assembly and they are thrown at from every side
37|9|Being driven off, and for them is a perpetual chastisement
37|10|Except him who snatches a fragment by stealth, then there follows him a brightly shining flame
37|11|Then ask them whether they are stronger in creation or those (others) whom We have created. Surely We created them of plastic (malleable) clay
37|12|Nay! You wonder while they mock
37|13|And when they are reminded, they mind (heed) not
37|14|And when they see a sign they incite one another to scoff
37|15|And they say, "This is nothing but clear magic
37|16|What! When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then certainly be raised
37|17|Or our fathers of past times (ancestors)
37|18|Say, "Aye! And you shall be abject (humiliated)
37|19|So it shall only be a single Shout, when lo! They shall see
37|20|And they shall say, "O woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment
37|21|(A voice will say,) "This is the Day of the Judgment which you called a lie
37|22|Gather together those who were unjust and their associates, and what they used to worship
37|23|Besides Allah, then lead them to the way to hell
37|24|And stop them, for they must be questioned
37|25|What ails you that you do not help each other
37|26|Nay! On that day they shall be submissive
37|27|And some of them shall advance towards others, questioning each other
37|28|They shall say, "Surely you used to come to us from the right hand side
37|29|They shall say, "Nay, you (yourselves) were not believers
37|30|And we had no authority over you, but you were a wayward people
37|31|So the sentence of our Lord has come to pass against us: we shall surely taste (punishment)
37|32|We led you astray, for we were ourselves erring
37|33|So they shall on that day be sharers in the chastisement one with another
37|34|Surely thus do We deal with the guilty
37|35|Surely they used to behave arrogantly when it was said to them, "There is no God but Allah
37|36|And said, "What! Shall we indeed give up our gods for the sake of a mad poet
37|37|Nay, he has come with the truth and verified the (messages of) the Messengers sent before him
37|38|Most surely you will taste the painful punishment
37|39|And you shall not be punished except for what you did
37|40|Save the servants of Allah, the purified ones
37|41|For them is a determined sustenance
37|42|Fruits, and they shall be highly honoured
37|43|In Gardens of Felicity
37|44|On Thrones (of Dignity), facing each other
37|45|A bowl shall be made to go round them from water running out of clear springs
37|46|Crystal-white, delicious to those who drink
37|47|There shall be no distress in it, nor shall they be exhausted therewith
37|48|And with them shall be those of modest gaze with large beautiful eyes
37|49|As if they were delicate eggs carefully protected
37|50|Then shall some of them turn to others, questioning each other
37|51|A speaker from among them shall say, "Surely I had a comrade on earth
37|52|Who said, ´What! are you indeed of those who bear witness to (the truth)
37|53|´What! When we are dead and have become dust and bones, shall we then, indeed, be brought to judgment?´
37|54|(A voice) Will say, "Will you look down
37|55|Then he looked down and saw him in the midst of hell
37|56|He shall say (to the sceptic), "By Allah! You had almost caused me to perish
37|57|And had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would certainly have been among those brought there
37|58|Is it then true that we shall not die
37|59|Except our previous death? And that we shall not be chastised
37|60|Most surely this is the supreme achievement
37|61|For the like of this then let the workers work
37|62|Is this better as an entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum (having bitter fruit)
37|63|Surely We have made it to be a trial to the unjust
37|64|Surely it is a tree that grows in the bottom of hell
37|65|Its produce is as it were the heads of the serpents (or devils)
37|66|Then verily, they shall eat of it and fill (their) bellies with it
37|67|Then afterwards they shall drink a mixture prepared in boiling water
37|68|Then most surely their return shall be to hell
37|69|Certainly, they found their fathers going astray
37|70|So in their footsteps they hasten on
37|71|And certainly most of the ancients went astray before them
37|72|And certainly We sent among them Warners
37|73|Then see what was the end of those who were warned
37|74|Except the servants of Allah, the purified ones
37|75|And Noah did certainly call upon Us, and the most gracious of Hearer of prayer are We
37|76|And We delivered him and his followers from the mighty distress
37|77|And We made his offspring the survivors
37|78|And We perpetuated to him praise among the later generations
37|79|(This blessing) "Peace and salutation to Noah among the nations
37|80|Thus do We surely reward the doers of good
37|81|Surely he was of Our believing servants
37|82|Then did We drown the others
37|83|And most surely Abraham followed his way
37|84|When he came to his Lord with a whole (sound, pure) heart
37|85|When he said to his father and his people, " What is it that you worship
37|86|Is it lies - gods besides Allah - that you desire
37|87|What is then your idea about the Lord of the Worlds
37|88|Then he looked at the stars, looking up once
37|89|Then he said, "Verily, I am sick (at heart of your worshipping these)
37|90|So they turned their backs and went away
37|91|Then he turned to their gods secretly and said, "What! Do you not eat
37|92|What is the matter with you that you do not speak
37|93|Then he attacked them, smiting them with his right hand
37|94|So they (people) advanced towards him, hastening
37|95|Said he, "Worship you what you yourselves carve out
37|96|When Allah has created you and what you make
37|97|They said, "Build for him a furnace, then cast him into the burning fire
37|98|And they designed a plot against him, but We brought them low
37|99|And he said, "Surely I flee to my lord; He will guide me
37|100|My Lord! Grant me those who do good deeds
37|101|So We gave him the good news of a gentle son
37|102|And when his son was old enough to work with him, he said, "O my son! Surely I have seen in a dream that I should sacrifice you; consider then what do you think." He said. "O my father! Do what you are commanded; if Allah wills, you will fi
37|103|So when they had both Surrendered (unto Allah in Islam) and he threw him down upon his face
37|104|And We called out to him saying, "O Abraham
37|105|You have indeed fulfiled the vision; surely thus do We reward the doers of good
37|106|Most surely this is a manifest trial
37|107|And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice
37|108|And We perpetuated to him among the later generations
37|109|(This blessing) "Peace be on Abraham
37|110|Thus do We reward the doers of good
37|111|Surely he was one of Our believing servants
37|112|And We gave him the good news of Isaac, a prophet among the righteous
37|113|And We showered Our blessings on him and on Isaac; and of their offspring are some who do good, and also some who are clearly unjust to their own souls
37|114|And certainly We conferred a favour on Moses and Aaron
37|115|And We delivered them both and their people from the mighty distress
37|116|And We helped them, so they became the victors
37|117|And We gave them both the Book that clarifies
37|118|And We guided them both on the Straight Way
37|119|And We perpetuated to them among the later generations
37|120|(This blessing) "Peace be on Moses and Aaron
37|121|Even thus do We reward the doers of good
37|122|Surely they were both of Our believing servants
37|123|And Elias was most surely one of those sent
37|124|When he said to his people, "Do you not guard (against evil)
37|125|What! Do you call upon Baal and forsake the best of Creators
37|126|Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your fathers of past times (ancestors)
37|127|But they called him a liar, therefore they shall most surely be brought forth (to the doom)
37|128|But not the servants of Allah, the purified ones
37|129|And We perpetuated to him among the later generations
37|130|(This blessing) "Peace be on Elias
37|131|Even thus do We reward the doers of good
37|132|Surely he was one of Our believing servants
37|133|And Lot was most surely one of those sent
37|134|When We delivered him and his followers, everyone
37|135|Except an old woman who was amongst those who lingered behind
37|136|Then We destroyed the others
37|137|And most surely you pass by their (ruins) in the morning
37|138|And at night; do you not then understand
37|139|And Jonah was most surely of those sent
37|140|When he ran away to a ship completely laden
37|141|Then he drew lots, but was of those rejected
37|142|And the fish swallowed him while he was blameworthy
37|143|But had it not been that he was of those who glorify (Us)
37|144|He would certainly have tarried in its belly to the day when they are raised
37|145|Then We cast him on to the desert shore while he was sick
37|146|And We caused a gourd plant to grow above him
37|147|And We sent him to a hundred thousand folk or more
37|148|And they believed; therefore, We gave them provision for a time
37|149|Now ask them (O Muhammad) has your Lord daughters while they have sons
37|150|Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses
37|151|Verily, it is of their own lies that they say
37|152|Allah has begotten"; and most surely they are liars
37|153|Has He chosen daughters in preference to sons
37|154|What ails you, how is it that you judge
37|155|Will you not then reflect
37|156|Or have you a clear authority
37|157|Then bring your book (writ, record), if you are truthful
37|158|And they assert a relationship between Him and the Jinn; and certainly the Jinn do know that they shall surely be brought forth
37|159|Glory be to Allah from all that they attribute (unto Him)
37|160|But not so the servants of Allah, the purified ones
37|161|So surely you and what you worship
37|162|Cannot lead into temptation anyone against Him
37|163|Save him who will go to hell
37|164|(The angels or those who are ranged in ranks say,) "And there is none of us but has an assigned place
37|165|Verily, we, even we, are they who draw out in ranks
37|166|Verily, we, even we, are they who declare the glory (of Allah)
37|167|And there are those who used to say
37|168|Had we a reminder from those of yore
37|169|We would certainly have been the single-minded servants of Allah
37|170|But (now that it is come) they disbelieve in it; but they will come to know
37|171|And certainly Our word has already gone forth before this unto Our servants sent
37|172|That most surely they shall be helped
37|173|And most surely Our host alone shall be the victorious ones
37|174|Therefore, turn away from them till a time
37|175|And watch, for they will soon come to see
37|176|What! Would they then hasten Our chastisement
37|177|But when it descends on them, evil will then be the morning for those who have been warned
37|178|And turn away from them for a time
37|179|And watch, for they will soon come to see
37|180|Glorified be your Lord, the Lord of Majesty, above all that which they attribute (unto Him)
37|181|And peace be unto those who are sent
37|182|And all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds
38|1|Sad. (I swear) By the Quran, full of Zikr (remembrance in reverence and praising Allah, admonition, reciting, teaching, giving the message)
38|2|Nay! But those who disbelieve are in self-exaltation (pride) and separatism (schism)
38|3|How many generations did We destroy before them, then they cried when there was no longer time to escape
38|4|And they marvel that there has come to them a Warner from among themselves, and the disbelievers say: "This is an enchanter, a liar
38|5|What! Makes he a single God out of the many gods? A strange thing is this, to be sure
38|6|And the leaders among them go about exhorting, "Go and remain constant to your gods; for this is most surely a thing designed against you
38|7|We never heard of this in the former faith; this is nothing but an invention
38|8|Has the reminder been revealed to him alone from among us?" Nay! They are in doubt as to My reminder. Nay! They have not yet tasted My chastisement
38|9|Or is it that they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Mighty, the Bestower
38|10|Or is it that theirs is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them? Then let them ascend by ropes
38|11|But there they shall be put to flight, even as a confederated host
38|12|The people of Noah before them denied the messengers and so did the people of A´ad, and Pharaoh, the Lord of Stakes (of stability)
38|13|And the people of Thamud and the people of Lot and the Companions of the Woods; these were the factions
38|14|There was none of them but denied the messengers, therefore, just was My retribution
38|15|These wait aught but a single Shout, which brooks no delay
38|16|And they say, "Our Lord! Hasten on to us our portion before the Day of Reckoning
38|17|Bear patiently what they say, and remember Our servant David, the possessor of power; surely he was frequent in turning (to Allah)
38|18|Surely We made the mountains sing the glory (of Allah) in unison with him at nightfall and sunrise
38|19|And the birds gathered together; all joined in singing with him
38|20|And We strengthened his kingdom and We gave him wisdom and a clear judgment
38|21|And has there come to you the story of the Disputants (litigants), when they made an entry into the private chamber by ascending over the walls
38|22|When they entered in upon David and he was frightened by them, they said, "Fear not; we are two litigants, of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other, therefore decide between us with justice, and do not act unjustly, and guide us to the righ
38|23|Lo! This is my brother; he has ninety-nine ewes and I have but one; but he said, ´Give to me´, and he has prevailed against me in discourse
38|24|He said, "Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe (to add) to his own ewes. Lo! Many partners act wrongfully towards one another, except those who believe and do good, and very few are they." And David was sure that We had tried h
38|25|Therefore, We rectified for him this lapse, and most surely he had nearness to Us and an excellent journey´s end (return)
38|26|O David! Surely We have made you a Vicegerent in the land; so judge between men with justice and follow not desire, lest it should lead you astray from the path of Allah. Lo! Those who go astray from the path of Allah, they shall surely have a sever
38|27|And We create not the heaven and the earth and that which is between them in vain; that is the opinion of those who disbelieve; then woe to those who disbelieve because of the Fire
38|28|Shall We treat those who believe and do good like the mischief-makers in the earth? Or shall We make those who guard (against evil) like the wicked
38|29|(It is) a Book We have revealed to you abounding in good that they may ponder over its verses, and that those endowed with understanding may reflect
38|30|And We bestowed on David, Solomon, a most excellent servant! Surely he was frequent in turning (to Allah)
38|31|Lo! There were brought to him. in the evening, horses still when standing, swift when running
38|32|And he said, "Surely I have preferred the good things (of the world) over (or because of) the remembrance of my Lord." - until they were taken out of sight behind a veil (or the sun was hidden behind the veil of night)
38|33|(Then he said,) "Bring them back to me"; and he began to slash (or stroke) their legs and necks
38|34|And certainly We tried Solomon, and We put on his throne a mere (soulless) body; then did he repent
38|35|He said, "My Lord! Do you forgive me and grant me a kingdom which (may be) suits not anyone after me; for you are the Bestower of Bounties
38|36|Then We made the wind subservient to him; it made his command to run gently wherever he desired
38|37|And the devils (the unruly), every builder and diver
38|38|And others fettered in chains
38|39|(Saying,) "These are Our Bounties (gift), therefore give freely or withhold, without reckoning
38|40|And most surely he had a nearness to Us and an excellent journey´s end (return)
38|41|And remember Our servant Job, when he called upon his Lord saying, "The devil has afflicted me with distress and torment
38|42|(It was said unto him) "Strike with your foot; here is a cool, refreshing washing-place and a drink
38|43|And We gave him back his people and doubled their number, as a mercy from Us, and as a reminder to those possessed of understanding
38|44|And (It was said,) "Take in your hand a green branch (or grass) and beat her (his rebellious wife gently) with it (rather than with cruelty), and break not your oath. Surely We found him patient; a most excellent servant! Surely he was frequent in tu
38|45|And remember Our servants Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, men of power and vision
38|46|Surely, We purified them with a pure thought, the remembrance of the Home of the Hereafter
38|47|And most surely they were, in Our sight, of the company of the elect, the excellent
38|48|And remember Ishmael and Elisha and Zul-Kifl - all were of the Company of the Good (or Chosen)
38|49|This is a reminder; and most surely there is an excellent destination for those who guard (against evil)
38|50|The Gardens of Eternity, whose doors are opened for them
38|51|Wherein reclining, they call for many fruits and cool drink therein
38|52|And with them shall be those restrained (modest) eyes, companions equal in age
38|53|This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning
38|54|Verily, this in truth is Our provision which will never fail
38|55|This (shall be so for the righteous). And lo! There is an evil destination for the transgressors
38|56|Hell; they will burn in it, an evil resting-place
38|57|This (shall be so); then shall they taste it, boiling and intensely cold
38|58|And other (punishment) of similar kind in pairs (of the two extremes)
38|59|Here is an army plunging in without consideration along with you; no welcome for them; surely they shall burn in the Fire
38|60|They shall say, "Nay! Thee too! No welcome for you: it is you who have brought this upon us; evil is this resting-place
38|61|They shall say, "Our Lord! Whoever prepared it first for us, add you to him a double chastisement in the Fire
38|62|And they shall say, "What ails us that we do not see men whom we used to count among the wicked
38|63|Was it that we took them wrongly in scorn, or have our eyes missed them
38|64|Verily, this is the truth - the mutual wrangling of the inmates of the fire
38|65|Say, "I am only a Warner, and there is no God but Allah, the One, the Absolute (or Supreme and Irresistible)
38|66|The Lord of the heavens and the earth and that which is between them, the Mighty Enforcer, the most Forgiving

38|70|Naught is revealed to me save this, that I am a plain Warner
38|71|Behold, your Lord said to the angels; Surely I am going to create a mortal from dust (or clay)
38|72|So when I have fashioned him in due proportions and breathed into him of My spirit, then fall down making obeisance unto him
38|73|And the angels did obeisance, all of them
38|74|But not Iblis: he was too proud and became one of the disbelievers
38|75|He said, "O Iblis! What prevented you from doing obeisance to him whom I created with My two hands? Are you too proud or are you of the Exalted Ones
38|76|He said, "I am better than he; Thou hast created me of Fire, and him Thou did create of dust (or clay)
38|77|He said, "Then get you hence, for lo! you are outcast
38|78|And surely My curse is on you till the Day of Judgment
38|79|He said, "My Lord! then reprieve me till the day that they are raised
38|80|He said, "Surely you are of the reprieved ones
38|81|Until the Day of the time appointed
38|82|He said, "Then by Thy Might I will surely beguile (tempt them to evil), every one
38|83|Except Thy single-minded servants from among them, the purified ones
38|84|He said, "The Truth Is, and the Truth I speak
38|85|That I will most certainly fill hell with you and with those among them who follow you, every one
38|86|Say (O Muhammad unto mankind), "I do not ask you for any reward for it; nor am I of the impostors
38|87|Lo! It (the Quran) is nothing but a reminder for all peoples (nations)
38|88|And you will, in time, come to know the truth thereof
39|1|The revelation of this Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise
39|2|Surely We have revealed to you the Book with the truth, therefore serve Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience (or making religion pure for Him only)
39|3|Now, surely, sincere obedience (or pure religion) is due to Allah alone and those who take guardians besides Him, say, "We serve them only that they may bring us nearer to Allah". Surely Allah will judge between them in that in which they differ
39|4|If Allah desire to take a son to Himself, He will surely choose those He pleases from what He has created. Glory be to Him: He is Allah, the One, the Absolute
39|5|He has created the heavens and the earth with Truth; He makes the night cover the day and makes the day overtake the night, and He has made the sun and the moon subservient; each one runs on to an assigned term; now surely is He not the Mighty, the great
39|6|He has created you from a single being, then made its mate of the same (kind), and He has made for you eight of the cattle in pairs. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, a creation after a creation, in triple darkness; that is Allah your Lord, His

39|11|Say, "I am commanded that I should worship (serve) Allah, being sincere to Him in obedience (or making religion pure for Him only)
39|12|And I am commanded that I shall be the foremost of those who Surrender (in Islam)
39|13|Say, "I would, if I disobey my Lord, indeed fear the chastisement of a grievous Day
39|14|Say, "Allah (it is Whom) I serve, being sincere to Him in my exclusive devotion
39|15|Serve you what you like besides Him." Say, "The losers surely are those who shall have lost their own souls and their people on the Day of Resurrection; now surely that is the real (or manifest) loss
39|16|They shall have coverings (layers) of fire above them and coverings (layers) beneath them; with this, Allah appals His servants, so be careful of (your duty to) Me, O My servants
39|17|And as for those who put away false gods, lest they should worship them and turn to Allah, they shall have good news. Therefore give good news to My servants
39|18|Those who listen to the Word (or advice) then follow the best (meaning) of it; those are they whom Allah has guided, and those it is who are the men of understanding
39|19|What! Is he against whom the sentence of chastisement is justly due (equal to one who avoids evil): What! Can you save him who is in the Fire
39|20|But those who are careful of (their duty to) their Lord, they shall have high places, above them are built higher places, beneath which rivers flow - (this is) the promise of Allah: Allah will not fail in (His) promise

39|22|What! Is he whose heart Allah has opened to the Surrender (Islam) so that he is in a light from his Lord (like him who is hard-hearted)? Nay, woe to those whose heart are hard against the remembrance of Allah; those are in clear error

39|31|Then lo! On the Day of Resurrection your disputes will be settled before your Lord
39|32|Who is then more unjust than he who utters a lie against Allah and he who gives the lie to the truth when it comes to him; is there not in hell an abode for the disbelievers
39|33|And he who brings the truth and he who accepts it as the truth, these are they that guard (against evil)
39|34|They shall have with their Lord what they please; that is the reward of the doers of good
39|35|So that Allah will do away with the worst of what they did and give them their reward for the best of what they do
39|36|Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? And they seek to frighten you with those besides Him; and whomsoever Allah sends astray, there is no guide for him
39|37|And whom Allah guides, there is none that can lead him astray; is not Allah Mighty, the Lord of Retribution
39|38|And should you ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?", they would most certainly say, "Allah". Say, "Have you then considered that what you call upon besides Allah, would they, if Allah desire to afflict me with harm
39|39|Say: O my people! Work in your manner (or work as and how you can), surely I too am working. But soon you will come to know
39|40|Who it is to whom there shall come a punishment which will disgrace him and to whom will be due an enduring punishment
39|41|Verily, We have revealed to you the Book with the truth for the sake of mankind; so whoever follows the right way, it is for the good of his own soul and whoever errs, he errs only to its injury; and you are not a custodian over them
39|42|Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep; then He withholds those on whom He has passed the decree of death and sends the others back till an appointed term; most surely there are signs in this for a peop
39|43|Or have they taken intercessors besides Allah? Say, "What! Even though they did not ever have control over anything, nor do they understand
39|44|Say, "To Allah belongs all intercession; His is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth, then to Him you shall be brought back
39|45|And when Allah, the One and Only, is mentioned, the heart of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink, and when those besides Him are mentioned, lo! They are joyful

39|48|And the evil (consequences) of what they wrought shall become plain to them, and the very thing they mocked at shall beset them
39|49|Now when harm afflicts a man he calls upon Us; then, when We give him a favour from Us, he says, "I have been given it only by means of knowledge." Nay, it is a trial, but most of them know not
39|50|Those before them did indeed say this, but what they earned availed them not
39|51|But there befell them the evil (consequences) of what they earned; and those who are unjust from among this generation, there shall also befall them the evil (consequences) of what they earn, and they shall not escape
39|52|Do they not know that Allah enlarges the means of subsistence to whom He wills, and He restricts; most surely there are signs in this for a people who believe

39|56|Lest a soul should say, "O woe to me! For what I fell short of my duty to Allah, and I was indeed among the scoffers
39|57|Or should say, "Had Allah guided me, I would certainly have been of those who are dutiful

39|66|Nay! But serve Allah alone and be of the thankful
39|67|And they have not honoured Allah with the honour that is due to Him; and the whole earth shall be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens rolled up in His right hand; Glorified is He, and High Exalted above all that they ascribe as partners
39|68|And the trumpet shall be blown, and all those that are in the heavens and all those that are in the earth shall swoon away (or become unconscious), except such as Allah wills; then it shall be blown again, then lo! They shall stand up waiting

40|4|None dispute concerning the revelations (or Signs) of Allah but those who disbelieve, therefore, let not their strutting in the cities deceive you
40|5|The people of Noah and the parties after them rejected (Prophets) before them, and every nation purposed against their Messengers to destroy him, and they disputed by means of falsehoods that they might thereby render null the truth, therefore I destroyed
40|6|And thus did the word of your Lord prove true against those who disbelieved that they are the inmates of the Fire

40|9|And keep them from evil deeds, and whom Thou keepest from evil deeds this day, Thou hast indeed taken into Thine mercy, and that is the supreme triumph
40|10|Surely those who disbelieve shall be addressed, "Verily, Allah´s abhorrence is more terrible than your abhorrence one to another, when you were called unto the faith and you refused
40|11|They shall say, "Our Lord! Twice didst Thou makest us die, and twice hast Thou givestn us life, so we do confess our faults; is there then a way to get out

40|17|This day every soul shall be rewarded for what it has earned; no injustice (shall be done) this day; Lo! Allah is swift in reckoning
40|18|And warn them of the day that draws near, when heart shall rise up to the throats to choke them; the wrongdoers shall have no compassionate friend nor any intercessor who will be heard
40|19|He knows the stealthy looks and that which the breasts conceal
40|20|Allah judges with truth; but those whom they call upon besides Him cannot judge aught; surely Allah is the Hearer, the Seer
40|21|Have they not travelled in the earth and seen the nature of the consequences for those who disbelieved before them? Mightier than these were they in strength, and in the traces they made in the earth. Yet Allah destroyed them for their sins; and they had
40|22|That was because there came to them their messengers with clear arguments, but they rejected (them), therefore Allah destroyed them; surely He is Strong, Severe in retribution

40|24|To Pharaoh and Haman and Korah, but they said, "A lying sorcerer
40|25|So when he brought to them the truth from Us, they said, "Slay the sons of those who believe with him and keep their women alive." But the plots of unbelievers come to nothing but errors (and delusions)

40|27|And Moses said, "Surely I take refuge with my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant scorner who does not believe in the Day of Reckoning
40|28|And a believing man of Pharaoh´s people who hid his faith said, "What! Will you slay a man because he says, ´My Lord is Allah, and indeed he has brought to you clear arguments from your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him will be (the conse)

40|32|And, O my people! I fear for you the Day of Summoning
40|33|The day on which you will turn back retreating; there shall be no saviour (or defender) for you from Allah, and whomsoever Allah causes to err, there is no guide for him

40|37|The ways and means of access to the heavens that I might look upon the God of Moses, and I surely think him to be a liar. And thus the evil of his deed was made fair-seeming unto Pharaoh, and he was debarred from the Way. The plot of Pharaoh was not to en

40|41|And, O my people! How (strange) is it that I call you to salvation and you call me to the fire
40|42|You call on me that I should disbelieve in (or blaspheme against) Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I call you to the Mighty, the most Forgiving
40|43|Assuredly that to which you call me to has no claim to be called to in this world, nor in the Hereafter, and that our return is to Allah, and the extravagant (or transgressors, those who go beyond the limits) will be inmates of the Fire
40|44|And you will remember what I say unto you, and I entrust my cause to Allah. Verily, Allah is Seer of his servants
40|45|So Allah protected him from the evil of what they planned, and the most evil punishment overtook Pharaoh´s people

40|47|And when they shall contend one with another in the Fire, then the weak shall say to those who were proud, "Surely we were your followers; will you then avert from us a portion of the fire
40|48|Those who were proud shall say, "Surely we are all in it: surely Allah has judged between His servants
40|49|And those who are in the fire shall say to the keepers of Hell, "Call upon your Lord that He may lighten to us one day of this punishment
40|50|They shall say, "Did not your messengers come to you with clear arguments?" They shall say, "Yea." They shall say, "Then pray." But the prayer of those without faith is only futile (wandering in) error
40|51|Most surely We help Our messengers, and those who believe, in the life of this world and on the Day when the witnesses arise
40|52|The day on which their excuse shall not benefit the unjust, and for them is a curse and for them is the abode of misery

40|54|A guidance and a reminder to the men of understanding
40|55|Therefore, be patient; surely the promise of Allah is true; and ask protection for your fault and sing the praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning
40|56|Surely those who dispute about the revelations (signs, communications) of Allah without any authority that has come to them, there is naught in their breasts but (a desire) to become great which they shall never attain. Therefore, seek refuge in Allah, su
40|57|Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of the men, but most of mankind know not
40|58|And the blind and the seeing are not alike, nor those who believe and do good and the evildoer; little is it that you reflect
40|59|Most surely the hour is coming, there is no doubt therein, but most people believe not
40|60|And your Lord has said, "Call upon Me, I will answer you; surely those who are too proud for My service shall soon enter Hell abased
40|61|Allah is He Who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day to see; most surely Allah is Gracious to men, but most men do not give thanks
40|62|That is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of everything; there is no God but He; How then are you perverted (turned or deluded)
40|63|Thus were turned away those who denied the Signs (revelations, communications) of Allah
40|64|Allah is He Who made the earth a resting-place for you and the heaven a canopy, and He formed you, then made goodly your forms, and He provided you with goodly things; that is Allah, your Lord; blessed then is Allah, the Lord of the Worlds
40|65|He is the Living One. There is no God but He, therefore call on (pray to) Him, being sincere to Him in obedience (or making Religion pure for Him or Surrendering to Him in Islam); All praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds

40|69|Have you not seen those who dispute with respect to the Signs (or revelations) of Allah: how are they turned away
40|70|Those who reject the Book and that with which We have sent Our Messenger; but they shall soon come to know
40|71|When the fetters and the chains shall be on their necks; they shall be dragged
40|72|Into boiling water, then in the Fire shall they be burned
40|73|Then shall it be said to them, "Where is that which you used to set up (for worship)
40|74|Besides Allah?" They shall say, "They have failed us. Nay, we used not to pray to anything before." Thus does Allah confound the unbelievers
40|75|(It is said,) "That is because you exulted in the earth unjustly and because you behaved insolently
40|76|Enter the gates of hell to abide therein, evil then is the abode of the scornful (arrogant)
40|77|So be patient (O Muhammad), verily the promise of Allah is true. Whether We let you see part of what We promise them, or whether We cause you to die, to Us shall they be returned
40|78|And certainly We sent messengers before you: there are some of them that We have mentioned to you and there are others whom We have not mentioned to you; and it was not meet for a messenger that he should bring a sign except with Allah´s permission
40|79|Allah is He Who made the cattle for you that you may ride on some of them, and some of them you eat
40|80|And there are many benefits for you in them, and that you may attain through them a want which is in your breasts, and are borne upon them as upon the ships
40|81|And He shows you His signs: which then of Allah´s signs will you deny
40|82|Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them? They were more numerous than these and greater in strength and in the traces they made in the earth, but what they earned availed them not
40|83|Then when their messengers came to them with clear arguments, they exulted in what they had with them of knowledge, and there beset them that which they used to mock
40|84|But when they saw Our punishment, they said, "We believe in Allah alone and we deny what we used to associate with Him
40|85|But their belief could not avail them when they had seen Our punishment; this is Allah´s law, which has indeed held true for His servants, and then the disbelievers perished (or were ruined)

41|5|And they say, "Our heart are under veils from that to which you call us, and there is a deafness in our ears, and a screen hangs between us and you. So do you (as you will), we too are doing (what we will)
41|6|Say (O Muhammad), "I am only a mortal like you; it is revealed to me that your God is one Allah, therefore follow the right way to Him and ask His forgiveness". And woe unto the idolaters (those who join gods with Allah)
41|7|Those who give not regular charity and who deny the Hereafter
41|8|Those who believe and do good, they shall surely have a reward unfailing
41|9|Say, "What! Do you indeed disbelieve in Him Who created the earth in two Days (periods), and do you set up rivals with Him? He (none else) is the Lord of the Worlds
41|10|And He made in it firm mountains rising above its surface, and He blessed the earth and measured therein the sustenance for all things in four Days (periods), alike (or in accordance with their needs) for all seekers
41|11|He directed Himself to the heaven when it was smoke (or gas), so He said unto it and unto the earth, "Come you together (or both), willingly or unwillingly." They both said, " We come in willing obedience
41|12|So He ordained them seven heavens in two periods, and revealed in every heaven its affairs (duties and functions); and We adorned the lower heaven with brilliant stars and made it inviolable (guarded); that is the decree of the Mighty, the Knower
41|13|But if they turn aside, then say: "I have warned you of a scourge like the scourge of A´ad and Thamud
41|14|When their messengers came to them from before them and from behind them, saying, "Serve nothing but Allah", they said, "If our Lord had pleased He would certainly have sent down angels, so we are surely unbelievers in that with which you a
41|15|Then as to A´ad, they were unjustly arrogant in the land, and they said, "Who is mightier in strength than we?" Did they not see that Allah Who created them was mightier than they in strength? But they denied Our Signs
41|16|So We sent on them a furious wind in disastrous days, that We may make them taste the torment of abasement in the life of the world. But verily, the chastisement of the Hereafter is much more shameful, and they shall not be helped
41|17|And as to Thamud, We showed them the right way, but they chose blindness (of heart) above guidance, so there overtook them the stunning (like a bolt of lightening) punishment of humiliation for what they earned
41|18|And We delivered those who believed and did their duty to Allah
41|19|And on the day that the enemies of Allah shall be gathered into the fire, they will be marched in ranks
41|20|Until when they come to it, their ears and their eyes and their skins shall bear witness against them as to what they did
41|21|And they shall say to their skins, "Why have you borne witness against us?" They shall say, "Allah Who gives speech to all things has given us speech, and He Who created you at first, unto Him you are returning
41|22|And you did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should bear witness against you, but you thought that Allah did not know most of what you did
41|23|And that it was your own thought which you entertained about your Lord that have brought you to ruin (or destruction, perdition), so you find yourselves this day among the lost
41|24|Then though they are resigned, still the fire is their abode, and if they ask for favour, yet are they not of those unto whom favour can be shown
41|25|And We have appointed for them comrades (in the world) who made fair-seeming to them what is before them and what is behind them (in their future and their past). And the sentence concerning the nations of jinn and men that have passed away before them is
41|26|And those who disbelieve say, "Do not listen to this Quran and do make a noise in the midst of its reading that you may overcome it
41|27|Therefore, We will certainly make those who disbelieve taste a severe punishment, and We will certainly requite them for the evil deeds they used to do
41|28|That is the reward of the enemies of Allah - the Fire. Therein is their eternal home; the payment for denying Our signs
41|29|And those who disbelieve will say, "Our Lord! Show us those who led us astray from among the jinn and men that we may trample them under our feet so that they may be of the lowest
41|30|As for those who say, "Our Lord is Allah", then continue steadfast in righteousness, the angels descend upon them, saying, "Fear not, nor be grieved, and receive good news of the Garden which you were promised

41|36|And if a whisper (incitement or interference) of the Satan should cause you mischief, then seek refuge in Allah; surely He is the Hearer, the Knower

41|38|But if they are too proud, yet those who are with your Lord glorify Him night and the day, and tire not
41|39|And among His signs is this, that you see the earth barren and desolate, but when We send down on it the rain, it stirs to life and swells into growth: verily He Who gives it life is the Quickener of the dead; surely He has power over all things
41|40|Surely they who distort Our revelations are not hidden from Us. What! Is he, then, who is cast into the Fire better, or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do what you like, surely He is Seer of what you do
41|41|Surely those who disbelieve in the Reminder when it comes to them (are losers, for most surely it is a Book of exalted power)
41|42|Falsehood shall not come to it from before it nor from behind it, a revelation from the Wise, the Owner of Praise
41|43|Naught is said unto you (O Muhammad) but what was said unto the messengers before you; surely your Lord is the Lord of Forgiveness and the Lord of dire Retribution
41|44|And if We had made it a Lecture (Quran) in a foreign tongue, they would certainly have said, "Why have not its verses been explained clearly? What! A foreign (tongue) and an Arab (messenger)!" Say, "It is to those who believe, a guidance an
41|45|And certainly We gave the Book to Moses, but dispute arose therein. Had not a word already gone forth from your Lord, judgment would certainly have been given ere now between them (the disputers); and lo! They are in hopeless doubt about it
41|46|Whoever does good, it is for the good his own soul, and whoever does wrong, it is against it; and your Lord is not in the least unjust (or tyrannical) to His servants
41|47|To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour (of Judgment), and no fruits comes forth from their coverings, nor does a female bear or give birth, but with His knowledge. And on the Day when He shall call unto them, "Where are (those whom you called)

41|49|Man is never tired of praying for good, and if evil touch him, then he is despairing, hopeless
41|50|And verily, if We make him taste mercy from Us after distress that has touched him, he would say, "This is of me, and I do not think the Hour will come to pass, and if I am sent back to my Lord, I shall have with Him sure good." But We will most
41|51|And when We show favour to man, he turns aside and withdraws himself; and when evil touches him, he makes lengthy supplications

41|53|We will soon show them Our signs on the horizons (in the Universe) and within themselves (or their own souls), until it become manifest unto them that it is the truth. Is not your Lord sufficient , since He is Witness over all things
41|54|What! Are they still in doubt about the meeting with their Lord? What! Does He not encompass (surround and penetrate) all things

42|3|Thus does Allah, the Mighty, the Wise, reveal to you, as to those before you
42|4|To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and that is in the earth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great (or the Sublime, the Tremendous)
42|5|The heavens may almost be rent asunder from above them (by His Glory) while the angels sing the praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on earth; verily Allah is the Forgiving, the Merciful
42|6|And as for those who take guardians besides Him, Allah watches over them, and you are not in charge over them
42|7|And thus have We revealed to you an Arabic Lecture (Quran), that you may warn the Mother City (Mecca) and those around it, and that you may give warning of the Day of Gathering wherein is no doubt; when some will be in the Garden and some in the burning F
42|8|And if Allah had willed He would surely have made them a single community, but He makes whom He wills enter into His mercy, and the unjust it is that shall have no guardian or helper
42|9|Or have they taken guardians besides Him? But Allah, He is the Guardian, and He gives life to the dead, and He has power over all things
42|10|And in whatever thing you disagree, the judgment thereof is in the hands of Allah; such is Allah, my Lord, on Him do I trust and to Him do I turn
42|11|The Originator of the heavens and the earth, He made pairs for you from among yourselves, and pairs of the cattle too, multiplying you thereby. There is no thing like unto Him; and He is the Hearer, the Seer
42|12|His are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; He expands or restricts the means of subsistence for whom He wills; verily, He is Aware of all things
42|13|He has ordained for you the religion which He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you (Muhammad) and that which We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying, "Establish religion (obedience) and be not divided therein. Dreadf
42|14|And they did not become divided until after knowledge had come to them out of rivalry among themselves; and had not a Word already gone forth from your Lord for an appointed term, certainly judgment would have been given between them; and those who were m
42|15|Therefore, unto this (scripture) then go on inviting, and be you upright and steadfast as you are commanded, and follow not their vain desires, and say, "I believe in what Allah has revealed of the Book, and I am commanded to do justice between you
42|16|And as for those who dispute about Allah after that obedience has been rendered to Him, their dispute is futile with their Lord, and upon them is wrath, and for them is a terrible penalty
42|17|Allah it is Who revealed the Book with truth, and the Balance, and what shall make you realise that perhaps the Hour be nigh
42|18|Those who do not believe in it would hasten it on, and those who believe are in awe of it, and they know that it is the truth. Now most surely those who dispute obstinately concerning the Hour are in a great error
42|19|Gracious is Allah to His servants; He gives sustenance to whom He pleases, and He is the Strong, the Mighty
42|20|Whoever desires the tilth (means of harvest, gain) of the Hereafter, We will give him increase in it; and whoever desires the tilth (means of harvest, gain) of this world, We give him of it, and in the Hereafter he has no portion
42|21|Or have they partners for Allah who have prescribed for them a religion that Allah permits not? Had it not been for the Word of Decision judgment would have certainly been given between them; but verily the wrong-doers shall have a painful doom
42|22|you see the wrong-doers fearful on account of what they have earned, and it must necessarily befall them; and those who believe and do good shall be in the luxurious meadows of the Gardens; they shall have what they please with their Lord: that is the gr
42|23|That is of which Allah gives the good news to His servants, those who believe and do good deeds. Say (O Muhammad), "I do not ask of you any reward for it but love for my near relatives"; and whoever earns good, We give him more of good therein
42|24|Or do they say, "He has forged a lie against Allah"? But if Allah pleased, He would seal your heart; and Allah will blot out the falsehood and confirm the truth with His words; verily, He is Aware of what is in the breasts
42|25|And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons the evil deeds and He knows all that you do
42|26|And He answers those who believe and do good deeds, and gives increase unto them of His bounty; and as for the unbelievers, they shall have a severe punishment
42|27|And if Allah were to enlarge (increase, improve, enrich) the provision for His servants they would certainly transgress beyond bounds through the earth; but He sends it down in due measure as He pleases; surely He is Aware of, a Seer (Watchful) of His ser
42|28|And He it is Who sends down the saving rain after they have despaired, and He unfolds (scatters) His mercy; and He is the Guardian, the Praiseworthy
42|29|And one of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the living creatures He has spread forth through them; and He has all power to gather them together when He wills
42|30|And whatever affliction befalls you, it is on account of what your hands have wrought, and yet He pardons much
42|31|And you cannot escape in the earth, and you shall not have a guardian or a helper besides Allah
42|32|And among His signs are the ships in the sea, tall as mountains
42|33|If He pleases, He causes the wind to become still so that they lie motionless on its back; most surely there are signs in this for every patient, grateful one
42|34|Or He may make them perish for what they have earned, though He forgives much
42|35|And that those who dispute about Our revelations may know that they have no refuge
42|36|So whatever thing you are given, that is only a provision of the life of this world, and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord
42|37|And those who. shun the great sins and indecencies, and whenever they are angry they forgive
42|38|And those who respond to their Lord and establish prayer, and whose conduct their affairs by mutual consultation, and who spend out of what We have given them
42|39|And those who, when great wrong afflicts them, defend themselves
42|40|And the recompense of evil is punishment like it, but whoever forgives and amends, he shall have his reward from Allah; surely He does not love the unjust
42|41|And whoever defends himself after he has been wronged (or been oppressed), for such there is no blame against them
42|42|The blame is only against those who oppress men and revolt (insolently exceed all bounds) in the earth unjustly; these shall have a painful punishment
42|43|And whoever is patient and forgiving, these most surely are actions of courage and resolution
42|44|And whomsoever Allah makes err, he has no guardian after Him; and you shall see the unjust, when they see the punishment, saying, "Is there any way to return
42|45|And you shall see them brought before it (the Fire) humbled by disgrace, looking with veiled eyes (or furtively). And those who believe shall say, "Surely the true losers are they who have lost themselves and their followers on the Day of Resurrectio
42|46|And they shall have no friends to help them instead of Allah; whomsoever Allah sends astray, for him there is no road
42|47|Hearken to your Lord before there comes the Day from your Lord which there is no averting; you shall have no refuge on that Day, nor shall there be room for denial
42|48|But if they turn away, We have not sent you as a warder over them; yours is only to deliver (the message). Surely when We make man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices there at; and if an evil afflicts them on account of what their hands have already done, th
42|49|Unto Allah belongs the sovereignty (or kingdom) of the heavens and the earth; He creates what He wills; He bestows daughters to whom He will and bestows sons to whom He will
42|50|Or He mingles them, male and female; and He makes barren whom He wills; verily, He is the Knower, Powerful
42|51|And it is not for any mortal that Allah should speak to them unless it be by revelation or from behind a veil, or He sends a messenger to reveal what He will by His leave. Lo, He is Exalted, Wise
42|52|And thus did We reveal to you (Muhammad) an inspired Book by Our command. You did not know what the Book was, nor what the faith was, but We made it a light, guiding thereby whom We will of Our servants; and most surely you guide unto the Straight Way
42|53|The Way of Allah, to Whom belongs whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; now surely to Allah do all affairs eventually come
43|1|Ha Mim. (two mystical letters)
43|2|By the Book that makes things clear
43|3|Surely We have made it an Arabic Lecture (Quran) that you may understand
43|4|And surely it is in the Mother of the Books with Us, truly sublime, full of wisdom
43|5|What! Shall We, then, turn away the Reminder (Quran) from you altogether because you are a wanton (transgressing) people
43|6|And how many a prophet have We sent among the ancients
43|7|And there came not to them a prophet but they mocked at him
43|8|Then We destroyed those who were stronger than these in prowess, and the case of the ancients has gone before them
43|9|And if you should ask them, "Who created the heavens and the earth?" they would most certainly say, "The Mighty, the Knower, has created them
43|10|Yea, He Who made the earth a resting-place for you, and made in it ways for you that you may go aright
43|11|And Who sends down water from the cloud according to a measure, then We raise to life thereby a dead land, even thus shall you be brought forth
43|12|And He Who created pairs of all things, and made for you of the ships and the cattle that you ride on
43|13|That you may firmly sit on their backs, then remember the favour of your Lord when you are firmly seated thereon, and say, "Glory be to Him Who made this subservient to us, for we could not do it by ourselves
43|14|And surely to our Lord we are returning
43|15|And yet they attribute to His servants a share in the Godhead; truly man is ungrateful
43|16|What! Has He taken daughters to Himself out of what He Himself creates and chosen you to have sons
43|17|And when one of them is given news (of the birth) of that of which he sets up as a likeness for the Beneficent Allah (i.e. daughters), his face becomes black and he is full of rage
43|18|What! (Liken they Allah to) that which is bred among ornaments and which in disputes cannot make itself plain (or give an account of itself)
43|19|And they make the angels, who are the servants of the Beneficent Allah, female (divinities). What! Did they witness their creation? Their evidence shall be recorded and they shall be questioned
43|20|And they say, "If the Beneficent Allah had pleased, we should never have worshipped them." They have no knowledge of this; they only lie
43|21|Or have We given them a book before it (the Quran) so that they hold fast to it
43|22|Nay! They say, "We found our fathers in a religion, and surely we are guided by their footsteps
43|23|And even so, We did not send before you (Muhammad) any Warner into any town, but those who led easy lives in it (the wealthy or leisured) said, "Surely we found our fathers in a religion, and surely we will follow in their footsteps
43|24|He (The Warner) said, "What! Even if I bring to you a better guide than that in which you found your fathers?" They said, "Lo! We deny that you are sent (or that with which you are sent)
43|25|So We inflicted retribution on them, then see how was the end of the rejecters
43|26|And when Abraham said to his father and his people, "Surely I am innocent of what you worship
43|27|Save Him Who created me, for surely He will guide me
43|28|And he left it as a word to endure in his posterity that they may return (to Allah)
43|29|Nay! I let them and their fathers enjoy life until there came to them the Truth and a Messenger making things clear
43|30|And when the Truth came to them they said, "This is magic, and lo! We are disbelievers in it
43|31|And they say, "Why was not this Quran revealed to a man of importance in the two towns
43|32|Will they distribute (portion out, administer) the mercy of your Lord? We distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this world, and We have exalted some of them above others in degrees, that some of them may take others in subjection (or take)
43|33|And were it not that all mankind might have become of a single (evil) community (or way of life), We might well have assigned to those who blaspheme against the Beneficent silver for the roofs of their houses and the stairs by which they ascend
43|34|And for the doors of their houses and the couches on which they recline
43|35|And also ornaments of gold. But all this is naught but provision of the life of this world, and the Hereafter with your Lord is only for the righteous (or those who guard against evil)
43|36|And whoever turns himself away from the remembrance of the Beneficent (Allah), We appoint for him a devil (or a Satan), who becomes his comrade
43|37|And most surely they turn them away from the path, and they think that they are guided aright
43|38|Until when he comes to Us, he says (to his devil), "O would that between me and you there were the distance of the two Easts"; evil, indeed, is the companion
43|39|And since you were wrong-doers, it will not profit you this day that you are sharers in the chastisement
43|40|What! Can you (O Muhammad) make the deaf to hear or guide the blind and him who is in clear error
43|41|But if We should take you away, still We shall inflict retribution on them
43|42|Or We will show you that which We have promised them; for surely We are the possessors of full power over them
43|43|Therefore hold fast to that which has been revealed to you; surely you are on the Straight Way
43|44|And most surely it (the Quran) is a Reminder for you and your people, and you shall soon be questioned
43|45|And ask those of Our messengers whom We sent before you: Did We ever appoint gods to be worshipped besides the Beneficent
43|46|And verily We sent Moses with Our revelations to Pharaoh and his chiefs, so he said, "Surely I am the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds
43|47|But when he came to them with Our signs, lo! They laughed at them
43|48|And every sign that We showed them was greater than its predecessor, and We overtook them with chastisement that they may turn (to Us)
43|49|And they said, "O sorcerer! Call on your Lord for our sake, by the covenant He has made with you; we shall surely become followers of the right way
43|50|But when We removed from them the chastisement, lo! They broke the pledge
43|51|And Pharaoh proclaimed amongst his people, saying, "O my people! Is not the sovereignty of Egypt mine? And these rivers which flow beneath me; do you not then see
43|52|Nay! I am surely better than this fellow, who is a contemptible wretch, and who can hardly speak distinctly (or plainly)
43|53|But why have not bracelets of gold been put upon him, or why have there not come with him angels as companions
43|54|So he incited his people to levity and they obeyed him: surely they were a transgressing people
43|55|Then when they displeased Us, We inflicted a retribution on them, so We drowned them every one
43|56|And We made them a precedent and example to the later generations
43|57|And when the example of the son of Mary (Jesus) is given, lo! Your people raise a clamour (of ridicule) there at
43|58|And they say, "Are our gods better, or is he?" They raise not the objection save by way of disputation; nay, they are a contentious people
43|59|He was naught but a servant on whom We bestowed favour, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel
43|60|And if We please, We could make among you angels to be vicegerents (or successors) in the land
43|61|And most surely it is (the above events or the Quran or he, Jesus) is a sign of the knowledge of coming of the Hour (of Resurrection and Judgment), therefore have no doubt about it and follow Me: this is the Straight Way
43|62|And let not the Satan prevent you; surely he is your open enemy
43|63|And when Jesus came with clear arguments he said, "I have come unto you with wisdom, and that I may make clear to you some of that wherein you differ; so be careful of your duty to Allah and obey me
43|64|Surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord, therefore serve Him; this is the right path." (See John10)
43|65|But parties from among them differed, so woe to those who do wrong because of the chastisement of a painful day
43|66|Do they wait for aught but the Hour, that it should come upon them all of a sudden while they perceive not
43|67|The friends shall on that day be enemies one to another, except those who guard (against evil)
43|68|O My servants! There is no fear for you this day, nor shall you grieve
43|69|Those who believed in Our revelations and Surrendered (in Islam)
43|70|Enter you the Garden, you and your wives, rejoicing
43|71|There shall be sent round to them golden plates and cups and therein shall be all that their souls desire, and delights the eyes, and you shall abide therein
43|72|Such will be the Garden which you are given as an inheritance for what you did
43|73|For you therein are abundant fruits of which you shall eat with full satisfaction
43|74|Surely the guilty shall abide in the chastisement of hell
43|75|It shall not be abated from them and they shall despair therein
43|76|It is not We who are unjust to them, but it is they who were unjust to themselves
43|77|And they shall call out, "O Malik! Let your Lord make an end of us." He shall say, "Verily, here you must remain
43|78|Certainly We have brought you the Truth, but most of you are averse to the Truth
43|79|Or have they settled affairs? But it is We who are the Settlers
43|80|Or do they think that We do not hear what they conceal and their secret discourses? Indeed We do, and Our messengers are with them, recording
43|81|Say, "If the Beneficent has a son, I am the foremost of those who serve him
43|82|Glorified be the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne (of Authority), from what they describe
43|83|So leave them flounder in false discourses and sporting until they meet their Day which they are promised
43|84|And He it is Who is God in the heavens and God in the earth; and He is the Wise, the Knower
43|85|And blessed is He Whose is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and with Him is the knowledge of the Hour, and to Him shall you be returned
43|86|And those whom they call upon besides Him have no power of intercession, except he who bears witness unto the Truth with sure knowledge (or they know him -i.e. Muhammad)
43|87|And if you should ask them who created them, they would certainly say, "Allah." Whence are they then turned away
43|88|Consider his (the Prophet´s) cry, "O my Lord! Surely they are a people who do not believe
43|89|So turn away from them and say, "Peace", for they shall soon come to know
44|1|Ha Mim
44|2|By the Book that makes plain
44|3|Lo! We revealed it on a blessed night - Lo! We are ever warning (against evil and its consequences)
44|4|Therein (the blessed night) every wise affair is made clear
44|5|A command from Us; surely We are ever the senders (of revelations)
44|6|As a mercy from your Lord. Surely He is the Hearer, the Knower
44|7|The Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, if you would be sure (in faith)
44|8|There is no God but He; He quickens and causes death, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers
44|9|Nay, but they make sport in doubt
44|10|Therefore, keep waiting for the day when the heaven shall bring evident smoke (or mist)
44|11|That shall overtake men; this is a painful punishment
44|12|(They pray,) "Our Lord! Remove from us the punishment; surely we are believers
44|13|How can they remember (or understand Allah or the message), when a Messenger making clear (the truth) had already come to them
44|14|Butt they had turned their backs on him and said, "He is one taught by others, a madman
44|15|Lo! We remove the punishment a little, (but) you will surely return (to evil)
44|16|On the day when We will seize them with a mighty seizing, We will indeed exact retribution
44|17|And certainly We tried before them the people of Pharaoh, and there came to them a noble Messenger
44|18|Saying, "Deliver to me the servants of Allah; surely I am a trustworthy messenger unto you
44|19|And be not arrogant against Allah, for I come with clear authority
44|20|And surely I have taken refuge with my Lord and your Lord against your stoning me to death
44|21|And if you put no faith in me, then let me go
44|22|Then he called upon his Lord, "These are a guilty people
44|23|(The reply came,) "So go forth with My servants by night; for surely you will be pursued
44|24|And leave the sea divided (as a furrow); surely they are a host that shall be drowned
44|25|How many are the gardens and springs they have left behind
44|26|And corn fields and noble places
44|27|And goodly things wherein they rejoiced
44|28|Thus it was, and We gave them as a heritage to another people
44|29|So the heaven and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they respited
44|30|And certainly We delivered the children of Israel from the abasing chastisement
44|31|From Pharaoh; surely he was haughty, (and) one of those who committed excesses
44|32|And certainly We chose them, knowingly (or purposely), above all the nations
44|33|And We gave them signs wherein was a clear trial
44|34|Lo! These (the pagan Arabs) say
44|35|There is naught but our first death and we shall not be raised again
44|36|Bring back our fathers, if you are truthful
44|37|What! Are they better than the people of Tubba and those before them? We destroyed them, for surely they were guilty
44|38|And We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them in sport
44|39|We create them both not, except with truth, but most of them know not
44|40|Assuredly the Day of Decision (or of Sorting) is the term appointed for all of them
44|41|The day on which friend can in naught avail friend, nor can they be helped
44|42|Save those on whom Allah has mercy; surely He is the Mighty the Merciful
44|43|Behold the tree of Zaqqum
44|44|Is the food of the sinful
44|45|Like molten brass, it shall boil in (their) bellies
44|46|Like the seesing of boiling water
44|47|(It will be said,) "Seize him, then drag him down into the midst of hell
44|48|Then pour above his head of the torment of the boiling water
44|49|Saying, ´Taste; lo! You were forsooth the mighty, the noble
44|50|´Surely this is what you used to doubt!´
44|51|Surely the righteous are in a secure place
44|52|Amidst Gardens and springs
44|53|Attired in fine silk and rich brocade, face to face
44|54|Thus shall it be, and We will join them with Houris (pure and beautiful companions) with wide, lovely eyes
44|55|They shall call in safety therein for every fruit
44|56|They taste not death therein except the first death (i.e. in this physical life), and He will have saved them from the doom of hell
44|57|A grace from your Lord; this is the supreme achievement (or triumph)
44|58|Verily We have made it (the Quran) easy in your tongue that they may be mindful
44|59|Therefore wait (O Muhammad); they too are waiting
45|1|Ha Mim
45|2|The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise
45|3|Most surely in the heavens and the earth there are signs for the believers
45|4|And in your own creation and in what He spreads abroad of animals there are signs for a people that have faith
45|5|And in the variation of the night and the day, and in the sustenance Allah sends down from the clouds, then gives life thereby to the earth after its death, and in the changing of the winds, there are signs for a people who understand
45|6|These are the Signs of Allah which We recite to you with Truth; then in what explanations would they believe after (rejecting) Allah and His Signs
45|7|Woe to every sinful dealer in falsehood
45|8|Who hears the Signs of Allah recited to him, then persists proudly as though he had not heard them; so announce to him a grievous punishment
45|9|And when he comes to know of any of Our revelations, he takes it for a jest; these it is that shall have abasing doom
45|10|Before them is Hell, and there shall not avail them aught of what they earned, nor those whom they took for guardians besides Allah, and they shall have an awful doom
45|11|This is guidance; and as for those who disbelieve in the revelations of their Lord, they shall have a painful penalty because of their abominations
45|12|It is Allah Who has made subservient to you the sea that the ships may run therein by His command, and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may give thanks
45|13|And He has subjected to you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, all from Himself; most surely there are signs in this for a people who reflect
45|14|Tell those who believe that they should forgive those who fear (or hope) not the days of Allah, that He may reward a people for what they earn
45|15|Whoever does good, it is for his own soul, and whoever does evil, it is against it; then you shall be brought back to your Lord
45|16|And certainly We gave the Book and the Wisdom and the Prophecy to the children of Israel, and We gave them of the goodly things, and We made them excel over other nations
45|17|And We gave them clear commandments in (religious) affairs, but they did not differ until after knowledge had come to them, through rivalry among themselves; surely your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they
45|18|And now have We set you on a clear course in (religious) affairs, therefore follow it, and do not follow the low desires of those who know not
45|19|Surely they shall not avail you in the least against Allah; and surely the unjust are friends of each other, and Allah is the guardian of those who guard (against evil)
45|20|These are clear proofs for mankind, and a guidance and a mercy for a people who have sure faith
45|21|What! Do those who have wrought evil deeds think that We will make them like those who believe and do good - that their life and their death shall be equal? Ill is their judgment
45|22|And Allah created the heavens and the earth with Truth and that every soul may be rewarded for what it has earned and they shall not be wronged
45|23|Have you then considered him who takes his vain desire for his God, and Allah has made him err purposely (or knowingly) and has set a seal upon his ear and his heart (understanding) and put a covering upon his eye. Who can then guide him after Allah? Will
45|24|And they say, "There is nothing but our life in this world; we live and die and nothing destroys us but time", and they have no knowledge of that; they only conjecture
45|25|And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, their argument is no other than that they say, "Bring our fathers back if you are truthful
45|26|Say, "Allah gives you life, then He makes you die, then will He gather you to the Day of Resurrection wherein is no doubt", but most people know not
45|27|And Allah´s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; and on the Day when the Hour shall come to pass, on that Day shall those who follow falsehoods (illusions) perish
45|28|And you shall see every people (sect, community or nation) kneeling down; every nation shall be called to its Book (or Record, or will be judged by its scripture): this day shall you be requited for what you did
45|29|This is Our book that speaks against you with truth (or justice); surely We cause to be recorded all what you do
45|30|Then as to those who believed and did good, their Lord will make them enter into His mercy; that is the manifest achievement (or triumph)
45|31|As to those who disbelieved (it will be said,) "What! Were not Our revelations recited unto you? But you were proud and became a guilty people
45|32|And when it was said, "Surely the promise of Allah is true and as for the Hour, there is no doubt about it", you said, "We do not know what the Hour is; we do not think that it will come to pass save a passing thought, and we are not convin
45|33|And the evil consequences of what they did shall become manifest to them and that which they mocked shall encompass them
45|34|And it shall be said, "Today We forsake you as you neglected the meeting of this Day of yours and your abode is the Fire, and there are not for you any helpers
45|35|That is because you took the Signs of Allah for a jest and the life of this world deceived you." So on that Day they shall not be brought forth from it, nor shall they be granted Grace
45|36|Therefore to Allah is due all praise, the Lord of the heavens and the Lord of the earth, the Lord of all worlds
45|37|And unto Him alone belongs Majesty in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise
46|1|Ha Mim
46|2|The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise
46|3|We did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them two save with Truth and for an appointed term; and those who disbelieve turn aside from what they are warned of
46|4|Say, "Have you considered what you call upon besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth, or have they a share in the heavens? Bring me a Book before this or traces of knowledge (confirming this), if you are truthful
46|5|And who is in greater error than he who calls besides Allah upon those that will not answer him till the Day of Resurrection and they are heedless of their call
46|6|And when mankind are gathered together they shall be their enemies, and shall be deniers of having been worshipped
46|7|And when Our clear revelations are recited to them, those who disbelieve say of the truth when it comes to them, "This is mere magic (or sorcery)
46|8|Nay! They say, "He has forged (invented) it." Say, "If I have forged (invented) it, still you do not control anything for me from Allah; He knows best what you utter concerning it; He is enough as a witness between me and you, and He is the
46|9|Say, "I am not the first of (or new thing among) the Messengers, and I do not know what will be done with me or with you: I do not follow anything but that which is revealed to me, and I am nothing but a plain Warner
46|10|Say, "Have you considered :- if it is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies to its similarity with earlier Scriptures, and he believed, while you are inflated with pride; surely Allah does not
46|11|And those who disbelieve say concerning those who believe, "If it had been good, they would not have accepted it ahead of us." And as they do not seek to be rightly directed thereby, they say, "It is an old lie
46|12|And before it the Book of Moses was a guide and a mercy: and this is a Book verifying it in the Arabic language that it may warn those who are unjust and as good news for the doers of good
46|13|Surely those who say, "Our Lord is Allah, then they continue on the right way, they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve
46|14|These are the dwellers of the Garden, abiding therein: a reward for what they did
46|15|And We have enjoined on man kindness (doing of good) to his parents; with trouble did his mother bear him and with trouble did she bring him forth; and the bearing of him and the weaning of him was thirty months; until when he attains his maturity and rea
46|16|These are they from whom We accept the best of what they have done and pass over their evil deeds; (they are) among the dwellers of the Garden; the promise of truth which they were promised
46|17|And he who says to his parents, "Fie on you! Do you threaten me that I shall be brought forth when generations have already passed away before me?" And they both (parents) call for Allah´s aid, (rebuking their son) "Woe to you! Have f
46|18|These are they against whom the word has proved true among nations of the jinn and mankind that have already passed away before them; surely they are losers
46|19|And for all are degrees according to what they did, and that He may pay them back fully their deeds and they shall not be wronged
46|20|And on the Day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the Fire, (it will be said,) "You did squander your good things in the life of the world and you enjoyed them for a while; now this day you shall be rewarded with the punishment of abas
46|21|And mention the brother of A´ad; when he warned his people in the wind-curved sand-hills - and indeed Warners came before him and after him - saying, "Serve none but Allah; surely I fear for you the punishment of a grievous day
46|22|They said, "Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods; then bring upon us that wherewith you threaten us, if you are of the truthful
46|23|He said, "The knowledge is only with Allah, and I deliver to you the message with which I am sent, but I see you are an ignorant people
46|24|So when they saw it (the threat) as a cloud in the sky advancing towards their valleys, they said, "This is a cloud which will give us rain." "Nay! It is (the calamity) which you sought to hasten on, a blast of wind in which is a painful pu
46|25|Destroying everything by the command of its Lord." Then by the morning they became such that naught could be seen except (the ruins of) their dwellings. Thus do We reward the guilty people
46|26|And certainly We had established (empowered, blessed) them in what We have not established (empowered, blessed) you (the Arabs) in, and We had given them (the faculties of) hearing and seeing and feeling, but neither their hearing, nor their seeing, nor t
46|27|And certainly We destroyed the towns which are around you, and We repeat the revelations that they might turn (towards Allah)
46|28|Why did not then those help them whom they took for gods besides Allah to draw them nigh (to Him)? Nay! They were lost to them; and this was their lie and what they forged
46|29|And when We turned towards you (O Muhammad) a party of the jinn listened to the Quran; so when they came in its presence (or influence), they said, "Be silent"; then when it was finished, they turned back to their people warning (them)
46|30|They said, "O our people! We have listened to a Book revealed after Moses verifying that which is before it, guiding to the truth and to a Straight Way
46|31|O our people! Accept the Divine Caller and believe in Him, He will forgive you of your faults and protect you from a painful punishment
46|32|And whoever does not accept the Divine Caller, he shall not escape in the earth and he shall not have guardians besides Him, these wander in manifest error
46|33|See they not that Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and was not tired by their creation, is able to give life to the dead? Aye! He has surely power over all things
46|34|And on the day when those who disbelieve shall be brought before the Fire, (they will be asked,) "Is it not true?" They shall say, "Aye! By our Lord!" He will say, "Then taste the punishment, because you used to deny (the Truth)
46|35|Therefore persevere patiently (O Muhammad) as did the messengers endowed with constancy, and do not seek to hasten for them (their doom). On the day that they shall see what they are promised they shall be as if they had not waited save an hour of the day
47|1|Those who disbelieve and turn away (people) from Allah´s way; He shall render their works ineffective
47|2|And as for those who believe and do good, and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad - and it is the very truth from their Lord - He will remove their evil from them and improve their condition
47|3|That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and because those who believe follow truth from their Lord. Thus Allah makes their similitudes for mankind
47|4|So when you meet in battle those who disbelieve, then smite their necks until when you have overcome them, make them prisoners, and afterwards either set them free as a favour or let them ransom themselves until the war terminates. That is the command. An
47|5|He will guide them and improve their condition
47|6|And cause them to enter the Garden which He has made known to them
47|7|O you who believe! If you help (the cause of) Allah, He will help you and make firm your feet
47|8|And as for those who disbelieve, for them is destruction and He has made their deeds ineffective
47|9|That is because they hated what Allah revealed, so He rendered their actions fruitless
47|10|Have they not then journeyed in the land and seen what was the end of those before them? Allah brought down destruction upon them, and the disbelievers shall have the like of it
47|11|That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, and because the rejecters (unbelievers) have no protector
47|12|Surely Allah will make those who believe and do good enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow; and those who disbelieve enjoy this life and eat even as the beasts eat, and the Fire is their abode
47|13|And how many a town which was far more powerful than your town (Mecca) which has driven you out, did We destroy, so there was no helper for them
47|14|What! Is he who has a clear argument (or relies on clear proof) from his Lord like him to whom the evil of his work is made fair-seeming when they follow their own lusts (or low desires)
47|15|A similitude of the Garden which those guarding their duty (to Allah against evil) are promised: therein are rivers of water unpolluted (or incorruptible), and rivers of milk the taste whereof never changes, and rivers of wine delicious to those who drink
47|16|And there are those of them who seek to listen to you, until when they go forth from you, they say to those who have been given the knowledge, "What was it that he said just now?" These are they upon whose heart Allah has set a seal and they fol
47|17|And as for those who follow the right direction, He increases them in guidance and bestows on them their piety and restraint (against evil)
47|18|Do they then wait for aught but the Hour that it should come to them of a sudden? But already have come some tokens of it, but how can they take warning when it comes on them
47|19|So know that there is no God but Allah, and, ask protection for your fault and for the believing men and the believing women; and Allah knows the place of your returning and the place of your abiding (or how you move about and how you live)
47|20|And those who believe say, "Why has not a chapter been revealed?" But when a decisive chapter is revealed, and fighting is mentioned therein, you see those in whose heart is a disease look at you with the look of one fainting because of (fear or)
47|21|Obedience and just (or civil, appropriate) words would be proper; but when the affair becomes settled, then if they remain true to Allah it would certainly be better for them
47|22|But if you held command, would you make mischief in the land and cut off the ties of kinship
47|23|These it is whom Allah has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes
47|24|Do they not then meditate on the Quran or are there locks on the heart
47|25|Surely those who turn their backs after guidance has become manifest to them, Satan has seduced them, and He gives them reign (or Satan gives them false hopes)
47|26|That is because they say to those who hate what Allah has revealed, "We will obey you in only some matters." and Allah knows their secrets
47|27|But how will it be when the angels take their souls in death and smite their faces and their backs
47|28|That is because they follow what is displeasing to Allah and are averse to His pleasure, therefore, He has made null their deeds
47|29|Or do those in whose heart is a disease think that Allah will not bring forth their secret faults
47|30|And if We willed We could have made you (Muhammad) know them so that you would certainly have recognised them by their marks. And you shall certainly recognize them by the intent (tone) of their speech; and Allah knows your deeds
47|31|And most certainly We will try you until We have tested those among you who strive hard, and the steadfast, and made your case manifest
47|32|Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah´s way and oppose the Messenger after that guidance has become clear to them cannot harm Allah in any way, and He will make null their deeds
47|33|O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Apostle, and do not make your actions vain
47|34|Surely those who disbelieve and turn away from Allah´s way, then they die while they are disbelievers, Allah will by no means forgive them
47|35|And be not faint-hearted, crying for peace, when you should be uppermost, and Allah is with you, and He will not bring your deeds to naught
47|36|The life of this world is only idle sport and pastime, and if you believe and guard (against evil) He will give you your wages, and will not ask of you your possessions
47|37|If He should ask you for it and urge you, you will be niggardly, and He will bring forth your ill feelings
47|38|Behold! You are those who are called upon to spend in Allah´s way, but among you are those who are niggardly (or hoard), and whoever is niggardly is niggardly against his own soul; and Allah is the Rich (Self-sufficient) and you are the poor (having)
48|1|Surely We have given to you a clear victory
48|2|That Allah may forgive your community their past faults and those to come, and complete His favour to you and keep you on a Straight Way
48|3|And that Allah might help you with powerful help
48|4|He it is Who sent down tranquillity into the heart of the believers that they might have more of faith added to their faith - for Allah´s are the hosts (forces) of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is Knowing, Wise
48|5|That He may cause the believing men and the believing women to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow to abide therein, and remove from them their evil; and that, in the sight of Allah, is the supreme achievement (or triumph)
48|6|And that He may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who entertain evil thoughts about Allah. For them is the evil turn of fortune, and Allah is wroth with them and has cursed them and pr
48|7|Allah´s are the hosts (or forces) of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Mighty, Wise
48|8|Surely We have sent you (O Muhammad) as a witness and as a bearer of good news and as a Warner
48|9|That you (mankind) may believe in Allah and His Messenger and may aid Him and revere Him; and that you may declare His glory, morning and evening
48|10|Surely those who swear allegiance unto you (O Muhammad) do but swear allegiance to Allah; the hand of Allah is above their hands. Therefore, whoever breaks his faith, he breaks it only to the injury of his own soul, and whoever fulfils what he has covenan
48|11|Those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind will say to you, "Our property and our families kept us busy, so ask forgiveness for us." They say with their tongues what is not in their heart. Say, "Then who can control anything f
48|12|Nay! You rather thought that the messenger and the believers would not ever return to their families, and this was made fair-seeming to your heart, and you thought an evil thought and you were a worthless people
48|13|And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger - Lo! We have prepared a blazing Fire for the disbelievers
48|14|And Allah´s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth; He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful
48|15|Those who are left behind will say when you set forth to capture booty, "Allow us to follow you." They fain would change the verdict of Allah. Say, "By no means shall you follow us; thus did Allah say before." But they will say
48|16|Say to those of the dwellers of the desert who were left behind: "You shall soon be invited to fight against a people possessing mighty prowess; you will fight against them or they will submit; then if you obey, Allah will grant you a good reward; an
48|17|There is no blame for the blind, nor is there any blame for the lame, nor is there any blame for the sick if they do not go forth to war; and whoever obeys Allah and His Apostle, He will cause him to enter Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and whoever tu
48|18|Certainly Allah´s Good Pleasure was on the believers when they swore allegiance unto you under the tree, and He knew what was in their heart, so He sent down peace (or tranquillity) on them and rewarded them with a near victory
48|19|And many gains which they will acquire; and Allah is Mighty, Wise
48|20|Allah promised you many gains which you will acquire, then He has given you this one as a foretaste and restrained the hands of men from you, that it may be a sign for the believers and that He may guide you on a Straight Way
48|21|And other gains which are not yet within your power (or have not been able to achieve), Allah will encompassed them, and Allah has power over all things
48|22|And if those who disbelieve fight with you, they would certainly turn their backs, then they would not find any protector or helper
48|23|Such has been the course (or practice or law) of Allah that has indeed run also in the past, and you shall find no power to change this course (or law) of Allah
48|24|And He it is Who held back their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had given you victory over them; and Allah is Seeing what you do
48|25|It is they who disbelieved and turned you away from the Sacred Mosque and prevented the offering from reaching its destined place. Were it not for the believing men and the believing women (in Mecca), whom you knew not that you were trampling, thereby inc
48|26|When those who disbelieved harboured in their heart feelings of agitation and disdain - the agitation and disdain of the Days of Ignorance - Allah sent down His tranquillity on His Messenger and on the believers, and made them adhere to the Word (or comma)
48|27|Truly Allah had shown to His Messenger the vision: you shall most certainly enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah wills, in security, some with shaved heads and others with cut hair, fearless. But He knows what you do not know, and He has given you a near vic
48|28|He it is Who sent His Messenger with the guidance and the true religion that He may make it prevail over all the religions; and Allah is enough for a witness
48|29|Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those with him are firm of heart against the unbelievers, compassionate among themselves; you will see them bowing down, prostrating themselves, seeking grace from Allah and His Good Pleasure; their marks are in the
49|1|O you who believe! Be not forward in the presence of Allah and His Apostle, and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; surely Allah is Hearing, Knowing
49|2|O you who believe! Do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet, and do not speak loud to him as you speak loud to one another, lest your deeds became null while you do not perceive
49|3|Surely those who lower their voices before Allah´s Messenger are they whose heart Allah has proved for righteousness (or guarding against evil); they shall have forgiveness and a great reward
49|4|As for those who call out to you from behind the private apartments, surely most of them understand not
49|5|And if they wait patiently until you come out to them, it would certainly be better for them, and Allah is Forgiving, Merciful
49|6|O you who believe! If an evil-doer comes to you with a report, look carefully into it (do not ignore it because he is evil), lest you harm a people in ignorance, then be sorry for what you have done
49|7|And know that among you is Allah´s Messenger; should he obey you in many a matter, you would surely fall into distress, but Allah has endeared the faith to you and has made it seemly in your heart, and He has made hateful to you disbelief and transg
49|8|It is a grace and a favour from Allah; and Allah is Knowing, Wise
49|9|And if two parties of the believers quarrel, make peace between them; but if one of them transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then fight you all against the one which transgresses until it returns to the commands of Allah; then if it returns, mak
49|10|The believers are naught else but brethren, therefore make peace between your brethren and be careful of your duty to Allah that mercy may be had on you
49|11|O you who believe! Let not one people deride (or ridicule) another people perchance they may be better than they, nor let women deride other women, perchance they may be better than they; and do not find fault with (or defame) your own people nor insult o
49|12|O you who believe! Avoid most of suspicion, for surely suspicion in some cases is a sin, and do not spy nor let some of you backbite others. Does one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? But you abhor it; and be careful of (your duty to) Alla
49|13|O mankind! Surely We have created you male and female (or from a single pair), and made you tribes and families that you may know each other; surely the most noble of you with Allah is the one among you most righteous (careful of his duty to Allah); surel
49|14|The dwellers of the desert (or desert Arabs) say, "We believe". Say, "You believe not, but rather say, ´We submit´; for faith has not yet entered into your heart; and if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not diminish aug
49|15|Only they are the believers who believe in Allah and His Messenger, then afterwards they doubt not and struggle hard with their wealth and their lives in the way of Allah; they are the truthful (sincere or righteous) ones
49|16|Say, "What! Will you teach Allah about your religion?" Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is in the earth; and Allah is Aware of all things
49|17|They think that they do you (Muhammad) a favour by their Surrender (by becoming Muslims). Say, "Deem not your Surrender (Islam) a favour unto me; nay, It is Allah who has conferred a favour unto you, in as much as He has led you to the Faith, if you
49|18|Lo! Allah knows the unseen things of the heavens and the earth; and Allah is Seer of what you do
50|1|Qaf. I swear by the glorious Quran (that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah)
50|2|Nay! They wonder that there has come to them a Warner from among themselves, so the unbelievers say, " This is a wonderful thing
50|3|What! When we are dead and have become dust (shall we live again)? That is a far return (or far from probable or from our understanding)
50|4|We know indeed what the earth diminishes (or takes) from them (excreta or dead bodies), and with Us is a Preserved Record (or the record is preserved)
50|5|Nay, they rejected the truth when it came to them, so they are now in a state of confusion
50|6|Do they not then look up to heaven above them how We have made it and adorned it and it has no gaps (rifts or flaws)
50|7|And the earth, We have made it plain and cast in it mountains and We have made to grow therein of all beautiful kinds
50|8|As a vision (observation or spectacle) and a reminder to every penitent servant (for his delight or awe and instruction)
50|9|And We send down from the cloud water abounding in good (or blessings), then We cause to grow therewith gardens and the grain that is reaped
50|10|And the lofty palm-trees with fruit spikes closely set one above another
50|11|A sustenance for the servants (of Allah), and We give life thereby to a dead land; thus is the Resurrection
50|12|Others before them rejected (these ideas or the Prophets): the people of Noah and the dwellers of Ar-Rass and Thamud
50|13|And A´ad and Pharaoh and Lot´s brethren
50|14|And the dwellers of the Wood (Midian) and the people of Tubba; all rejected the messengers. Therefore, My threat came to pass
50|15|Were We then fatigued with (did We need rest after) the first creation? Yet are they in doubt with regard to a new creation
50|16|And certainly We created man, and We know what his soul suggests to him, and We are nearer to him than his life-vein (Jugular and Carotid)
50|17|When the two Receivers receive him, sitting on the right and on the left
50|18|He utters not a word but there is by him a watcher (sentinel, one who censors) at hand
50|19|And the stupor of death will bring truth; that is what you were trying to escape
50|20|And the Trumpet shall be blown; that is the day about which warning had been given
50|21|And every soul shall come, with it a Driver and a Witness
50|22|Certainly you were heedless of it, but now We have removed from you your veil, and piercing is your sight this day
50|23|And his companions (the Driver and the Witness) shall say, "Here (his Record) is ready with me
50|24|So cast into Hell every ungrateful, rebellious one
50|25|Forbidder of good, exceeder of limits, doubter
50|26|Who sets up another God with Allah; cast him into severe chastisement
50|27|His companion will say, "Our Lord! I did not lead him into transgression but he himself was in great error
50|28|He will say, "Do not quarrel in My presence, and indeed I gave you the warning beforehand
50|29|My word shall not be changed, nor am I in the least unjust to My servants
50|30|On the day that We will say to Hell, "Are you filled up?" And it will say, "Are there any more
50|31|And the Garden shall be brought near to those who guard against evil, not far off
50|32|This is what you were promised, (it is) for every one who turned (to Allah or was repentant), and kept His limits (or Law)
50|33|Who fears the Beneficent One in secret (or unseen or inwardly) and comes with a penitent (or devoted) heart
50|34|Enter you therein in peace, this is the day of Eternal Life (or Immortality)
50|35|They have therein all that they wish and with Us is even more
50|36|And how many a generation did We destroy before them who were mightier in prowess than they. Then they wander through (or overrun) the land; but was there for them a place of refuge (when the Judgment came)
50|37|Most surely there is a reminder in this for him who has a heart or he gives ear and is a witness (or understands intelligently)
50|38|And certainly We created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six periods and there touched Us not any fatigue (Allah required no rest)
50|39|Therefore be patient of what they say, and sing the praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting
50|40|And glorify Him in the night and after the prescribed prostrations
50|41|And listen for the Day when the Caller shall cry from a near place
50|42|The Day when they shall hear the Call (or Cry or Blast) in truth; that is the day of coming forth
50|43|Surely We give life and cause to die, and to Us is the final destination (or goal)
50|44|The day on which the earth shall be rent asunder from under them, they will hasten forth; that will be a gathering together easy to Us
50|45|We know best what they say, and you (O Muhammad) are not one to compel them; but admonish by means of the Quran him who fears My warning
51|1|(I swear) By the wind that scatters far and wide
51|2|And those that lift and bear heavy loads
51|3|And those that flow with ease and gentleness
51|4|And those that distribute and apportion by Our command
51|5|That of which you are warned is most surely true
51|6|And the judgment must most surely come about
51|7|Swear by the heaven (sky) full of paths (orbits)
51|8|Most surely you are in doctrines (opinions, teachings, ideologies) discordant (or inconsistent or contradictory)
51|9|He is turned away by them from truth, who would be (or wishes to be) turned away
51|10|Cursed be the conjecturers (or lie-mongers)
51|11|Who flounder heedless in an abyss (of ignorance and confusion)
51|12|They ask, "When will be the day of judgment
51|13|It is the day on which they shall be tried at the Fire
51|14|Taste you your torment! This is what you sought to hasten
51|15|Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in Gardens and Springs
51|16|Taking joy in what their Lord gives them; surely they were before that, the doers of good
51|17|They used to sleep but little in the night
51|18|And in the morning they prayed for forgiveness
51|19|And in their wealth a portion was allotted for him who asked (the needy) and to him who was denied (the outcast, the deprived person or the one who could not ask)
51|20|And in the earth there are signs for those who have sure faith
51|21|And also in your own souls; will you not then see
51|22|And in the heaven is your sustenance and that which you are promised
51|23|And by the Lord of the heavens and the earth! It is most surely the truth, even as you speak
51|24|Has there come to you information about the honoured guests of Abraham
51|25|When they entered his presence they said, "Peace. Peace." Said he, "What a strange people
51|26|Then he turned aside to his family secretly and brought a fat (roasted) calf
51|27|And placed it before them. He said, "What! Will you not eat
51|28|(When they did not eat) he conceived in his mind a fear of them. They said, "Fear not." And they gave him the good news of a son endowed with knowledge
51|29|Then his wife came up in great grief, and she struck her face and said, "An old barren woman
51|30|They said, "Thus says your Lord: Surely He is the Wise, the Knowing
51|31|He said, "What is your errand then, O Messengers
51|32|They said, "Surely we are sent to a guilty people
51|33|That we may send down upon them stone of clay (or brimstones)
51|34|Sent forth from your Lord for the extravagant (those who transgress beyond bounds)
51|35|Then We brought forth such believers as were therein
51|36|But We found not therein but one house of those who had Surrendered (Muslims)
51|37|And We left therein a sign for those who fear the grievous penalty
51|38|And in Moses (was another sign). When We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority
51|39|But he turned away with his forces and said, "A sorcerer or a mad man
51|40|So We seized him and his hosts and hurled them into the sea and his was the blame
51|41|And in A´ad (was another sign). When We sent upon them the destructive wind
51|42|It spared naught on which it blew, but made it like dust
51|43|And in Thamud (was another sign). When it was said to them, "Enjoy yourselves for a while
51|44|But they revolted against the commandment of their Lord, so the rumbling (thunderbolt or stunning noise of an earthquake) overtook them while they looked
51|45|And they were not able to rise up, nor could they defend themselves
51|46|And the people of Noah (were also a sign) before that, surely they were a transgressing people
51|47|And the heaven, We raised it high with power, and it is We that expand the vastness of space (or We are the expanders of it)
51|48|And the earth, We have spread it out; how gracious was the Spreader thereof
51|49|And of all things have We created pairs, that you may reflect (or receive instruction)
51|50|Therefore flee unto Allah, surely I am a plain Warner to you from Him
51|51|And set not up with Allah another God: surely I am a plain Warner to you from Him
51|52|Thus there did not come to those before them a messenger but they said, "(He is) A sorcerer or a mad man
51|53|Is this the legacy (or tradition) they have transmitted to each other? Nay! They are a people extravagant (transgressing beyond bounds)
51|54|Then turn your back upon them for you are not to blame
51|55|And continue to teach (or remind), for surely the reminder profits the believers
51|56|And I have not created the jinn and mankind except to worship (serve) Me
51|57|No sustenance do I require from them, nor do I require that they should feed Me
51|58|Surely it is Allah Who is the Bestower of sustenance, the Lord of Power, the ever Steadfast
51|59|And lo! Those who do wrong shall have a portion like the portion of those of earlier generations, therefore let them not ask Me to hasten
51|60|Woe to those who disbelieve because of their Day which they are promised
52|1|(I swear) By the Mount
52|2|By a Decree inscribed
52|3|On a fine parchment, unrolled
52|4|And the much visited House
52|5|And the canopy exalted
52|6|And the swollen sea
52|7|Most surely the doom of your Lord will come to pass
52|8|There shall be none to avert it
52|9|On the day when the heaven shall heave with awful commotion
52|10|And the mountains shall move with awful movement
52|11|Then woe on that Day unto the deniers (of the truth)
52|12|Those who sport in vain discourses
52|13|The Day on which they shall be driven irresistibly to the Fire of Hell
52|14|This is the Fire which you used to deny
52|15|Is it magic then, or do you not see
52|16|Burn you therein, and whether you bear it patiently or not, it makes no difference; you shall be requited only what you did
52|17|Surely those who guard (against evil) shall be in Gardens of Bliss
52|18|Rejoicing because of what their Lord gave them, and their Lord saved them from the punishment of the burning Fire
52|19|Eat and drink with profit and health because of what you did
52|20|Reclining on thrones set in ranks, and We will unite them to large-eyed beautiful ones (Houri)
52|21|And as for those who believe and whose offspring follow them in faith, We will unite with them their offspring and We will not deprive them of naught of their work; each individual is a pledge for his own deeds
52|22|And We will provide them with fruit and flesh such as they desire
52|23|They shall pass from one to another a cup wherein there shall be nothing vain nor any sin
52|24|And round them shall serve youth devoted to them, handsome as well-guarded (preserved or hidden) pearls
52|25|And some of them shall draw near unto others, inquiring
52|26|Saying, "Surely in the past we feared for our families
52|27|But Allah has been gracious to us and He has saved us from the punishment of the Scorching Wind
52|28|Surely we called upon Him before: Surely He is the Benign, the Merciful
52|29|Therefore continue you (O Muhammad) to remind (or warn), for by the grace of your Lord, you are not a soothsayer, or a madman
52|30|Or do they say, " (he is) A poet, for whom we await a calamity of (or an accident of or caused by) time
52|31|Say, "Wait (expect) ye! I too with you am waiting (expecting)
52|32|Nay! Do their understandings bid them this? Or are they a people transgressing beyond bounds
52|33|Or do they say, "He has forged it." Nay! They will not believe
52|34|Then let them bring an announcement (or recital) like it if they are truthful
52|35|Or were they created out of nothing, or are they themselves the creators
52|36|Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Nay! They have no certainty
52|37|Or have they the treasures of your Lord with them? Or have they been set in absolute authority
52|38|Or have they a ladder (unto heaven) the means by which they listen? Then let their listener bring a clear authority
52|39|Or has He daughters while you have sons
52|40|Or do you ask them for a reward, so that they are overburdened by a debt
52|41|Or have they the unseen so that they write it down
52|42|Or do they desire to plot (or ensnare)? But those who disbelieve shall be the vanquished in their plot
52|43|Or have they a God other than Allah? Glory be to Allah from what they set up (with Him)
52|44|And if they should see a portion of the heaven coming down, they would say, "Piled up clouds
52|45|Leave them then till they meet that Day of theirs wherein they shall be made to swoon (with terror)
52|46|The day on which their struggle shall not avail them aught, nor shall they be helped
52|47|And surely those who are unjust shall have a punishment besides that (in the world), but most of them understand not
52|48|And wait patiently for the decree (command, judgment) of your Lord, for verily you are in Our eyes; and hymn the praise of your Lord when you rise
52|49|And in the night, give Him glory too, and at the retreat of the stars
53|1|(I swear) By the star when it sets
53|2|Your companion (Muhammad) does not err, nor is he deceived (or astray or is misled)
53|3|Nor does he speak out of (his own) desire
53|4|It (the Quran) is naught but revelation that is inspired (sent down to him)
53|5|Taught by one of mighty power, (The Archangel Gabriel)
53|6|Endowed with wisdom; for he appeared in clear vision
53|7|While he was in the highest part of the horizon
53|8|Then he drew near, and descended
53|9|Until he was two bows distant or closer still
53|10|And He revealed to His servant what He revealed
53|11|The heart (of the Prophet) lied not in (making him see) what he saw
53|12|What! Do you then dispute with him as to what he saw
53|13|And certainly he saw him in another descent
53|14|At the Lote-tree of the furthest boundary
53|15|Near which is the Garden of Abode (or Presence)
53|16|When that which shrouds (in mystery) covered the Lote-tree
53|17|The eye did not swerve, nor did it exceed the limit (or was over bold or went wrong)
53|18|Certainly he saw of the Greatest Signs of his Lord
53|19|Have you seen Lat and Uzza
53|20|And Manat, the third, the last
53|21|What! For you the males and for Him the females
53|22|This indeed is an unjust division
53|23|They are naught but names which you have named, you and your fathers; Allah has not sent for them any authority. They follow naught but conjecture and the low desires which their souls incline to, even though true guidance has come to them from their Lord
53|24|Or shall man have whatever whims he wishes
53|25|Nay! To Allah belongs the after and the former life (or the End and the Beginning)
53|26|And how many so ever angels are in the heavens, their intercession does not avail at all except after Allah has given permission to whom He wills and chooses to accept
53|27|Most surely they who do not believe in the Hereafter name the angels with female names
53|28|And they have no knowledge of it; they do not follow anything but conjecture, and surely conjecture does not avail against the truth at all
53|29|Therefore, turn aside from him who turns his back upon Our reminder (or remembrance) and does not desire anything but the life of this world
53|30|That is their sum of knowledge; surely your Lord knows best him who goes astray from His path and He knows best him who follows the right direction
53|31|And to Allah belongs that which is in the heavens and that which is in the earth, that He may reward those who do evil according to what they do, and that He may reward those who do good with goodness
53|32|Those who keep aloof from the great sins and the indecencies, except the passing idea (or the unwilling or small offence); surely your Lord is liberal in forgiving. He knows you best when He brings you forth from the earth and when you are embryos in the
53|33|Have you then seen him who turns his back
53|34|And gives a little and then withholds
53|35|Has he the knowledge of the unseen so that he can see (the future or the hidden)
53|36|Or, has he not been informed of what is in the scriptures of Moses
53|37|And of Abraham who fulfilled (the commandments or duties)
53|38|That no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another
53|39|And that man shall have nothing but what he strives for
53|40|And that his striving shall be seen
53|41|Then shall he be rewarded for it with the fullest reward
53|42|And that your Lord is the final goal
53|43|And that He it is Who makes men laugh and makes them weep
53|44|And that He it is Who causes death and gives life
53|45|And that He created pairs, the male and the female
53|46|From the small seed when it is placed (or lodged)
53|47|And that on Him depends (or He has ordained) the bringing forth a second time
53|48|And that He it is Who enriches and gives satisfaction (or fulfilment)
53|49|And that He is the Lord of Sirius
53|50|And that He did destroy the A´ad of old
53|51|And Thamud He spared not
53|52|And the people of Noah before them; surely they were most unjust and insolent transgressors
53|53|And He destroyed the Overthrown Cities (of Sodom and Gomorrah)
53|54|So that they were covered with that which covers
53|55|Then about which of your Lord´s gifts will you dispute
53|56|This is a Warner of (the series or like) the Warners of old
53|57|The threatened event (or Hour) draws nigh
53|58|There is none besides Allah to disclose (or actualise) it
53|59|Marvel you then at this announcement
53|60|And will you laugh and not weep
53|61|While you are indulging in vanities
53|62|So make obeisance (or prostrations) to Allah and serve Him
54|1|The hour drew nigh (or is nigh) and the moon was rent in twain (or is rent)
54|2|And if they see a Sign they turn aside and say, "Transient magic
54|3|And they call it a lie, and follow their own low desires; but every affair has its appointed term
54|4|And certainly some narratives have come to them wherein is a deterrent
54|5|Consummate wisdom - but warnings avail not
54|6|So turn your back on them for the Day when the Summoner summons them unto a terrible affair
54|7|With downcast eyes, they come forth from their graves as if they were scattered locusts
54|8|Hastening towards the Summoner. The unbelievers shall say, "This is a hard day
54|9|Before them the people of Noah rejected, yea they reject Our servant and called him mad, and he was driven away
54|10|Therefore he called upon his Lord, "I am overcome, come you then to help
54|11|So We opened the gates of heaven with water pouring forth
54|12|And We caused water to gush forth from the land in springs; so the waters gathered together and rose according to a measure already ordained
54|13|And We bore him on that (the Ark) which was made of planks and nails (or ties of palm-fibre)
54|14|Floating before Our eyes, a reward for him who was rejected
54|15|And certainly We left it as a sign, but is there anyone that remembers (or takes heed)
54|16|How great was then My punishment after My warning
54|17|And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed
54|18|A´ad treated the truth as a lie, so how great was My punishment after My warning
54|19|Surely We sent on them a tornado in a day of violent disaster
54|20|Tearing men away as if they were the trunks of palm-trees uprooted
54|21|How great was then My punishment after My warning
54|22|And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed
54|23|Thamud rejected the warning
54|24|So they said, "What! A single mortal from among us! Shall we follow him? Most surely we shall then be in sure error and madness
54|25|Can it be that the reminder has been sent to him of all the people among us? Nay! He is an insolent liar
54|26|Ah, tomorrow shall they know who is the liar, the insolent one
54|27|Surely We shall send them the she-camel as a trial; therefore, watch them and have patience
54|28|And inform them that the water is to be shared between them; every drinking shall be regulated
54|29|But they called their companion, who took (the sword) and hamstrung her
54|30|How great was then My punishment after My warning
54|31|Surely We sent upon them a single Shout (or Blast), so they became like the dry stubble which the maker of an enclosure collects
54|32|And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed
54|33|The people of Lot treated the warning. as a lie
54|34|Surely We sent upon them a storm with stones, except Lot´s followers; We saved them a little before daybreak
54|35|A favour from Us; thus do We reward him who gives thanks
54|36|And certainly he (Lot) warned them of Our violent punishment, but they obstinately disputed the warning
54|37|And they endeavoured to snatch away his guests from him, but We blinded their eyes; "So taste you My chastisement and My warning
54|38|And early in the morning a lasting chastisement overtook them
54|39|So taste you My chastisement after My warning
54|40|And certainly We have made the Quran easy for remembrance, but is there anyone who will heed
54|41|And certainly the warning came to Pharaoh´s people
54|42|They rejected all Our Signs, so We overtook them with such a penalty as comes from One Mighty, Powerful
54|43|Are the unbelievers of yours (O Quraish) better than these, or is there an exemption for you in the Sacred Books
54|44|Or do they say, "We are a host allied together to help each other
54|45|But soon shall the hosts be routed, and they shall flee
54|46|Nay, the Hour is their promised time, and the Hour shall be most grievous and bitter
54|47|Surely it is the guilty who are in error and madness
54|48|On the day when they shall be dragged upon their faces into the Fire, "Taste the touch of hell
54|49|Surely We have created everything according to a measure
54|50|And Our command is but one, as the twinkling of an eye
54|51|And certainly We have already destroyed the likes of you, but is there anyone who will heed
54|52|And everything they did is in the Scriptures (or the Record)
54|53|And everything small and great is recorded
54|54|Surely the righteous (who guard against evil) shall dwell among Gardens and Rivers
54|55|Established in the Assembly of Truth in the presence of an Omnipotent Sovereign
55|1|The Beneficent Allah
55|2|Taught (Has made known) the Quran
55|3|He created man
55|4|Taught him speech (language, modes of expression and communication)
55|5|The sun and the moon follow courses (exactly) reckoned (in space and time)
55|6|And the stars (or herds of animals) and the trees do adore (Him)
55|7|And the heaven, He raised it high, and He made the Balance (or set the measure)
55|8|That you may not exceed the measure (or transgress beyond limits)
55|9|But keep the measure strictly (with justice or equity) nor fall short of it (or be deficient in measuring)
55|10|And the earth, has He set out for (His) creatures
55|11|Therein is fruit and palms having sheathed clusters
55|12|And the grain with its husk and fragrant herbs
55|13|Which then of the bounties (favours, gifts)) of your Lord will you deny
55|14|He created man from dry clay like earthen vessels (as containers)
55|15|And He created the jinn of a flame of (or of smokeless) fire
55|16|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|17|He is the Lord of the two Easts and Lord of the two Wests
55|18|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|19|He has made the two seas (streams or bodies of water, salt and sweet) to flow freely so that they meet together
55|20|Between them is a barrier which they do not transgress
55|21|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|22|There come forth from them pearls and coral
55|23|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|24|And His are the ships reared aloft in the sea like mountains
55|25|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|26|All that is therein (on earth) must pass away
55|27|And there remains naught but the Countenance of your Lord of Might and Glory (or of Majesty and Nobility (Bounty and Honour)
55|28|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|29|All those who are in the heavens and the earth entreat (or need) Him; every moment is He in a (new?) state of Glory (or wields universal power)
55|30|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|31|Soon will We apply Ourselves to you, O you two worlds (men and jinn or outer and inner, manifest and hidden)
55|32|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|33|O assembly of the jinn and the men! If you are able to pass through the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass through; you cannot pass through but with authority
55|34|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|35|The flames of fire (to burn) and smoke (to choke) will be sent on you two, then you will have no defence
55|36|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|37|And when the heaven is rent asunder and then becomes red like red hide
55|38|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|39|So on that day neither man nor jinn shall be asked about his sin
55|40|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|41|The guilty shall be recognized by their marks, so they shall be seized by the forelocks and the feet
55|42|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|43|This is the hell which the guilty called a lie
55|44|They go circling between it and hot, boiling water
55|45|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|46|And for him who fears to stand before his Lord are two Gardens
55|47|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|48|Containing in them various kinds (trees and delights)
55|49|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|50|In both of them are two fountains (or streams) flowing
55|51|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|52|In both of them are two pairs of every fruit
55|53|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|54|Reclining on beds, the inner coverings of which are of silk brocade; and the fruits of the two gardens shall be within reach
55|55|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|56|In them shall be those who are chaste with restrained glances; whom neither man nor jinn shall have touched before them
55|57|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|58|As though they were rubies and corals (or pearls)
55|59|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|60|Is the reward of goodness other than goodness
55|61|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|62|And besides these two are two other Gardens
55|63|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|64|Both dark-green in colour (the colour of foliage well watered)
55|65|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|66|In both of them are two springs gushing forth
55|67|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|68|In both are fruits and date-palms and pomegranates
55|69|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|70|In them are goodly things and beautiful ones
55|71|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|72|Pure ones confined to pavilions
55|73|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|74|Man has not touched them before them nor jinn
55|75|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|76|Reclining on green cushions and rich carpets of beauty
55|77|Which then of the bounties of your Lord will you deny
55|78|Blessed be the name of your Lord, Mighty and Glorious
56|1|When the Inevitable Event comes to pass
56|2|There is no denying that it will come
56|3|Abasing some, exalting others
56|4|When the earth shall be shaken to its foundations
56|5|And the mountains shall be crumbled
56|6|So that they shall be as scattered dust
56|7|And you shall be sorted into three classes
56|8|First the companions of the right hand - what will be the companions of the right hand
56|9|And then the companions of the left hand - what will be the companions of the left hand
56|10|And those foremost (in faith) will be the foremost (in the Hereafter)
56|11|These are they who are drawn nigh (to Allah)
56|12|In the Gardens of Bliss
56|13|A multitude of those of old
56|14|And a few of those of later times
56|15|On thrones decorated
56|16|Reclining on them, facing one another
56|17|Round about them shall serve youths of permanent freshness (immortal or never altering in age)
56|18|With goblets and ewers and a cup filled from a pure fountain
56|19|They shall not suffer with headache thereby, nor shall they get intoxicated (or exhausted)
56|20|And fruits such as they choose
56|21|And the flesh of fowl and any as they desire
56|22|And pure, beautiful companions
56|23|The like of the well-preserved pearls
56|24|A reward for what they used to do
56|25|They shall not hear therein vain or sinful discourse
56|26|Except the saying, "Peace! Peace
56|27|And the companions of the right hand; what of the companions of the Right Hand
56|28|Amid thornless Lote-trees
56|29|And tall trees with clusters of flowers (or fruits) one above another
56|30|And spreading shade
56|31|And water flowing constantly
56|32|And abundant fruit
56|33|Neither intercepted nor forbidden
56|34|And exalted thrones
56|35|Surely We have created them into a new creation
56|36|And made them virgins pure
56|37|Loving friends, equals in age
56|38|For the sake of the companions of the right hand
56|39|A multitude of those of old
56|40|And a multitude of those of later times
56|41|And those of the left hand; what of those of the Left Hand
56|42|In hot wind and boiling water
56|43|And the shade of black smoke
56|44|Neither cool nor honourable
56|45|Surely they were before this made to live in ease and plenty
56|46|And they persisted in the great violation (or great sin)
56|47|And they used to say, "What! When we die and have become dust and bones, shall we then indeed be raised
56|48|Or our fathers of yore
56|49|Say, "The first and the last
56|50|Shall most surely be gathered together for the appointed hour of a known day
56|51|Then shall you, O you who err and call it a lie
56|52|Most surely eat of a tree of Zaqqum
56|53|And fill your bellies therewith
56|54|Then drink over it boiling water
56|55|And drink as drinks the thirsty camel
56|56|This is their entertainment on the Day of Requital
56|57|We have created you, why do you not then assent
56|58|Have you considered the seed (or what you emit)
56|59|Is it you that create it or are We the creators
56|60|We have ordained death among you and We are not to be frustrated
56|61|That We may transfigure you and make you grow into what you know not
56|62|And certainly you know the first growth, why do you not then reflect
56|63|Have you considered what you sow
56|64|Is it you that cause it to grow, or are We the cause
56|65|If We willed, We could crumble it to powder, then would you lament
56|66|Surely we are burdened with debt
56|67|Nay! We are deprived
56|68|Have you considered the water which you drink
56|69|Is it you that send it down from the clouds, or are We the senders
56|70|If We willed, We could have made it salty; why do you not then give thanks
56|71|Have you considered the fire which you strike
56|72|Is it you that produce the trees for it, or are We the producers
56|73|We have made it a reminder and a convenience for the dwellers of the deserts
56|74|Therefore, glorify the name of your Lord, the Supreme
56|75|But nay! I swear by the setting (or falling or fading) of stars
56|76|And most surely it is a very great oath if you only knew
56|77|Most surely it is an honoured Quran
56|78|In a book that is protected
56|79|None shall touch it save the purified ones
56|80|A revelation by the Lord of the worlds
56|81|Do you then hold this announcement in contempt
56|82|And make denial of it your means of subsistence
56|83|Why then do you not (intervene) when the soul comes up to the throat (of a dying person)
56|84|And you the while look on
56|85|And We are nearer to it (the soul) than you, but you see not
56|86|Then why, if you are not under Our authority
56|87|Force back (the soul), if you are truthful (about your independence)
56|88|Then if he is one of those Near to Allah
56|89|(There is for him) Satisfaction and Bounty and a Garden of Bliss
56|90|And if he is one of those on the Right Hand
56|91|Then (the salutation) "Peace to you" from the companions of the Right Hand
56|92|And if he is one of the rejecters, the erring ones
56|93|He shall have an entertainment of boiling water
56|94|And burning in Hell
56|95|Most surely this is a certain truth (or the Truth of Certainty)
56|96|Therefore glorify the name of your Lord, the Supreme
57|1|Whatever is in the heavens and the earth declares the glory of Allah, and He is the Mighty, the Wise

57|8|And what reasons have you that you should not believe in Allah? And the Messenger calls on you that you may believe in your Lord, and indeed He has made a covenant with you if you are believers
57|9|He it is who sends down clear revelations upon His servant, that he may bring you forth from darkness into light; and lo! For you Allah is most Kind, Merciful

67|4|Then turn back your eye again and again; your sight will return unto you weak and fatigued
67|5|And certainly We have adorned this lower heaven with lamps and We have made these missiles for Satan, and We have prepared for them the chastisement of burning
67|6|And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of hell, and evil is the destination
67|7|When they shall be cast therein, they shall hear a loud gasp as it swells
67|8|Almost bursting for fury. Whenever a group is cast into it, its keeper shall ask them, "Did there not come to you a Warner
67|9|They shall say, "Yea! Indeed there came to us a Warner, but we rejected him and said, ´Allah has not revealed anything, you are only suffering from delusions.´
67|10|And they shall say, "Had we but listened or pondered (used our reason or intelligence), we should not have been among the inmates of the Blazing Fire
67|11|So they shall acknowledge their sins, but far will be forgiveness from the inmates of the Blazing Fire
67|12|Lo! Those who fear their Lord in secret (or unseen), they shall surely have forgiveness and a great reward
67|13|And whether you conceal your opinion or express it; surely He is Aware of what is in the heart
67|14|Should He not know, He Who created? And He is the Knower of the Subtleties, the Aware
67|15|He it is Who made the earth smooth (manageable) for you, therefore go about in the spacious paths thereof, and eat of His provisions, and to Him is the Resurrection after death
67|16|Have you taken security from Him Who is in heaven that He will not make the earth swallow you when it is shaken (convulsed)
67|17|Or have you taken security from Him Who is in heaven that He will not send down upon you a hurricane so that you shall know how terrible was My warning
67|18|And verily those before them rejected the truth, then how terrible was My wrath
67|19|Have they not seen the birds above them expanding (their wings) and contracting (them)? What is it that withholds them save the Beneficent? Lo! He is Seer of all things
67|20|Or who is it that will be an army to assist you besides the Beneficent? The unbelievers are in naught but delusion
67|21|Or who is it that will provide you if He should withhold His sustenance? Nay! They persist in disdain and aversion (from truth)
67|22|What! Is he who goes prone upon his face better guided or he who walks upright upon a Straight Way
67|23|Say, "He it is Who brought you into being and made for you the faculties of hearing and seeing and heart: little is it that you give thanks
67|24|Say, "He it is Who multiplied you in the earth and to Him you shall be gathered
67|25|And they say, "When shall this promise be (fulfilled) if you are truthful
67|26|Say, " The knowledge thereof is only with Allah and I am only a plain Warner
67|27|But when they shall see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve shall be sorry, and it shall be said, "This is that which you used to call for
67|28|Say (O Muhammad), "Have you considered if Allah should cause me and those with me to be destroyed or has mercy on us, still, who will protect the disbelievers from a painful doom
67|29|Say, "He is the Beneficent. We believe in Him and in Him do we put our trust. And you will come to know who it is that is in error manifest
67|30|Say, "Have you considered if all your water should some morning be lost down into the earth, who is it then that will supply you clear flowing water
68|1|NUN. I swear by the Pen and by that which they write
68|2|By the grace of your Lord you (Muhammad) are not mad (or stupid, deluded or possessed)
68|3|And most surely you shall have a reward unfailing
68|4|And most surely you have the most sublime (or exalted) character
68|5|Soon will you see, and they too shall see
68|6|Which of you is afflicted with madness (stupidity or delusion)
68|7|Surely your Lord best knows him who errs from His way, and He best knows the followers of the right guidance
68|8|So do not yield to the rejecters
68|9|They desire that you should be pliant (or compromise) so they too would be pliant (compromise)
68|10|And yield not to any mean swearer
68|11|Defamer, going about with slander
68|12|Hinderer (obstructer) of good, transgressor beyond limits, malefactor
68|13|Ignoble (violent, cruel and greedy), besides all that, base-born (inherently degenerate)
68|14|Because he possesses wealth and sons
68|15|When Our communications are recited to him, he says, "Stories of those of old
68|16|We will brand him on the snout
68|17|Surely We will try them as We tried the people of the garden, when they resolved to cut the produce in the morning
68|18|And were not willing to set aside a portion (for the poor)
68|19|Then there encompassed it (the garden) a visitation from your Lord while they were sleeping
68|20|So it became as black, barren land
68|21|And they called out to each other in the morning (unaware of what had happened)
68|22|Saying, "Go early to your tilth if you would cut the produce
68|23|So they went, while they murmured to each other secretly
68|24|Saying, "Let no poor man enter it today besides you
68|25|And in the morning they went, strong in this (evil) resolve
68|26|But when they saw it (the garden), they said, "Most surely we have gone astray
68|27|Nay! We are made to suffer privation
68|28|The best of them said, "Did I not say to you, ´Why not glorify (Allah)?´
68|29|They said, "Glory be to our Lord, surely we were unjust
68|30|Then some of them advanced against others, blaming each other
68|31|Said they, "O woe to us! Surely we were outrageous transgressors
68|32|Maybe, our Lord will give us instead a garden better than this; lo! We beseech (or turn in repentance to) our Lord
68|33|Such is the chastisement, and certainly the chastisement of the Hereafter is even greater, did they but know
68|34|Surely those who guard against evil shall have with their Lord Gardens of Delight
68|35|What! Shall We then treat those who have Surrendered (in Islam) as those who are guilty
68|36|What ails you? How do you judge
68|37|Or have you a Book wherein you learn
68|38|That you shall have through it whatever you choose
68|39|Or have you received from Us an agreement, confirmed by an oath, extending until the Day of Resurrection, that you shall have what you demand
68|40|Ask them which of them will vouch for that
68|41|Or have they associates (in the Godhead); then let them produce them if they are truthful
68|42|On the day when the Shin (the Hidden Mystery or Truth) shall be laid bare, and they shall be called upon to make obeisance, but they shall not be able
68|43|Their looks cast down, abasement shall overtake them seeing that they had been called upon to make obeisance indeed while yet they were safe
68|44|So leave Me and him who rejects this Announcement (The Message of Muhammad); We will overtake them by degrees, from whence they perceive not
68|45|Yet I do bear with them, for lo! My plan is firm
68|46|Or do you ask from them a reward, so that they are burdened with debt
68|47|Or have they the knowledge of the unseen, so that they write it down
68|48|So wait patiently for the judgment of your Lord, and be not like the Companion of the Fish (Jonah), when he cried while he was in distress
68|49|Were it not that favour from his Lord had reached him, he would certainly have been cast down upon the naked shore while he was blameworthy
68|50|Then his Lord chose him, and He made him of the righteous
68|51|And those who disbelieve would almost smite you with their eyes when they hear the Reminder (Quran), and they say, "Most surely he is mad (or possessed)
68|52|And it is naught but a reminder to creation (or all the worlds)
69|1|The sure Reality
69|2|What is the sure Reality
69|3|And what would make you realize what the sure Reality is
69|4|Thamud and A´ad called the Stunning Calamity (the Day of Judgment) a lie
69|5|But the Thamud, they were destroyed by the Storm of thunder and lightening
69|6|And the A´ad, they were destroyed by a roaring, violent wind
69|7|Which He made to prevail against them for seven nights and eight days unremittingly, so that you might have seen the people therein prostrate as if they were the trunks of hollow palms
69|8|Do you then see any of them remaining
69|9|And Pharaoh and those before him and the overthrown cities (Sodom and Gomorrah) continuously committed sins
69|10|And they disobeyed the Messengers of their Lord, so He punished them with a severe punishment
69|11|Surely We bore you (mankind) up in the Ark when the water rose high
69|12|So that We may make it a reminder to you, and that the retaining ear might retain it (in memory)
69|13|And when the trumpet is blown with a single blast
69|14|And the earth and the mountains are borne away and crushed with a single crushing
69|15|On that day shall the Great Event come to pass
69|16|And the heaven shall cleave asunder, so that on that Day it shall be frail
69|17|And the angels shall be on the sides thereof; and above them eight shall bear the Throne of their Lord that Day
69|18|On that day you shall be exposed to view, no secret of yours shall remain hidden
69|19|Then as for him who is given his book in his right hand, he will say, "Here! Read my book
69|20|Surely I knew that I shall meet my account
69|21|So he shall be in a life of Bliss
69|22|In a lofty garden
69|23|The fruits of which are near at hand
69|24|Eat and drink pleasantly for what you did beforehand in the days gone by
69|25|And as for him who is given his book in his left hand he shall say, "O would that my book had never been given me
69|26|And I did not know how my account stood
69|27|O would that it (death) had made an end of me
69|28|My wealth has availed me nothing
69|29|My authority has perished away from me
69|30|(The command is given) "Seize him, and chain him
69|31|Then cast him into the burning Fire
69|32|Then march him tied to a chain the length of which is seventy cubits
69|33|Surely he did not believe in Allah, the Great
69|34|Nor did he urge the feeding of the poor
69|35|Therefore he has not here today a true friend
69|36|Nor any food except filth
69|37|Which none but the wrongdoers eat
69|38|But nay! I swear (or call to witness) by that which you see
69|39|And that which you do not see
69|40|Most surely, it is the Word brought by an honoured Messenger
69|41|And it is not the word of a poet; little is it that you believe
69|42|Nor the word of a soothsayer; little is it that you mind
69|43|It is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds
69|44|And if he had fabricated against Us some of the sayings
69|45|We would certainly have seized him by the right hand
69|46|Then We would certainly have severed his life-artery
69|47|And not one of you could have withheld Us from him
69|48|And verily, it is a reminder for those who guard against evil
69|49|And verily, We know that some of you are rejecters
69|50|And verily, it is a source of great grief to the unbelievers
69|51|And verily, it is the Truth of Certainty
69|52|Therefore-glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High
70|1|A questioner asked about the chastisement which must befall
70|2|The unbelievers, which none can avert
70|3|From Allah, the Lord of the Ascending Stairways
70|4|To Him ascend the angels and the Spirit in a Day the measure of which is fifty thousand years
70|5|Therefore endure with a goodly patience
70|6|Surely they think it to be far off
70|7|And We see it nigh
70|8|On the day when the heaven shall be as molten copper
70|9|And the mountains shall be as tufts of wool
70|10|And friend shall not ask of friend
70|11|Though they shall be given sight of each other. The guilty one would fain redeem himself from the chastisement of that day by sacrificing his children
70|12|And his wife and his brother
70|13|And the nearest of his kinsfolk who gave him shelter
70|14|And all those that are in the earth, hoping to be delivered
70|15|By no means! Surely it is a flaming Fire
70|16|Dragging him right to his skull
70|17|It calls him who turned and fled from truth
70|18|And amasses wealth then locks it up
70|19|Surely man is created anxious (or impatient)
70|20|Fretful when evil afflicts him
70|21|And niggardly when good befalls him
70|22|Except those who pray
70|23|Those who are constant (or devoted) at their prayer
70|24|And those in whose wealth there is a fixed portion
70|25|For him who begs and for him who is destitute
70|26|And those who accept the truth of the Day of Judgment
70|27|And those who are fearful of the displeasure of their Lord
70|28|Surely the displeasure of their Lord is a thing before which none can feel secure (or is the opposite of peace and tranquillity)
70|29|And those who guard their chastity
70|30|Except in the case of their wives or those whom their right hands possess - for on these surely is no blame
70|31|But he who seeks to go beyond this, these it is that transgress beyond bounds
70|32|And those who are faithful to their trusts and their covenant
70|33|And those who are upright in their testimonies
70|34|And those who keep guard (the sacredness of) their worship
70|35|Those shall be in Gardens, honoured
70|36|But what ails those who disbelieve that they rush around you (Muhammad) open-eyed (in mock amazement)
70|37|On the right hand and on the left, in sundry groups
70|38|Does every man of them desire that he should be made to enter the Garden of Bliss
70|39|By no means! Surely We have created them of what they know (earth and spirit)
70|40|But nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the Lord of all points of the rising and setting places East and West that We are certainly Able
70|41|To replace them with others better than them, and We shall not be overcome
70|42|Therefore leave them alone to go on with the false discourses and to sport until they come face to face with that Day of theirs with which they are warned
70|43|The Day on which they shall come forth from their graves in haste, as if they were racing to a goal
70|44|Their eyes cast down; disgrace shall overtake them; that is the Day which they were promised
71|1|Lo! We sent Noah to his people, saying, "Warn your people before there come upon them a painful doom
71|2|He said, "O my people! Surely I am a plain Warner to you
71|3|That you should serve Allah and be careful of your duty to Him and obey me
71|4|He will forgive you some of your faults and grant you a delay for an appointed term; surely the term of Allah when it comes is not postponed; did you but know
71|5|He said, "O my Lord! Surely I have called my people by night and by day
71|6|But my call has only increased their flight (from truth)
71|7|And whenever I have called them that you may forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, cover themselves with their garments, grow obstinate and puffed up with pride
71|8|So I called to them aloud
71|9|And lo! I have made public proclamations unto them, and I have appealed to them in private
71|10|And I have said, ´Ask forgiveness of your Lord, surely He is the most Forgiving
71|11|´He will send down upon you an abundance of rain
71|12|´And help you with wealth and sons, and bestow on you gardens, and bestow on you rivers
71|13|´What ails you that you fear not the greatness of Allah
71|14|´Seeing that He has created you through various stages
71|15|´Do you not see how Allah has created the seven heavens, one above another (or in harmony)
71|16|´And made the moon therein a light, and made the sun a lamp
71|17|´And Allah has made you out of the earth as a gradual growth
71|18|´Then He returns you to it, and then will He bring you forth a new bringing forth
71|19|´And Allah has made for you the earth a wide expanse
71|20|´ That you may go about in it in spacious paths (or valleys).´
71|21|Noah said, "My Lord! Surely they have disobeyed me and followed him whose wealth and children have added to him nothing but loss
71|22|And they devised a mighty plot
71|23|And they say (to each other), ´By no means leave your gods, abandon neither Wadd, nor Suwa, nor Yaghut, and Yauq and Nasr (their gods).´
71|24|And indeed they have led astray many, and do not increase the unjust in aught but error
71|25|Because of their wrongs they were drowned, then made to enter Fire, so they did not find any helpers besides Allah
71|26|And Noah said, "My Lord! Leave not upon the land any dweller from among the unbelievers
71|27|For surely if you leave them they will lead astray Thy servants, and will not beget any but immoral, ungrateful ones
71|28|My Lord! Forgive me and my parents and him who enters my house believing, and the believing men and the believing women; and do not increase the unjust in aught but perdition
72|1|Say, "It has been revealed to me that a company of the jinn listened, and they said, "Surely we have heard a wonderful Recital (Quran)
72|2|Guiding to the right way. So we believe in it, and we will not join any one with our Lord (in worship)
72|3|And that He, exalted be the majesty of our Lord, has not taken a consort, nor a son
72|4|The foolish amongst us used to invent extravagant things against Allah
72|5|And lo! We thought (or think) that men and jinn did not (or ought not to) utter a lie against Allah
72|6|And, indeed, persons from among men used to seek refuge with persons from among jinn, so they increased them in wrongdoing (or folly or revolt)
72|7|And they thought as you think, that Allah would not raise anyone (to be judged)
72|8|And we sought to reach heaven, but we found it filled with strong guards and flaming fires (or meteors)
72|9|And we used to sit in some high hidden places therein to steal a hearing, but he who would try to listen now would find a flame lying in wait for him
72|10|We know not whether evil is meant for those who are on earth or whether their Lord means to bring them good
72|11|And some of us are righteous and others of us are far from that: we are sects following different ways
72|12|But we know that we cannot escape (or frustrate) Allah in the earth, nor can we escape (or frustrate) Him by flight
72|13|And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it (or accepted it); whoever believes in his Lord, he neither fears loss nor oppression (injustice or disgrace)
72|14|Some of us are those who have Surrendered (to Allah), and some of us are deviators. Those who have Surrender have surely taken the right path purposefully
72|15|As for the deviators, they are the fuel of Hell
72|16|If they should keep to the right way, We would certainly give them to drink of abundant water
72|17|So that We might test them therewith. And whoever turns aside from the remembrance of his Lord, He will afflict him with a severe penalty
72|18|The places of worship are only Allah´s, therefore call not upon any one along with Allah
72|19|And yet when the servant of Allah stood up in prayer to Him, they crowded almost stifling him
72|20|Say, "I only call upon my Lord, and I do not associate any one with Him
72|21|Say, "I do not control for you evil or good
72|22|Say, "Surely no one can protect me against Allah, nor can I find besides Him any place of refuge
72|23|Unless I proclaim what I receive from Allah and His messages; and whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger surely he shall have the fire of Hell to abide therein for ever
72|24|Until when they see what they are promised, then shall they know who it is that is weaker in helpers and fewer in number
72|25|Say, "I do not know whether that which you are promised be nigh or whether my Lord will appoint for it a distant term
72|26|He is the Knower of the unseen! And He reveals unto none His secrets
72|27|Except messengers whom He has chosen; and then He makes a guard to go before him and after him
72|28|So that He may know that they have truly delivered the messages of their Lord. He encompasses what is with them and He keeps count of all things
73|1|O you wrapped up in your garment
73|2|Rise to pray in the night except a little (or but not all night)
73|3|Half of it, or lessen it a little
73|4|Or add to it, and recite the Quran as it ought to be recited
73|5|Surely We will make to light upon you (charge you with) a weighty Word (or message)
73|6|Surely the vigil of the night is the most potent for the soul (to receive impressions) and the best for framing speech (or the Words of prayer)
73|7|Surely you have in the daytime a long occupation (with ordinary affairs of life)
73|8|And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with exclusive (and wholehearted) devotion
73|9|(He is) The Lord of the East and the West - there is no God but He - therefore, take Him for a protector
73|10|And bear patiently what they say and avoid them with a becoming avoidance (or leave taking)
73|11|And leave Me to deal with the rejecters, the possessors of ease and plenty, and bear with them a little
73|12|Surely with Us are heavy fetters and a raging fire
73|13|And food that chokes and a painful doom
73|14|On the day when the earth and the mountains shall quake and the mountains shall become (as) heaps of running sand
73|15|Surely We have sent unto you a Messenger, a witness against you, as We sent a Messenger to Pharaoh
73|16|But Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger, so We seized him with a violent grip
73|17|How, then, will you guard yourselves, if you disbelieve, on the day which shall make children grey-headed (with stress)
73|18|The heaven shall rend asunder thereby; His promise is ever brought to fulfilment
73|19|Surely this is a reminder, let then him, who will, take the way to his Lord
73|20|Your Lord does know that you stand in prayer nearly two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half of it, and sometimes a third of it, and so also do a party of those with you; and Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you are not able to keep
74|1|O you enveloped in your cloak
74|2|Arise and warn
74|3|And magnify your Lord
74|4|And your cloak do purify
74|5|And uncleanness do shun
74|6|And bestow not favours that you may receive again with increase
74|7|And for the sake of your Lord, be patient
74|8|For when the trumpet is sounded
74|9|That, at that time, shall be a Day of distress
74|10|Far from easy for the unbelievers
74|11|Leave Me alone to deal with him whom I created
74|12|And gave vast riches
74|13|And sons to be by his side
74|14|And I adjusted the affairs of life to go smoothly and appropriately for him
74|15|And yet he desires that I should add more
74|16|By no means! For lo! He stubbornly opposes Our revelations
74|17|Will impose on him a fearful doom
74|18|Surely he reflected and then plotted
74|19|But woe to him for how he plotted
74|20|Again, woe to him for how he plotted
74|21|Then he looked around
74|22|Then he frowned and scowled
74|23|Then he turned back and was inflated with pride
74|24|Then he said, "This is naught but enchantment, narrated of olden days
74|25|This is naught but the word of a mortal
74|26|Soon will I cast him into the burning (Hell-fire)
74|27|And what will make you understand what the burning (Hell-fire) is
74|28|It leaves naught, it spares naught
74|29|It scorches (darkens the colour) and shrivels the mortal
74|30|Over it are nineteen
74|31|And We have not made the wardens of the fire others than angels, and We have not made their number but as a trial for those who disbelieve, that those who have been given the Book (scriptures) may be certain and those who believe may increase in faith, an
74|32|Nay; I swear by (or call to witness) the moon
74|33|And by the night when it departs
74|34|And by the Dawn when it shines forth
74|35|Surely, this is but one of the mighty Signs
74|36|A warning to mortals
74|37|To him among you who wishes to go forward or remain behind
74|38|Every soul is held in pledge for its own deeds
74|39|Except the people of the right hand
74|40|In Gardens, they shall ask each other
74|41|And ask the guilty
74|42|What has brought you into hell
74|43|They shall say, "We were not of those who prayed
74|44|And we used not to feed the poor
74|45|And we used to enter into vain discourse with those who entered into vain discourses
74|46|And we used to call the Day of Judgment a lie
74|47|Till the inevitable event (death) overtook us
74|48|The intercession of no mediators shall avail them then
74|49|What is then the matter with them that they turn away from the admonition
74|50|As if they were frightened asses
74|51|Fleeing from a lion
74|52|Nay; every one of them desires that he may be given pages spread out (or open)
74|53|Nay! But they do not fear the Hereafter
74|54|Nay! This surely is an admonition
74|55|Let any who will, pay heed (or remember)
74|56|But none will remember (or heed) unless Allah wills. He is the source of fear (or righteousness) and the source of Mercy
75|1|Nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the Day of Resurrection
75|2|Nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the self-accusing soul
75|3|Does man think that We shall not gather his bones
75|4|Yea! We are able to make complete his very fingertips
75|5|Nay! Man desires to give the lie to what is before him
75|6|He asks, "When is the day of resurrection
75|7|So when the sight becomes dazzled
75|8|And the moon becomes dark
75|9|And the sun and the moon are brought together
75|10|Man shall say on that day, "Whither can I flee for refuge
75|11|By no means! There shall be no place of refuge
75|12|With your Lord alone shall on that day be the place of rest
75|13|Man shall on that day be informed of what he sent before and what he put off
75|14|Nay! Man is telling evidence against himself
75|15|Though he puts forth his excuses
75|16|Move not your tongue with it (the Quran) to make haste with it
75|17|Surely it is for Us to collect it and to recite (or enact) it
75|18|Therefore when We have recited it, follow its recitation
75|19|Nay, more, it is for Us to explain (and clarify) it
75|20|Nay! But you do love the fleeting Now
75|21|And neglect the Hereafter
75|22|Some faces on that Day shall be bright
75|23|Looking to their Lord
75|24|And other faces on that Day shall be gloomy
75|25|Knowing that there will be made to befall them some great calamity
75|26|Nay! When the soul comes up to the throat
75|27|And it is said, "Who will be a magician (to restore him)
75|28|And he is sure that it is the time of parting
75|29|And one leg will be tied to another (i.e. after death)
75|30|To your Lord on that day shall be the driving
75|31|So he did not accept the truth, nor did he pray
75|32|But called the truth a lie and turned back
75|33|Then he went to his folk, arrogant
75|34|Nearer unto you and nearer (comes the doom)
75|35|Again, nearer unto you and nearer (comes the doom)
75|36|Does man think that he is to be left to wander aimless (or purposeless)
75|37|Was he not a small seed in the seminal elements
75|38|Then he was a clot of blood, so He created (him) then made (him) perfect
75|39|Then He made of him two kinds, the male and the female
75|40|Is not He able to give life to the dead
76|1|Was there not over man a long period of time when he was a thing unremembered (nothing, not worth mention)
76|2|Surely We have created man from a small mingled life-germ; in order to try him, We made him hearing and seeing
76|3|Surely We have shown him the way: he may be thankful or unthankful
76|4|Surely We have prepared for the unbelievers chains and yokes and a burning fire
76|5|Surely the righteous shall drink of a cup the admixture of which is camphor
76|6|A fountain from which the servants of Allah shall drink, flows with abundance
76|7|Because they fulfil their vows and fear a day the evil of which spreads far and wide
76|8|And they give food out of love for Allah to the poor and the orphan and the captive
76|9|(Saying) We only feed you for Allah´s sake; we desire from you neither reward nor thanks
76|10|Surely we fear from our Lord a stern, distressful day
76|11|Therefore Allah will deliver them from the evil of that day and will shed on them the Light of Beauty and Joy
76|12|And reward them, because they were patient, with a Garden and garments of silk
76|13|Reclining therein on raised couches, they shall find therein neither the severe heat of the sun nor intense cold
76|14|And shade thereof is close upon them, and clustered fruits thereof bow down
76|15|And amongst them shall be passed vessels of silver and goblets of crystal
76|16|(Transparent as) glass but made of silver; they will determine the measure thereof
76|17|And they will be given to drink therein a cup whereof the mixture is of Zanjabil
76|18|From a fountain therein named Salsabil
76|19|And they will be served by youths never altering in age; when you see them you will think them to be scattered pearls
76|20|And when you look, you will see blessings and a magnificent kingdom
76|21|Upon them will be garments of fine green silk and gold brocade, and they shall be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them a drink pure and holy
76|22|Lo! This is a reward for you, and your striving has been recognised and accepted
76|23|Lo! We, even We have revealed the Quran to you in stages
76|24|Therefore wait patiently for the command of your Lord, and obey not from among them one who is guilty or ungrateful
76|25|And glorify the name of your Lord morning and evening
76|26|And during part of the night adore Him, and glorify Him a long part of the night
76|27|But they love the transitory life and put away behind them (ignore the remembrance of) a grievous Day
76|28|We, even We created them and made firm their frame, and when We will We will replace them, bringing others like them in their stead
76|29|Surely this is an admonition; whoever will, let him take a straight path to his Lord
76|30|But you will not, except as Allah wills, surely Allah is Knower, Wise
76|31|He makes whom He will enter into His mercy; and for evildoers, He has prepared a painful doom
77|1|I swear by (or call to witness) the emissary winds sent one after another for men´s benefit
77|2|By the raging hurricanes
77|3|Which scatter things far and wide
77|4|And separate things one from another
77|5|Then I swear by the angels who bring down the revelation (or message)
77|6|To clarify or to warn
77|7|Most surely what you are promised must come to pass
77|8|So when the stars are made dim
77|9|And when the heaven is rent asunder
77|10|And when the mountains are carried away as dust
77|11|And when the messengers are gathered at their appointed time
77|12|To what Day are these signs appointed
77|13|To the Day of Decision
77|14|And what will make you comprehend what the day of decision is
77|15|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|16|Did We not destroy the former generations
77|17|Then did We follow them up with later ones
77|18|Even thus shall We deal with the guilty
77|19|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|20|Did We not create you from a fluid regarded contemptible
77|21|Which We laid in a safe abode (the womb)
77|22|Till an appointed term
77|23|Thus We arrange things - how well are We at arranging things
77|24|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|25|Have We not made the earth draw together to itself
77|26|The living and the dead
77|27|And placed therein lofty mountains, and given you to drink sweet water from them
77|28|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|29|Go on to that which you used to deny
77|30|Go on to the smoke with three branches (or three fold shadow)
77|31|Neither having the coolness of the shade nor availing against the flame
77|32|Surely it sends up sparks like palaces
77|33|As if they were tawny camels
77|34|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|35|This is the day on which they shall not speak
77|36|Nor are they permitted to make excuses (or pleas)
77|37|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|38|This is the Day of Decision: We have gathered you and those of yore
77|39|So if you have a plan, plan against Me now
77|40|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|41|Surely those who guard against evil shall be amid shades and fountains
77|42|And fruits such as they desire
77|43|Eat and drink pleasantly because of what you did
77|44|Surely thus do We reward the doers of good
77|45|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|46|Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little; surely you are guilty
77|47|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|48|And when it is said to them, "Bow down (in humility), they bow not
77|49|Woe on that day to the rejecters
77|50|In what announcement, then, after this, will they believe
78|1|Of what do they question one another
78|2|About the Great News
78|3|About which they are in disagreement
78|4|Verily, they shall soon come to know
78|5|Verily, verily, they shall soon come to know
78|6|Have We not made the earth an expanse
78|7|And the mountains as projections (thereon)
78|8|And created you in pairs
78|9|And made your sleep for rest
78|10|And made the night to be a covering
78|11|And made the day for livelihood and activity
78|12|And made above you seven firmaments (heavens)
78|13|And placed therein a shining lamp (the Sun)
78|14|And do We not send down from the clouds water in abundance
78|15|That We may bring forth thereby corn and vegetable
78|16|And gardens dense and luxuriant
78|17|Surely the Day of Decision (or Sorting ) is a thing appointed
78|18|The day on which the trumpet shall be blown so you shall come forth in hosts
78|19|And the heaven shall be opened as if it were all doors
78|20|And the mountains shall be moved off so that they shall remain a mere semblance
78|21|Surely hell lies in ambush
78|22|A destination for those who transgress the bounds
78|23|Abiding therein for ages
78|24|They shall not taste therein anything cool nor drink
78|25|But boiling and intensely cold water
78|26|Requital corresponding (or proportional to their state)
78|27|Surely they feared not the account
78|28|And called Our revelations a lie with strong denial
78|29|And We have preserved all things in a Record
78|30|So taste you (the fruits of your deeds)! For We will not add to you aught but torment
78|31|Surely for the righteous is achievement (or success, self-fulfilment)
78|32|Gardens and vineyards
78|33|And those showing freshness of youth, equals in age
78|34|And a pure cup
78|35|They shall not hear therein any vain words nor lying
78|36|A reward from your Lord, a gift according to reckoning (or sufficient)
78|37|From the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Beneficent Allah, with whom none can argue
78|38|The day on which the Spirit and the angels shall stand arrayed; they speak not except him whom the Beneficent permits and who speaks aright
78|39|That is the Day of Certain Reality, so whoever desires may take refuge with his Lord
78|40|Surely We have warned you of a doom near at hand: the day when man shall see that which his two hands have sent before, and the unbeliever shall say, "O! Would that I were dust
79|1|I swear by (or call to witness) those who tear out to destruction
79|2|And by those rushing
79|3|And by those who float
79|4|Then press forward as in a race
79|5|And those who regulate affairs
79|6|The day on which the first trump resounds (or that which can quake shall quake)
79|7|And others follow it
79|8|Hearts on that day shall palpitate
79|9|While eyes are cast down
79|10|They say, "Shall we indeed be restored to our first state
79|11|What! When we are rotten bones
79|12|They said, "That then would be a return, causing loss
79|13|But it shall be only a single cry
79|14|When lo! They will be fully awake
79|15|Has not there come to you the story of Moses
79|16|When his Lord called upon him in the holy valley of Tuwa
79|17|(Saying,) "Go to Pharaoh, surely he has transgressed beyond bounds
79|18|Then say, "Have you a desire to purify yourself
79|19|And I will guide you to your Lord so that you may fear
79|20|So he showed him the Mighty Sign
79|21|But he (Pharaoh) rejected it and disobeyed
79|22|Then turned he away (from Allah) in haste
79|23|Then he gathered (men) and made a proclamation
79|24|Saying, "I am your Lord, the most high
79|25|So Allah seized him with the punishment of the Hereafter and the former life
79|26|Most surely there is in this a lesson to him who fears
79|27|Are you the harder to create or the heaven? He created it
79|28|He raised high its height, and gave it order and perfection
79|29|And He made dark its night and its splendour does He bring out with light
79|30|And after that He expanded (spread) the earth
79|31|He brought forth from it its water and its pasturage
79|32|And the mountains, He made them firm
79|33|A provision for you and for your cattle
79|34|But when the great overwhelming calamity comes
79|35|The Day on which man shall recollect all he strove after
79|36|And Hell shall be made manifest to him who sees
79|37|Then for him who has transgressed all bounds
79|38|And prefers the life of this world
79|39|Surely, Hell will be his abode
79|40|And as for him who had feared standing in the presence of his Lord and restrains his soul from lust (or low desires)
79|41|Then surely the Garden, that is his abode
79|42|They ask you (Muhammad) about the Hour, when it will come
79|43|What," ask they, "have you to say about it
79|44|To your Lord belongs the knowledge of it
79|45|you are only a Warner to him who would fear it
79|46|On the day that they behold it, it will be as though they had not tarried but an evening or the morning
80|1|He frowned and turned his back
80|2|Because there came to him the blind man
80|3|And what would make you know that he would grow (spiritually)
80|4|Or that he might become heedful so that the reminder should profit him
80|5|As for him who considers himself independent (or self-sufficient)
80|6|To him do you attend
80|7|Yet no blame is on you if he grow not (spiritually)
80|8|And as to him who comes to you striving earnestly
80|9|And with the fear of Allah in his heart
80|10|From him were you unmindful (or distracted)
80|11|Nay! Verily, it is an admonishment (or a message of instructions)
80|12|So let whoever will pay heed to it
80|13|It is in honoured books
80|14|Exalted, purified
80|15|Set down by scribes
80|16|Noble and righteous
80|17|Cursed (self-destroyed) is man! How ungrateful (to Allah) is he
80|18|Of what stuff did He create him
80|19|Of a small seed; He created him, then gave him due proportions
80|20|Then He made his way easy for him
80|21|Then He causes him to die and buries him in his grave
80|22|Then when He wills, He will raise him to life again
80|23|Nay; but man has not done that which He bade him
80|24|Then let man consider his food
80|25|That We pour down the water in abundance
80|26|Then We cleave the earth
80|27|Then We cause to grow therein the grain
80|28|And grapes and clover
80|29|And the olive and the palm
80|30|And dense luxurious gardens
80|31|And fruits and herbage
80|32|A provision for you and for your cattle
80|33|But when the Deafening Noise (cataclysm) comes
80|34|The Day on which a man shall fly from his brother
80|35|And his mother and his father
80|36|And his spouse and his children
80|37|Every man of them shall on that Day be occupied with concerns which will make him heedless of others
80|38|Many faces on that Day shall be bright as dawn (or beaming with light)
80|39|Laughing, rejoicing
80|40|And many faces on that Day, shall be covered with dust
80|41|Veiled in darkness
80|42|These are the disbelievers, the wicked
81|1|When the sun is overthrown (or folded up)
81|2|And when the stars darken
81|3|And when the mountains pass away
81|4|And when the she-camels (with young) are left untended
81|5|And when the wild beasts are herded together
81|6|And when the seas swell and boil
81|7|And when souls are sorted and reunited
81|8|And when the female infant buried alive is asked
81|9|For what sin she was killed
81|10|And when the Record Books are spread open
81|11|And when the heavens are unveiled
81|12|And when Hell is kindled up
81|13|And when the Garden is brought nigh
81|14|Every soul shall then know what it has prepared
81|15|But nay! I swear by (or call to witness) the Planets
81|16|That run their course and hide themselves
81|17|And the Night when it departs
81|18|And the Dawn when it breaths away the darkness
81|19|Most surely it is the Word of an honourable Messenger
81|20|The possessor of power and high rank with the Lord of the Throne
81|21|One to be obeyed, and faithful to his trust
81|22|And your companion is not one possessed (or mad)
81|23|And of a truth he saw himself on the clear horizon
81|24|Nor is he a tenacious concealer of the unseen
81|25|Nor is it the word of the cursed Satan
81|26|Whither then will you go
81|27|It is naught but a reminder unto all creation (or all the worlds)
81|28|For him among you who wills to go straight
81|29|And you will not, unless Allah wills, the Lord (or Cherisher) of Creation (or all the Worlds)
82|1|When the heavens are cleft asunder
82|2|And when the stars are dispersed
82|3|And when the oceans are suffered to burst forth
82|4|And when the graves are overturned
82|5|Every soul shall know what it has sent before and held back
82|6|O man! What has beguiled you from your Lord, the Gracious one
82|7|Who created you, then completed your form in due proportions, then gave you balance (or an inclination to reason and justice)
82|8|Into whatever form He wills He castes you
82|9|Nay! But you deny the judgment
82|10|And most surely there are guardians over you
82|11|Honourable recorders
82|12|They know what you do
82|13|Verily, the righteous are in bliss
82|14|And verily, the wicked are in burning fire
82|15|They shall enter it on the Day of Judgment
82|16|And they shall by no means be absent from it
82|17|And what will convey unto you what the Day of Judgment is
82|18|Again, what will convey unto you what the Day of Judgment Is
82|19|The day on which no soul shall control anything for another soul; and the command on that day shall be entirely Allah´s
83|1|Woe to the defrauders
83|2|Who, when they take the measure of their dues from men take it fully
83|3|But when they give by measure or weight, they are deficient
83|4|Do not these think that they shall be raised again to account
83|5|On a Mighty Day
83|6|The day on which men shall stand before the Lord of the Worlds
83|7|Nay! Most surely the record of the wicked is in Sijjin
83|8|And what will explain to you what Sijjin is
83|9|It is an inscribed Record
83|10|Woe on that day to the rejecters
83|11|Who give the lie to the Day of Judgment
83|12|And none deny it but the transgressors beyond bounds, the sinful one
83|13|When Our revelations are recited to him, he says, "Stories of those of yore
83|14|Nay! But what they used to do has become like rust upon their heart
83|15|Nay! Most surely they shall on that day be debarred (or veiled) from their Lord
83|16|Then most surely they shall enter the burning Fire
83|17|Then shall it be said, "This is what you gave the lie to
83|18|Nay! Most surely the record of the righteous shall be in Iliyin
83|19|And what will explain to you what Iliyin is
83|20|It is an inscribed Record
83|21|Those who are drawn near to Allah shall witness it
83|22|Most surely the righteous shall be in bliss
83|23|On thrones, they shall gaze
83|24|You will see in their faces the brightness of bliss
83|25|They are given to drink pure wine, sealed
83|26|The sealing of it is with musk; and for that let the aspirers aspire
83|27|And the admixture of it is a water of Tasnim
83|28|A fountain from which drink they who are nearest to Allah
83|29|Surely they who are guilty used to laugh at those who believe
83|30|And when they passed by them, they winked at one another
83|31|And when they returned to their own folk they returned exulting
83|32|And when they saw them, they said, "Most surely these are truly astray
83|33|But they were not sent to be keepers over them
83|34|This day it is the believers who shall laugh at the unbelievers
83|35|On thrones (of dignity), they will gaze
83|36|Are not the disbelievers rewarded for what they did
84|1|When the heaven is rent asunder
84|2|And gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful
84|3|And when the earth is stretched out
84|4|And casts forth what is within it, and is emptied (or clean)
84|5|And gives ear unto its Lord, and is dutiful
84|6|O man! Verily, you are toiling on towards your Lord, painfully toiling; wherefore shall you meet Him
84|7|And as for him who is given his record in his right hand
84|8|His account shall be taken with an easy reckoning
84|9|And he shall go back to his people rejoicing
84|10|But as for him who is given his book behind his back
84|11|He shall call out for destruction
84|12|But he shall broil in a blazing Fire
84|13|Verily, he was amongst his family joyful
84|14|Verily, he thought that he should never return to Allah
84|15|Nay, nay! Verily, his Lord did watch him
84|16|So I do call as witness the glow of sunset
84|17|Or the night, and its homing
84|18|Or the moon in her fullness
84|19|You shall surely travel from stage to stage
84|20|What ails them that they believe not
84|21|And, when the Quran is read to them, they fall not prostrate
84|22|On the contrary, the unbelievers reject it
84|23|But Allah knows best the (malice) that they hide
84|24|So announce to them the grievous woe
84|25|Save those who believe and work right. For them is an unfailing reward
85|1|By the heaven with its zodiacal signs
85|2|And by the Promised Day
85|3|And by the witnesses and the witnessed
85|4|Self-destroyed were the owners of the pit
85|5|The fire of which was supplied with abundant fuel
85|6|Behold, they sat over it
85|7|And they witnessed all they were doing against the believers
85|8|And they mistreated them only for their belief in Allah, the Mighty, the Praiseworthy
85|9|Whose are the kingdoms of the heavens and the earth; for Allah is Witness over all
85|10|Verily, those who persecute (or mislead or tempt) the believers, men and women, and then do not repent, for them is the penalty of Hell: they will have the torment of the burning Fire
85|11|Verily, those who believe and do right, for them are Gardens beneath which rivers flow: that is the great bliss
85|12|Verily, strong is the power of your Lord
85|13|Verily, it is He who creates and restores
85|14|And He is the Forgiving, the Loving
85|15|The Lord of the Glorious Throne
85|16|The Doer of what He will
85|17|Has there come to you the story of the Hosts
85|18|Of Pharaoh and the Thamud
85|19|Yet the unbelievers persist in rejecting (the truth)
85|20|But Allah is behind them - encompassing
85|21|Nay, this is a glorious Quran
85|22|(Inscribed) in a Preserved Tablet
86|1|By the heaven and by the night or (morning) star
86|2|And what shall make you know what the night star is
86|3|The star of piercing brightness
86|4|Verily, every soul has a guardian over it
86|5|Then let man look from what he is created
86|6|He is created from a drop emitted
86|7|Which comes out from between the loins and the breast bones
86|8|Surely, He is able to bring back (to life)
86|9|On the day when the secrets shall be tried
86|10|And man shall have neither strength nor helper
86|11|By the Firmament which returns in its rounds
86|12|And the earth with its sprouting
86|13|Verily, this is indeed a discriminating word
86|14|And it is no frivolity
86|15|As for them, they do plot a scheme
86|16|But I plot my scheme too
86|17|So give respite to the unbelievers; deal you gently with them for a while
87|1|Glorify the name of your Guardian Lord most High
87|2|Who created and makes order and proportion
87|3|Who ordains Laws and Guides
87|4|Who brings forth the pasture
87|5|Then turns it to dusky stubble
87|6|We will teach you by degrees to declare (or recite), and you shall not forget
87|7|Save what Allah wills. Verily, Lo! He knows the open and the hidden
87|8|And We will ease your way into the simple (path)
87|9|Therefore, remind men, for, verily, the reminder is useful
87|10|But he who fears will be mindful
87|11|And the wretch will avoid it
87|12|He will broil in the great Fire
87|13|Wherein he shall neither die nor live
87|14|He is successful who grows
87|15|And remembers the name of his Lord and prays
87|16|Nay! But you prefer the life of this world
87|17|Although the Hereafter is better and more lasting
87|18|Verily, this was in the former books
87|19|The books of Abraham and Moses
88|1|Has the story reached you, of the overwhelming
88|2|Some faces on that day shall be humbled
88|3|Toiling, weary
88|4|While they broil upon a burning Fire
88|5|While they drink from a boiling spring
88|6|No food shall they have save from the bitter Dhari
88|7|Which shall not nourish nor avail against hunger
88|8|Other faces on that day shall be joyful
88|9|Content with their past endeavours
88|10|In a lofty (sublime) Garden
88|11|Wherein they shall hear no foolish word
88|12|Wherein is a flowing fountain
88|13|Wherein are Thrones (of dignity) raised on high
88|14|And goblets set down ready
88|15|And cushions arranged
88|16|And carpets spread
88|17|Do they not look then at the camel, how she is created
88|18|And at the heaven how it is raised high
88|19|And at the mountains how they are set firm
88|20|And at the earth how it is spread out
88|21|Therefore, remind them: for you are only one to remind
88|22|you are not in authority over them
88|23|But such as turns his back and disbelieves
88|24|Him will Allah punish with the greatest torment
88|25|Verily, unto us is their return
88|26|And, verily, for Us is their accounting
89|1|I swear by (or call to witness) the dawn
89|2|And by the nights twice five (of pilgrimage)
89|3|And the even and the odd
89|4|And the night when it passes on
89|5|Is there not in these a lesson (evidence or admonition) for a man of understanding
89|6|Have you not seen how your Lord did with the people of A´ad
89|7|With the city of Iram of the lofty pillars
89|8|The like of which has not been created in all the land
89|9|And with the people of Thamud when they hewed the great stones in the valley
89|10|And with Pharaoh, Lord of the stakes
89|11|All these were outrageous in the land
89|12|And did multiply wickedness therein
89|13|Therefore, your Lord poured out upon them the scourge of diverse torments
89|14|Verily, your Lord is ever watchful
89|15|Now as for man, whenever his Lord tries him and honours him and grants him favour, then he says, "My Lord has honoured me
89|16|But whenever he tries him and restricts his subsistence, then he says, "My Lord despises me
89|17|Nay, nay! But you do not honour the orphan
89|18|Nor do you urge each other to feed the poor
89|19|And you devour the inheritance (of the weak) with greed
89|20|And you love wealth with an abounding love
89|21|Nay, when the earth is crushed to pieces
89|22|And your Lord comes with the angels, rank on rank
89|23|And Hell is brought near on that Day, on that Day shall man remember! But how shall the remembrance profit him
89|24|He will say, "Would that I had sent something forward for my life
89|25|But on that Day none shall punish as He punishes
89|26|And none shall be bound with bonds like his
89|27|But O, you soul in peace and fulfilment
89|28|Return unto your Lord, well pleased and well pleasing unto Him
89|29|Enter you amongst My servants
89|30|Enter you My Garden (Paradise)
90|1|I swear (or call to witness) this City (Mecca)
90|2|And you (Muhammad) are a dweller of this City
90|3|And the (mystic ties) of Parent and Child
90|4|We have surely created man in suffering (struggle, trouble, sorrow)
90|5|Does he think that none has power over him
90|6|He says, "I have squandered wealth in plenty
90|7|Does he think that no one sees him
90|8|Have We not made for him two eyes
90|9|And a tongue, and two lips
90|10|And guided him in the two highways
90|11|But he has not attempted the ascent
90|12|And what will explain to you the ascent
90|13|It is freeing captives (or prisoners, slaves, the restricted or bound)
90|14|Or feeding on the day of privation
90|15|An orphan who is a kin
90|16|Or a destitute lying in the dust (of misery)
90|17|And again (it is) to be of those who believe and encourage each other to patience, and encourage each other to mercy
90|18|These are the fellows of the right
90|19|But those who disbelieve in our signs, they are the fellows of the left
90|20|For them is the enclosing Fire
91|1|By the sun and its noonday brightness
91|2|And the moon when it follows him
91|3|And the day when it displays him
91|4|And the night when it covers him
91|5|And the wondrous structure of the heavens and Him who built it
91|6|And the earth and Who spread it
91|7|And the soul and Who fashioned it
91|8|And enlightened it with what is wrong and right for it
91|9|He indeed is successful who causes it to grow (or purifies it)
91|10|And he indeed is a failure who corrupts it
91|11|The Thamud people denied (the Messenger) in their rebellious pride (or outrage)
91|12|When the basest of them rose up
91|13|And the Messenger of Allah (Salih) said to them, "(This is) Allah´s she-camel! So give her to drink
91|14|But they called him a liar, and they ham-strung her; so their Lord destroyed them in their sins, and served them all alike
91|15|And He fears not the result thereof
92|1|By the night when it veils
92|2|And the day when it is displayed
92|3|And by (the mystery) of male and female
92|4|Verily, your efforts are diverse
92|5|But as for him who gives alms and fears Allah
92|6|And believes in goodness
92|7|We will ease his way to ease
92|8|But as for him who is niggardly and thinks himself independent (or self-sufficient)
92|9|And calls the good a lie
92|10|We will ease his way to misery (adversity)
92|11|And his wealth shall not avail him when he falls down (into hell)
92|12|Verily, it is for Us to guide
92|13|And, verily, Ours are the Latter and the Former life
92|14|Therefore, I have warned you of a Fire that flames fiercely
92|15|None shall broil thereon, but the most wretched
92|16|Who says it is a lie and turns his back
92|17|But the pious shall be kept away from it
92|18|He who gives his wealth that he may grow
92|19|And who gives no favour expecting a return
92|20|But only desiring the face of his Lord Most High
92|21|In the end he shall be well fulfilled
93|1|By the glorious morning light
93|2|And the night when it is still
93|3|Your Lord has not forsaken you (Muhammad), nor is displeased with you
93|4|And surely the Hereafter is better for you than the present
93|5|And in the end your Lord will give you, and you shall be well pleased
93|6|Did He not find you an orphan, and give you protection
93|7|And find you wandering (or astray), and guide you
93|8|And find you in need, and enriched you (or made you independent)
93|9|Therefore, the orphan oppress him not
93|10|Nor the beggar (or petitioner) drive away
93|11|And as for the favour of your Lord, discourse (proclaim) thereof
94|1|Have We not expanded for you your breast
94|2|And set down from you your load
94|3|Which galled your back
94|4|And exalted for you your renown
94|5|Verily, with difficulty comes ease
94|6|Verily, with difficulty comes ease
94|7|So when you are at relieved, then still toil
94|8|And to your Lord turn all your yearning (or attention)
95|1|By the Fig and the Olive
95|2|And by Mount Sinai
95|3|And by this Safe City
95|4|Surely, We have created man in the best of moulds
95|5|Then We reduced him to the lowest of the low
95|6|Save those who believe and act right; for theirs is a reward unfailing
95|7|But what shall make you call the judgment after this a lie
95|8|Is not Allah the most wise (just or conclusive) of judges
96|1|READ (or proclaim), in the name of your Lord! Who created
96|2|Created man from a clot
96|3|Read (or proclaim), for your Lord is most Bountiful
96|4|Who teaches by the pen
96|5|Taught man what he did not know
96|6|Nay, verily, man is indeed rebellious
96|7|In that he thinks himself independent (or self-sufficient or rich)
96|8|Verily, unto your Lord is the return
96|9|Have you considered him who forbids
96|10|A servant when he prays
96|11|Have you considered if he were in guidance
96|12|Or bade piety
96|13|Have you considered if he denied the truth, and turned his back
96|14|Does he not know that Allah can see
96|15|Nay, surely, if he does not desist, We will drag him by the forelock
96|16|The lying sinful forelock
96|17|So let him call his council (or comrades)
96|18|We will call the guards of Hell
96|19|Nay, obey him not, but adore and draw nigh (unto Allah)
97|1|Verily, We sent it (the Quran) down on the Night of Power
97|2|And what shall make you know what the Night of Power is
97|3|The Night of Power is better than a thousand months
97|4|The angels and the Spirit descend therein, by the permission of their Lord with every decree
97|5|Peace it is until the rising of the dawn
98|1|Those of the People of the Book and the idolaters who disbelieve did not fall away until there came to them the Manifest Sign
98|2|A Messenger from Allah reading pure pages
98|3|Wherein are right scriptures
98|4|Nor did those who were given the Book divide into sects until after there came to them the Manifest Sign
98|5|But they were bidden nothing but to worship Allah, being sincere in religion unto Him as ´Hanifs´, and to be steadfast in prayer, and to give alms: for that is the true religion
98|6|Verily, those who disbelieve amongst the people of the Book and the idolaters shall be in the fire of hell, to dwell therein for aye; they are wretched creatures
98|7|Verily, those who believe and act aright, they are the best of creatures
98|8|Their reward with their Lord is Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; Allah shall be well pleased with them, and they with Him! That is for him who fears his Lord
99|1|When the earth shall be shaken with its quaking
99|2|And the earth shall bring forth her burdens
99|3|And man shall say, "What ails her
99|4|On that day she shall tell her tidings
99|5|Because your Lord inspires her
99|6|On the day when men shall come up in separate bands to show their works
99|7|And he who does the weight of an atom of good shall see it then
99|8|And he who does the weight of an atom of evil shall see it
100|1|By the snorting chargers
100|2|And those who strike fire with their hoofs
100|3|And those who make incursions in the morning
100|4|And raise up dust therein
100|5|And cleave through a host therein
100|6|Verily, man is to his Lord ungrateful
100|7|And, verily, he is a witness of that
100|8|Verily, he is keen in his love of wealth
100|9|Does he not know when the tombs are exposed
100|10|And what is in the breasts is brought to light
100|11|Verily, your Lord upon that day indeed is well aware
101|1|The calamity
101|2|What is the calamity
101|3|And what will convey to you what the calamity is
101|4|The day when men shall be like scattered moths
101|5|And the mountains shall be like flocks of carded wool
101|6|And as for him whose balance is heavy
101|7|He shall be in a well-pleasing life
101|8|But as for him whose balance is light
101|9|His mother will be the Bereft and Hungry One
101|10|And who shall convey to you what she is
101|11|A raging fire
102|1|The rivalry in worldly increase deludes you
102|2|Till you visit the graves
102|3|Nay! In the end you shall know
102|4|And again Nay! In the end you shall know
102|5|Nay! Did you but know with certain knowledge
102|6|You shall surely see hell
102|7|And again you shall surely see it with an eye of certainty
102|8|Then you shall surely be asked about pleasure
103|1|By the declining day
103|2|Verily, man is in a state of loss
103|3|Save those who believe and do good works, and bid each other to truth, and bid each other endurance
104|1|Woe to every slanderous scandal-monger and backbiter
104|2|Who collects wealth and counts it
104|3|He thinks that his wealth can immortalize him
104|4|Not so! He shall be hurled into El´Hutamah
104|5|Ah, what shall make you understand what El´Hutamah is
104|6|The Fire by Allah kindled
104|7|Which leaps into the heart
104|8|Lo! It closes in as a vault on them
104|9|In outstretched columns
105|1|See you not how your Lord dealt with the people of the elephant
105|2|Did He not make their stratagem lead them astray
105|3|And sent down on them birds in flocks
105|4|To pelt them with stones of baked clay
105|5|And make them like stalks left by herbage eaten down
106|1|For the taming (civilizing) of the Qureysh
106|2|Their covenant covers their caravans in winter and summer
106|3|So let them serve the Lord of this house
106|4|Who feeds them against hunger, and makes them safe against fear
107|1|Have you considered him who calls the judgment (or Religion) a lie
107|2|He it is who pushes the orphan away
107|3|And urges not (others) to feed the needy
107|4|But woe to those who pray
107|5|But are careless in their prayers
107|6|Who pretend for show
107|7|Yet withhold small kindnesses (or necessaries)
108|1|Verily, We have given you (Muhammad) El Kauthar (The Fountain of Abundance)
108|2|So pray to your Lord and sacrifice
108|3|Verily, he who insults you shall be issueless (cut off)
109|1|Say, "O you faithless
109|2|I do not serve what you serve
109|3|Nor will you serve what I serve
109|4|Nor will I serve what you serve
109|5|Nor will you serve what I serve
109|6|To you your Way and to me my Way
110|1|When there comes Allah´s help and victory
110|2|And you shall see men enter into Allah´s religion in crowds
110|3|Then celebrate the praises of your Lord, and ask forgiveness of Him, verily, He is Relenting
111|1|Perish shall the hands of The Father of Flame, and he shall perish
111|2|His wealth shall not avail him, nor what he has gained
111|3|He shall soon broil in a Fire that flames
111|4|And his wife shall carry the wood as fuel
111|5|On her own neck a cord of palm fibres
112|1|Say, "He is Allah, the One and Only
112|2|Allah the Absolute, on whom all things depend, besought by all
112|3|He begets not and is not begotten
112|4|Nor is there like unto Him any one
113|1|Say, "I seek refuge in the Lord of the Dawn
113|2|From the evil of created things
113|3|And from the evil of the night when it cometh on
113|4|And from the evil of those who practice secret arts
113|5|And from the evil of the envious when he envies
114|1|Say, "I seek refuge in the Lord and Cherisher of mankind
114|2|The King (or Ruler) of mankind
114|3|The God (or Judge) of mankind
114|4|From the mischief of the Whisperer, who slinks off
114|5|Who whispers into the heart of men
114|6|From among Jinn and Men
