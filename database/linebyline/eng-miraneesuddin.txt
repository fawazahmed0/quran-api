In the Name of Allah, the Beneficent, The Merciful
Praise is due only for Allah , the Fosterer of the worlds
the Beneficent, the Merciful
the Master of the day of judgment
You alone do we serve and (from) You alone do we seek help
Guide us to the straight path
the path of those, on whom You have bestowed favours, not (the path of those), upon whom is Your anger, nor of those who are astray
Alif Laam Miim
This is the book in which there is nothing doubtful, (there is) guidance (in it) for those who guard (against evil)
who believe* in the unseen and establish worship (salat) and spend from that which We have provided for them. * Believe (Momin)
and who believe in that which is sent down to you and that which was sent down before you, and are certain about the hereafter $ . $ Life after death
Those are on guidance from their Fosterer and those are the persons who are successful
For those who do not believe, it is the same to them, whether you warn them or do not warn them they will certainly not believe
Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearings, and upon their eyes is a covering, and for them there is a great punishment
And among mankind are those who say, "We believe in Allah and in the period hereafter," but they are not with the believers # . # Those who act like Muslims but do not believe, are hypocrites (Munafiqeen)
They (presume to) deceive Allah and those who believe, but they do not deceive anyone except themselves, yet they do not perceive
In their hearts is a disease, so Allah has increased their disease, and there is a painful punishment for the because they were deniers
And when it is said to them, "Do not cause corruption in the earth," they say, "We are but reformers
Beware! they are certainly the corrupt, but they do not perceive
And when it is said to them, "Believe as (other) people believe," they say, "What ! should we believe as the fools believe?' Beware! they are certainly the fools but they do not know
And when they meet those who believe they say, "We believe," but when they are alone with their devils (evil ones), they say, "We are certainly with you, we were just mocking
Allah mocks at them and lets them go, blindly wandering on in their rebellion
Those are the persons who purchase error at the cost of guidance, so their commerce is of no gain, and they do not receive guidance
Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire, so when it enlightened that which was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darkness (so that) they do not see
deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they cannot return (to the light)
Or like a rainstorm from the sky, in which is darkness and thunder and lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears (because of) the fear of death from the thunder-claps, and Allah encompasses the infidels *. *Those who reject Divine Communications (Kafir)
The lightning almost snatches away their sight, whenever it shines on them they walk therein, and when it darkens over them they stand still. And had Allah willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight, Allah certainly has power over everything
O mankind ! serve your Fosterer Who created you and those before you, so that you may save yourselves (from the punishment)
Who made the earth a spreading for you, and the sky, a structure (above you); and sent down water from the sky so as to bring out fruits through it as sustenance for you; so do not set up equals for Allah while you know
And if you are in doubt concerning (the Quran) which We have sent down to Our servant, then bring a chapter like it and call your witnesses besides Allah, if you are truthful
But if you do not do it, and you will never do it, then be on your guard against the fire prepared for the infidels whose fuel will be human beings and stones
And convey the good news to those who believe and do righteous works, that for them there will be gardens $ beneath which rivers flow, whenever they will be fed from them with fruits as food, they will say, "This is that which was provided to us before," and they will be given the like of it, and for them there will be pure mates (spouses) therein and therein they shall stay. $ Paradise
Allah is certainly not ashamed to set forth the similitude of a fly or something above that, then as for those who believe they know that it is the truth from their Fosterer and as for those who do not believe, they say, "What is it that Allah intends by this similitude?" He misleads many with it and He guides many with it, but He does not mislead anyone with it except the transgressors *, * Those who exceed the limits ( fasiqeen)
those who break the agreement of Allah after its establishment and cut off that which Allah has ordered to be joined and cause corruption in the earth, those are the persons who are the losers
How is it, that you do not believe in Allah, when you were dead then He gave you life, then He will cause you to die then bring you to life again, then to Him you will return
He it is Who has created for you, all that is in the earth. Moreover He set the balance towards the sky, then He balanced them (into) seven skies (higher levels) and He is the Knower of everything (Omniscient)
And when your Fosterer said to the angels , "I am going to make a successor in the earth." They said, "Are you going to make (him, the successor) in it, who would act corruptly in it and shed blood, when we glorify You by praising You and exalt Your Holiness?" He (Allah) replied, "I know that which you do not know
And He taught Adam all names $, then He presented them (things) before the angels and said, "Inform Me of the names of these if you are right (in your objection to Adam being made the successor on earth)." $ A name normally indicates the purpose or use of a thing
They (angels) replied, "Glory be to You, we do not have knowledge except of that which You taught us. You are certainly the Knowing, the Wise
He (Allah) said, "O Adam ! inform them of the names of these (things)," so when the (angels) were informed of the names of those (things), He said, "Did I not tell you, that I know the unseen of the skies and the earth and I know that which you manifest and that which you hide?" which you manifest and that which you hide
And when We (Allah) said to the angels, "Bow down before Adam," they bowed own except Iblis*, he refused and considered himself great and (thus) became one of the infidels. * The devil associated with Adam
And We said, "O Adam ! you and your wife, dwell in the garden, and eat from it freely (from) wherever you will, but do not go near this tree, because you will become one of those who are unjust
But the devil made them slip from it and caused them both to be sent out from that (state) in which they were. And We said, "Go down, some of you will be the enemies of others, and in the earth is the dwelling place for you and provision till a time
Then Adam received (some) words from his Fosterer, because He turned towards him (mercifully), He is certainly the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful
We said, "All of you go down from here, so whenever guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, then (as a result of this) there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve
And those who do not believe and deny Our signs , those will be the inhabitants of the fire, in it they will stay
O children of Israel ! remember My favour with which I favoured you and fulfill (your) agreement with Me, I will fulfill (My) agreement with you and then fear Me alone
And believe in the (Quran) which I have sent down confirming that (book) which is with you and do not be the first in not believing in it, and do not sell My signs for a small price and fear Me alone
And do not cover truth with falsehood nor hide the truth while you know
And establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and bow down with those who bow down
What ! you enjoin people to be virtuous and forget it yourselves while you read the book, then have you no sense
And seek help through patience and worship (salat) and this is certainly difficult except for the humble ones
those who expect that they will meet their Fosterer and that to Him they will return
O children of Israel ! remember My favour with which I favoured you and that I preferably favoured you (compared to others in the) worlds
And guard yourselves against a day when no requital* will be accepted from one person for another in anything nor will recommendation be accepted for him nor will compensation be taken from him nor will they be helped. * Repayment for good or evil, reward or punishment
And (remember) when We delivered you from the people of Firawn who subjected you to severe punishment, they slew your sons and left your women alive and in that there was a great trial from your Fosterer
and when We parted the sea for you and delivered you and drowned the people of Firawn while you were seeing
And when We appointed for Musa forty nights then you took the calf (for worship) after he (had gone) and you were unjust
then We pardoned you even after that so that you should be grateful
And when We gave Musa the book (prescribed laws) and the distinction (between right and wrong) so that you may receive guidance
and when Musa said to his people, "O my people ! you have certainly been unjust to yourselves by taking the calf (for worship) so turn towards your Purifier then kill yourselves, this is better for you (than calf worship), in the sight of your Purifier," then He turned to you (mercifully), He is certainly the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful
And when you said, "O Musa ! We will never believe in you till we see Allah openly," so you were caught (by the) thunder-bolt while you were seeing
then We raised you after your death so that you should be grateful
And We provided shade over you (through) the clouds and sent down manna and quails over you, "Eat of the good things which We have provided for you." And they did not harm Us but they were unjust to themselves
And when We said, "Enter this city and eat from it freely from wherever you like and enter the gate prostrating and say: Put down from us our heavy burdens, We will forgive you your mistakes and give more to the doers of good
then those who were unjust, changed the word to other than what was said to them. So We sent down over those who were unjust punishment from the sky, because they were transgressors. (R)
And when Musa asked for water for his people, We said, "Strike the (porous) rock with your staff." So twelve springs gushed out from it. All persons came to know their drinking place. "Eat and drink from the provision of Allah but do not spread disturbance in the earth, being corrupt
And when you said, "O Musa ! we cannot be patient over one food, therefore pray to your Fosterer on our behalf (and ask Him) to bring out for us from that which the earth grows of its herbs, and its cucumbers and its garlic’s and its lentils and its onions." He said, "What ! do you want to ex-change that which is good for that which is worse? Go down to the city (Egypt) you will certainly have what you ask for." And disgrace and wretchedness were made to strike them and they became deserving of the anger of Allah. That was because they did not believe in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without having the right to do so. That was because of their disobedience and they were the persons who exceeded the limits
Those who believe (in the Quran) and those who are Jews and the Christians and the Sabaeans, whoever believes in Allah and the period hereafter and does righteous work, then certainly there is a reward for them with their Fosterer and there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve
And when We took a pledge from you (children of Israel) and raised the mountain above you (saying), "Hold with strength the (Torah) which We have given you and remember that which is in it so that you may guard (against evil and the consequent punishment)
then after that you turned (away from the contract). And were it not for the grace of Allah on you and His mercy, you would have been among the losers
And you surely know those among you who exceeded the limits of the Sabbath, so We said to them, "Be apes, looked down upon
So We made this (event) an exemplary punishment for those who were in front of them (witnessing it) and those who came after them and an admonition * for those who guard (against evil). * Warning, advice
And when Musa said to his people, "Allah commands you that you should certainly slaughter a cow. "They remarked, "Are you taking us as a joke?" He (Musa) said, "I seek the protection of Allah from my being one among the ignorant
They said, "Call on your Fosterer on our behalf to make clear to us what this (cow) is." He (Musa) replied, "He says that it is a cow which is neither old nor (very) young, middle aged between those two, so do what you are ordered to do
They said, "Call on your Fosterer on our behalf to make clear to us, what should be its colour." Musa answered, "He says it should be a yellow coloured cow, its colour should be intensely yellow, delighting those who look at it
They said, "Call on your Fosterer on our behalf to make clear to us, what is it (exactly), cows are certainly alike to us, and if Allah wills, we shall certainly be guided
(Musa) said, "He says it must be a cow unyoked, it does not plough the land nor does it irrigate the field, sound without (even) a mark on it." They said, "Now you have brought the truth," So they slaughtered it, while they were more close to, not doing it
And when you killed a person, then you disagreed about it, and Allah (was) to bring out that which you were hiding
so We said, "Strike the (dead man) with part of the (flesh of the slain cow)," like that Allah brings to life the dead and shows you His signs that you may understand *. *The dead man revealed the name of the murderer
Then your hearts hardened even after that, so they became like rocks, or even greater in hardness. For certainly, in rocks are those through which rivers gush out and certainly in them are those which split asunder so that water comes out of them, and certainly in them are those which fall down due to the fear of Allah . And Allah is not unaware of what you do
Are you then hopeful that they will believe for your sake? And indeed a party from among them heard the word of Allah, then after understanding it, they altered it, and they know (this)
And when they meet those who believe they say, "We believe," but when alone, some of them say to others, "Do you acquaint them with that which Allah has opened (revealed) to you, that they may argue with you concerning it before your Fosterer, then have you no sense
Do they not know that Allah knows that which they hide and that which they proclaim
And among them are the unlettered who do not (even) know (what is written in) the book (their religion is nothing) but hearsay (idle tales or lies) and they do nothing but guess
Therefore, sorrowful is the state of those who write the book with their hands, then say, "This is from Allah," so as to sell it for a small price. So sorrowful is their state for what their hands write and sorrowful is their state for what they earn
And they say, "The fire will not touch us except for a counted number of days." Say, "Have you made an agreement with Allah? Then Allah never goes against His agreement. Or do you say about Allah that which you do not know
Why not ! whoever earns evil and is encompassed by his misdeeds, then those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay in it
And those who believe and do righteous works, those are the inhabitants of the garden, they will stay therein
And when We took a pledge from the children of Israel, "Do not serve anyone except Allah and be good to parents and relatives and orphans and the poor and talk to mankind in a nice manner and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat)," then you turned back except a few among you and you turned away
And when We took a pledge from you, "Do not shed blood (among) yourselves and do not drive out your people from your houses, "then you agreed to this while you (yourselves) were witnesses
Then you are the persons who kill your own people and drive out a party of your people from their houses, supporting one another against them, in sin and transgression, and if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, whereas their very driving out was unlawful for you. Do you then believe in one part of the book and reject the other part? Then what is the reward of one who does like that among you, except disgrace in the life of this world? And on the day of resurrection * they will be sent towards a severe punishment, and Allah is not unaware of what you do. * The rising of the dead for judgment of deeds and subsequent reward or punishment
Those are the persons who purchase the life of this world at the cost of the (life) of the hereafter, so their punishment will not be lightened nor will they be helped. (R)
And We gave Musa the book (prescribed law), and after him We followed him up with (other) messengers. And We gave to Isa, the son of Maryam, clear proofs and strengthened him with the holy spirit. What ! whenever there came to you a messenger with that which you did not desire, you considered yourselves great, so some you denied and others you killed
And (they) say, "Our hearts are coverings," No ! Allah has cursed them because of their infidelity, so little it is that they believe
And when there came to them a book from Allah confirming that which is with them, though earlier they were seeking a victory over those who did not believe, but when there came to them that which they have recognized, they rejected it, so the curse of Allah is on the infidels
Evil is that for which they sell themselves, by rejecting that which Allah has sent down, being oppressed that Allah sends down from His grace (the book) on whom He wills from among His servants. Therefore they became deserving of anger upon anger, and for the infidels there is a disgraceful punishment
And when it is said to them, "Believe in that which Allah has sent down," they say, "We believe in that which was sent down upon us." And they do not believe in that which comes after it, though it is the truth, confirming that which is with them. Say, "Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah earlier, if you were believers?" " And they do not believe in that which comes after it, though it is the truth, confirming that which is with them. Say, "Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah earlier, if you were believers
And Musa had come to you with clear proofs, then after him you took the calf (for worship) and you were unjust
And when We took a pledge from you and raised the mountain above you (saying), "Hold with strength that which We have given you and listen." They said, "We hear and we disobey." And they were made to drink into their hearts (the worship of) the calf because of their infidelity. Say, "Evil is that which your belief enjoins you, if you are believers
Say, "If the home of the hereafter with Allah, is exclusively for you to the exclusion of all other human beings, then desire for death, if you are truthful
And they will never desire for it because of that which their hands have sent before. And Allah knows those who are unjust
And you will definitely find them the greediest among human beings for life and (also) among those who associate partners with Allah *, each one of them loves that he should be granted to live for thousand years, but to live (so long) would by no means remove him from the punishment, and Allah is the Seer of what they do. * The polytheists (Mushrikeen)
Say, "Whoever is an enemy of Jibreel, because he brought the (Quranic revelation) down on your heart by the order of Allah, confirming those (earlier books) which were before it, and (as) a guidance and good news for the believers
whoever is an enemy of Allah and His angels and His messengers and Jibreel and Mikaal, then Allah is certainly the enemy of the infidels
And We have surely sent down clear signs towards you and only the transgressors do not believe in them
What! whenever they agreed for an agreement, a party of them cast it aside. No ! most of them do not believe
And when a messenger came to them from Allah, confirming that which was with them, a party of those who were given the book, cast the book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know
and followed that which the devils read (and taught) against the (miraculous) power of Sulaiman. And Sulaiman did not reject but the devils rejected, teaching people magic and that which was sent down upon the two angels Harut and Marut at Babel. And they (the two angels) did not teach anyone until they said, "We are only a trial, so do not be infidels." Then they learnt from these two (angels) that which caused division between a man and his wife, and they did not harm anyone with it except with the permission of Allah; and they learnt that which harmed them and not that which profited them. And they surely knew that whoever purchased it, he had no share for himself in the hereafter. And evil was the price for which they sold themselves, had they but known
And had they believed and guarded (against evil), then reward from Allah would have certainly been better, had they but known
O you who believe ! do not say, "Listen to us ," but say, "Look at us and listen," and for the infidels there is a painful punishment
Neither those who are infidels from among the owners of the book nor the polytheists like that any good should be sent down upon you from your Fosterer, but Allah chooses for His mercy whomever He wills and Allah is the Possessor of great grace
Whatever We abolish from Our signs (Divine revelations) or cause to be forgotten, We bring (something) better than it or like it. Did you not know that Allah has power over everything
Did you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, and (that), besides Allah, there is neither a guardian nor a helper for you
Do you intend to question your messenger as Musa was questioned earlier? And anyone who seeks to exchange belief for infidelity, he has surely gone astray from the balanced way
Many of the owners of the book wish to turn you to infidelity after your belief, out of envy on their part (and) after the truth having become clear to them, so pardon and overlook till Allah (comes out ) with His command (in this regard), Allah certainly has power over everything
And establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and whatever good you send before for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, Allah is certainly the Seer of what you do
And they say, "No one can ever enter the garden except he who is a Jew or a Christian." This is their desire, say, "Bring your proof if you are truthful
Why not ! whoever submits himself to Allah and he is a doer of good, then for him, his reward is with his Fosterer, and there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve
And the Jews say, "The Christians are on nothing." And the Christians say, "The Jews are on nothing," and they read the book. Thus, similar to their saying is the saying of those who have no knowledge, therefore Allah will judge between them on the day of resurrection concerning that in which they differ
And who is more unjust than one who prevents (people from) the mosques of Allah, that His name should be remembered in them and strives to ruin them. (In fact) it was not fit for them to enter the (mosques) except in fear. There is disgrace for them in the world and there is a great punishment for them in the hereafter
And Allah's is the east and the west, so in which ever direction you turn, then there (you have ) Allah's Person (Attention). Allah is certainly Omnipresent, Knowing
And they say, "Allah has taken a son for Himself," Glory be to Him (He is far above this). No ! whatever is in the skies and the earth is His, all are obedient to Him
The Originator of the skies and the earth, and when He decrees an affair, then He says to it only, "BE," so it is
And those who have no knowledge say, "Why does Allah not speak to us or there (does not) come to us a sign?" Thus did those before them say, their sayings are similar, their hearts are alike. We have surely made the signs clear for a people who are certain
We have certainly sent you with the truth, as a conveyer of good news and a warner, and you will not be questioned about the inhabitants of the hell fire
And the Jews will never be pleased with you nor the Christians till you follow their (dictated) religion. Say, "Guidance of Allah is certainly the guidance," And if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you will have from Allah, neither a guardian nor a helper
Those to whom We have given the book read (study to implement) it, as it deserves to be read, those believe in it. And whoever does not believe in it, then those are the persons who are the losers
O children of Israel ! remember My favour with which I favoured you and that I preferably favoured you (compared to others in) the worlds
And guard yourselves against a day when no requital will be accepted from on person for another in anything nor will compensation be accepted from him nor will recommendation be of benefit to him nor will they be helped
And when his Fosterer tried Ibrahim with (some) statements (commands), he fulfilled them. He (Allah) said, "I will make you a leader of mankind." He (Ibrahim) said, "And from my offspring?" He (Allah) replied, "My agreement does not include the unjust
And when We made the house (Kaaba) a resort for human beings and a (place of) security (We ordered), "And take from the place where Ibrahim stood, a place for (offering) worship (salat)." And We made an agreement with Ibrahim and Ismael that they should clean My house for those who go around (it) and those who stay therein for devotion and those who bow down and prostrate
And when Ibrahim said, "My Fosterer ! make this a city of security and provide its people with fruits, those who believe from among them in Allah and the period hereafter." He (Allah) replied, "And whoever does not believe, I will provide for him (too), a little (enjoyment), then I will drive him towards the punishment of fire, and it is an evil destination
And when Ibrahim was raising the foundations of the house with Ismael (he prayed), "Our Fosterer ! accept from us, You are certainly the Hearing, the Knowing
Our Fosterer ! and make us submissive to You and from our descendants a community submissive to You and show us our ways (of devotion to You) and turn to us (mercifully), You are certainly the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful
Our Fosterer ! and raise in them a messenger from among them who would read to them Your signs (that is practically demonstrate the Quran) and teach them the book (law) and wisdom (its interpretation) and purify them. You are certainly the Mighty, the Wise
And who forsakes the religion (dictated by) Ibrahim except he who fools himself? And surely, We selected him in this world, and in the hereafter he will certainly be among the righteous
When his Fosterer said to him (Ibrahim), "Submit." He replied, "I submit before the Fosterer of the worlds." ed, "I submit before the Fosterer of the worlds
And Ibrahim enjoined (the same) to his sons and Yaqub too, "O my sons ! certainly, Allah has selected for you the religion (Islam) so do not die unless you are Muslims
Or were you present (as a witness) when death came to Yaqub, when he said to his sons, "What will you serve after me?" They replied, "We will serve your God, and the God of your fathers: Ibrahim and Ismael and Ishaq, One God, and we are those who submit to Him (as Muslims)
That was a community which has passed away, for them is that which they earned, and for you that which you earn, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do
And they say, "Be Jews or Christians, you will receive guidance." Say, "No ! (we will follow the) religion (dictated by) Ibrahim the upright and he was not of the polytheists
Say, "We believe in Allah and that which is sent down to us (Quran) and that which was sent down to Ibrahim and Ismael and Ishaq and Yaqub and the tribes and that which was given to Musa and Isa and that which was given to (other) prophets from their Fosterer, we do not make any distinction between any of them and we submit to Him (as Muslims)
Then if they believe in the manner in which you believe then surely they have received guidance, but if they turn away, then they are only in opposition, so Allah will suffice you against them and He is the Hearing, the Knowing
Colour of Allah, and who is better than Allah in colouring And we are His servants (worshippers)
Say, "Do you dispute with us concerning Allah, when He is our Fosterer and your Fosterer, and for us are our deeds and for you your deeds, and we are exclusively His
Or do you say that Ibrahim and Ismael and Ishaq and Yaqub and the tribes were Jews or Christians?" Say, "Do you know better or Allah?" And who is more unjust then one who hides a testimony which he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do
That was a community which has passed away, for them is that which they earned, and for you that which you earn, and you will not be questioned about what they used to do
The foolish among the people will say, "What has turned them from their Qiblah * towards which they used to (face)?" say "The east and the west are Allah's, He guides whom He wills, towards the straight path." *Direction in which Muslims are required to face during Worship (salat)
And thus We have made you a middle community (probably with respect to location and time) that you may be witnesses (by keeping an eye) on mankind and the messenger may be a witness ( by keeping an eye) on you. And We had appointed the Qiblah, towards which you used to (turn earlier), only to know (distinguish) one who follows the messenger, from one who turns away on his heels. And that was a great (test) except for those whom Allah had guided, and Allah will not waste your belief, Allah is certainly full of pity for human beings, Merciful
We have surely seen you turning your face towards the sky, therefore We will definitely turn you towards the Qiblah with which you are pleased. So turn your face towards the direction of the Sacred Mosque (Kaaba) and wherever you are then turn your faces in that direction. And those who have been given the book, certainly know that this is the truth from their Fosterer, and Allah is not unaware of what they do
And even if you come with all signs, to those who have been given the book, they will not follow your Qiblah, nor will you be the followers of their Qiblah, nor some of them will be the followers of the Qiblah of others. And if you follow their desires after the knowledge that has come to you, then you would certainly be of those who are unjust
Those to whom We have given the book, recognise him as they recognise their sons, and a group from among them certainly hide the truth while they know. have given the book, recognise him as they recognise their sons, and a group from among them certainly hide the truth while they know
The truth (is) from your Fosterer, so do not be among those who doubt
And for everyone there is a direction towards which he turns, so hasten towards good; wherever you are Allah will bring you all together, Allah certainly has power over everything
And from whichever place you come forth, then turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and it is certainly the truth from your Fosterer and Allah is not unaware of what you do
And from whichever place you come forth, then turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque, and in whichever place you are then turn your faces towards it, so that people may not have (any point of) dispute against you, except those who are unjust among them, so do not fear them but fear Me so that I may complete My favour on you and that you may receive guidance
Like that, We have sent among you a messenger from among you, who reads to you Our signs ( that is, practically demonstrate the Quran) and purifies you and teaches you the book and the wisdom and teaches you that which you did not know
So remember Me I will remember you and be grateful to Me and do not be ungrateful to Me
O you who believe ! seek help through patience and worship (salat), Allah is certainly with the patient
And do not say for those who are slain in the way of Allah (that they are) dead. No! they are alive but you do not perceive
And We will definitely test you with something of fear and hunger and loss in wealth and life and fruits (results of efforts) and convey good news to the patient
who, when a disaster falls on them, say, "We are Allah's and we have to return to Him
Those are the persons over whom are blessings from their Fosterer with (His) mercy, and those are the persons who receive guidance
The (hills of ) Safa and Marwa are certainly among the symbols of Allah, so whoever is on a pilgrimage (Hajj) to the house (Kaaba) or pays a visit (Umrah) there is no sin on him if he goes around both of them, and whoever does good willingly, then Allah is certainly One Who acknowledges, the Knower
Those who hide that which We have sent down ( in the form ) of clear proofs and guidance, after what We had made clear for the human beings in the book, they are certainly the persons whom Allah curses and (also) curse them, those who curse
except those who repent and amend and make clear ( the truth which they were hiding). Then those are the persons towards whom I turn (mercifully) and I am the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful
Those who did not believe and died while they were infidels, they are certainly the persons over whom is the curse of Allah and the angels and the human beings combined
they will stay therein, their punishment will not be lightened over them nor will they be given time
And your God is One God, there is no god except Him, the Beneficent, the Merciful
In the creation of the skies (heavenly bodies) and the earth, and in the successive alternation of the night and the day, and in the ships that sail in the sea with that which profits human beings, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky, then gives life with it to the earth after its death, and in the spreading in it of every (kind of) animal, and the changing if the winds and the clouds that are subject serve between the sky and the earth, there are certainly signs for people who have sense. for people who have sense
And among human beings are those who take (objects) besides Allah, (as His) equals, they loge them as they should have loved Allah, but those who believe are strongest in love for Allah. Oh ! those who are unjust will realize when they see the punishment, that power is wholly Allah's and that Allah is severe in punishment
When they see the punishment, those who were followed will disown those who followed (them) and their relations with them will be cut off

Those who hide that which Allah has sent down of the book and take for it a small price, those are certainly the persons who do not swallow into their stomachs (anything) but fire, and Allah will not speak to them on the day of resurrection nor will He purify them and for them there will be a painful punishment
Those are the persons who purchase error at the cost of guidance and punishment at the cost of protective forgiveness. Then, what patience they (must) have over the fire

And do not be in contact with them (wives) when you devotedly (remain) in the mosques (for Itikaf). These are the limits (imposed by) Allah, so do not go near them.

And accomplish the pilgrimage (Hajj) and the visit (Umrah) for (the sake of) Allah, but if you are prevented, then (send) whatever offering is easy to obtain and do not shave your heads until the offering reaches its destination, and whoever among you is sick or has an ailment of the head, then (he should effect a) ransom by fasting or (giving) charity or sacrificing. But when you are safe, then whoever profits by combining the Umrah with the Hajj, then (he should bring with him) whatever offering is easy to obtain, but one who cannot find (anything for offering) should then fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when you return, these (make) ten (days) complete.

Then when he had crossed (the river) with those who believed with him, they said, "Today we do not have power against Jalut and his forces." Those who expected that they would meet Allah, said, "How often has a small party over come a party consisting of many people by the order of Allah, and Allah is with those who are patient
And when they went out against Jalut and his forces, they prayed, "Our Fosterer ! pour on us patience and make our steps firm and help us against the people who are infidels
So they defeated them by Allah's order, and Dawood killed Jalut, and Allah gave him authority and wisdom and taught him of that which He willed. And had Allah not repelled some human beings with others, the earth would have surely been in a state of corruption, but Allah is Gracious to the worlds
These are the signs of Allah, We read them to you with truth and you are certainly of the messengers
Those messengers, We had made some to excel others. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke and some of them He exalted in degrees. And We gave to Isa, the son of Maryam, clear proofs and strengthened him with the holy spirit. And had Allah willed those after them would not have fought one with another after clear proofs that had come to them, but they disagreed.

And Allah does not guide a people who are unjust
Or (did you not consider one) like him who passed over a town which had fallen down on its roofs, he said, "How will this be brought (back) to life by Allah after its death?"

He replied, "I stayed for a day or part of a day."

And if (the debtor) is in difficulty, then wait till it is easy (for him to pay back your loan) and if you (convert) it as charity, it will be better for you if you knew
And guard (yourselves against) a day in which you will be returned to Allah, then every soul will be paid back in full that which it had earned, and injustice will not be done to them
O you who believe ! when you contract a loan for a fixed term then write it down and let a writer write it down between you with fairness and the writer should not refuse to write, as Allah has taught him so he shall write; and let him who owes the loan dictate and he should fear Allah, his Fosterer, and not reduce anything from it. And if he who owes the loan is of poor understanding or weak or unable to dictate it himself, then let his guardian dictate with fairness. And call in two witnesses from among your men, but if two men are not available then one man and two women from among those whom you choose as witnesses, so that if one (woman) errs, then the other (woman) may remind her. And the witnesses must not refuse when they are called. And do not be averse to writing down the (loan contract), whether the (amount) is small or large, along with its time (of payment); that is (an act of ) justice with Allah and (good for) the establishment of testimony and the nearest(way) for avoiding doubt (in future), except when it is ready merchandise which you transact among yourselves from hand to hand, then (in that case) there is no sin on you if you do not write it down, and have witnesses when you trade. And do not harm the writer or the witness, and if you do (so) then it will certainly be a transgression on your (part) and fear Allah; and Allah teaches you and Allah is the Knower of everything
And if you are on a journey and you do not find a writer (for the contract) then a security may be taken into possession, then if one of you entrusts another (with something) then he who is entrusted should deliver that which is entrusted to him and let him fear Allah, his Fosterer; and do not hide the testimony and one who hides it then his heart is certainly sinful; and Allah is the Knower of what you do
Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is Allah's. And whether you manifest that which is in your souls or hide it, Allah will call you to account for it, then He will protectively forgive whom He wills and will punish whom He wills and Allah has power over everything
The messenger believes in that which is sent down to him from his Fosterer, along with the believers, (they) all believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers: We make no difference between any of His messengers and they say, "We hear and we obey, (we seek) Your protective forgiveness our Fosterer, and towards You is the destination
Allah does not task a soul except to its capacity, for it, is (the benefit of )what it has earned and against it, is (the harm of) what it has earned. Our Fosterer ! do not catch us if we forget or make a mistake. Our Fosterer ! and do not lay on us a burden like the one which was laid by You on those before us. Our Fosterer ! and do not lay on us (a burden for ) which we do not have the strength to bear, and pardon us, and protectively forgive us, and have mercy on us, You are our Guardian so help us against the people who are infidels
Alif Laam Miim
Allah, there is no god except Him, the Living, the Eternally Existing
He has sent down on you the book containing the truth, confirming that which was before it. And He had sent down the Torah and the Injeel
before, for the guidance of human beings. And He has sent down the distinction (between right and wrong, the Quran). Those who do not believe in the signs of Allah, for them there is certainly a severe punishment, and Allah is Mighty, the Inflictor of retribution
Certainly, nothing is hidden from Allah in the earth or in the sky
He it is Who gives you form in the wombs, as He wills, there is no god except Him, the Mighty, the Wise
He it is Who has sent down the book to you, in it are statements which are decisive, they are the basis of the book and others are allegorical. So those in whose hearts is (a desire for) deviation from the right, they follow that which is allegorical in it, seeking to mislead and seeking to interpret it, and no one knows its interpretation except Allah; and those sound in knowledge say, “We believe in it, all is from our Fosterer, and no one minds except those who have understanding
Our Fosterer ! do not let our hearts deviate from the right after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You, You are the One Who grants
Our Fosterer ! one day You will gather (all) human beings, there is no doubt in it, Allah certainly does not go against (His) promise.”
Those who do not believe, their wealth and their children will certainly not keep them safe from Allah in anything; and they are the persons who will be the fuel of the fire
like the people of Firawn and those before them, they denied Our signs, so Allah caught them for their sins and Allah is severe in requiting
Say to those who do not believe, "You will be overcome and gathered towards hell, and it is an evil place of habitation
Indeed there was a sign for you in the meeting of the two groups (at the battle of Badr) , one party fighting in the way of Allah and the others were infidels. They saw twice their numbers (with) the sight of the eye (that is, it was not imagination) and Allah strengthens with His help whom He wills. In this there is certainly a lesson for those who have insight
Beautified for mankind is the love of lusty feelings (that arise) due to women, and sons and treasures hoarded with gold and silver and horses of mark (means of conveyance) and cattle and tilth, that is the provision of the life of this world, while the best home is with Allah
Say, "Shall I inform you of something better than that? For those who guard (against evil), there are gardens with their Fosterer for staying in them, beneath which rivers flow, and pure mates and pleasure from Allah, and Allah is the Seer of His servants
who say: Our Fosterer! we certainly believe so protectively forgive us our sins and save us from the punishment of the fire
the patient and the truthful and the devoutly obedient and those who spend and those who ask for protective forgiveness in the early hours of morning
Allah bears witness that there is no god except Him and the angels and possessors of knowledge established on justice (too, that ) there is no god except Him, the Mighty the Wise
(True) religion with Allah is certainly Al-Islam *. And those who were given the book differed only after the knowledge (that) had come to them, due to mutual envy. And whoever does not believe in the signs of Allah, then Allah is certainly Quick at (settling) the account. * Submission to the Will of Allah in accordance with the instructions of prophet Muhammed
So if they dispute with you then say, "I have submitted myself (totally) to Allah and (so have) those who follow me," and say to those who were given the book and those who are not learned, "Do you submit?" So if they submit, then indeed they are rightly guided, but if they turn away then (the responsibility) upon you is only conveyance of the message and Allah is the Seer of His servants
Convey the news of a painful punishment to those who do not believe in the signs of Allah and slay the prophets without having the right to do so and slay those who enjoin justice from among human beings
Those are the persons whose deeds have become fruitless in the world and the hereafter, and they have no helpers
Did you not consider those who were given a part of the book? (When) they are called towards the book of Allah that it may decide between them, then a sect of them turn back and they keep away
That is because they say, "The fire shall not touch us except for a certain number of days." And that which they have forged deceives them in their religion
So how will it be when We will gather them on a day, about which there is no doubt, and every soul will be paid in full for that which it earned and injustice will not be done to them
Say,"O Allah! owner of authority, You give authority to whom You will, and You take away authority from whom You will, and You give the might to whom You will and You disgrace whom You will, in Your hand is good, You certainly have power over everything
You make the night to enter into the day and You make the day to enter into the night and You bring out the living from the dead and You bring out the dead from the living and You provide without measure to whom You will
Do not let the believers take infidels as friends besides believers, and whoever does that then there is nothing (for him) from Allah in anything, except that you guard yourselves against them guarding carefully, and Allah makes you cautious of Himself and towards Allah is the destination
Say, "Whether you hide that which is in your bosoms or manifest it, Allah knows it, and He knows whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth and Allah has power over everything
The day every soul will find that which it did of good present (before it) along with that which it did of evil, it shall wish that between it (soul) and the (evil) there were a long distance. And Allah makes you cautious of Himself and Allah is full of pity for (His) servants
Say, "If you love Allah then follow me, Allah will love you and protectively forgive you your sins and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Say, "Obey Allah and the messenger." But if they turn away, then Allah certainly does not like the infidels
Allah certainly selected Adam and Nuh and the family of Ibrahim and the family of Imran above the worlds
Some of them were offspring of the others, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing
When the wife of Imran said, "My Fosterer ! I vow to you that which is in my womb to be set free (for your service), so accept (it) from me. You are certainly Hearing, Knowing
Then when she delivered it, she said, "My Fosterer! I have delivered it a female." And Allah knew best what she had delivered, and the male is not like the female. "And I have named her Maryam and I seek Your protection for her and her offspring, from the devil, the outcast
So her Fosterer accepted her with a good acceptance and made her (Maryam) grow into a good growth and gave her into the guardianship of Zakariyya. Whenever Zakariyya entered the sanctuary to (see) her, he found provision (food) with her, he said, "O Maryam! from where (does) this (provision) come to you?" She said, "It is from (that which is ) with Allah." Allah certainly provides without measure to whom He wills
There did Zakariyya pray to his Fosterer saying, "O my Fosterer! grant me from Yourself good offspring, You are certainly the Hearer of prayer
So when he stood worshipping in the sanctuary, the angels announced to him that, "Allah conveys to you the good news of Yahya, confirmer of the word from Allah and a chief, and chaste and a prophet from among the righteous
He said, "My Fosterer! how can I have a son when I have reached old age and my wife is barren?" He (Allah) said, "Like that, Allah does what He wills
He said, "My Fosterer! appoint a sign for me, "He said", "The sign for you is that you will not speak to human beings for three days except by gesture, and remember your Fosterer much and glorify (Him) in the evening and the morning
And when the angels said, "O Maryam ! Allah has certainly chosen you and cleaned you and chosen you above the women of the worlds
O Maryam! be devoutly obedient to your Fosterer and prostrate and bow down with those who bow down
That is from the news of the unseen (which) We communicate to you, and you were not with them when they cast their pens* (to know) which of them should be the guardian of Maryam nor were you with them when they disputed (about this issue). * Lots
When the angels said, "O Maryam! certainly, Allah conveys to you the good news of a word from Him, his name is the Messiah, Isa, the son of Maryam, worthy of regard in the world and the hereafter, and from among those who are near (to Allah)
And he will talk to human beings (while) in the cradle and (in) old age, and (he will be) from among the righteous
(She) said, "O My Fosterer ! how can I have a son when man has not touched me?" He said, "Like that, Allah creates what He wills, when He decrees an affair then, He says to only, "Be," so it is. it is
And He will teach him the book and wisdom and the Torah and the Injeel
and (he will be) a messenger sent to the children of Israel, (saying) that: I have come to you with a sign from your Fosterer, that I make for you from clay, a figure like that of a bird, then I blow into it, so it becomes a bird by the permission of Allah; and I heal the blind by birth and the leper and I bring to life the dead by Allah's permission and I inform you of that which you eat and that which you store in your houses; in that there is certainly a sign for you if you are believers
And I am a testifier for that which is before me of the Torah, and (I have come) to make lawful for you something of that which was forbidden to you and I have come to you with a sign from your Fosterer so fear Allah and obey me
Allah is certainly my Fosterer and your Fosterer, so serve Him, this is the straight path
So when Isa perceived infidelity from them, (he) said, "Who will be my helpers for (the sake of) Allah." The disciples said, "We are Allah's helpers, we believe in Allah and you bear witness that we have submitted (as Muslims)
Our Fosterer ! we believe in that which you have sent down and we follow the messenger, so record us with those who bear witness
So they planned and Allah planned (too) and Allah is the Best of planners
When Allah said, "O Isa ! I will take you back and raise you towards Myself and clean you from those who do not believe; and towards the day of resurrection, I will make those who follow you, above those who do not believe, then towards Me you will all return then I will judge between you in (matters) in which you disagreed
Then as for those who do not believe, I will punish them with a severe punishment in the world and the hereafter and for them there will be no helpers." and the hereafter and for them there will be no helpers
And as for those who believe and do righteous works, He will give them their rewards in full, and Allah does not like those who are unjust
This (is what) We read to you, from the signs and a wise reminder
The likeness of Isa, with Allah is certainly as the likeness of Adam. (He) proportioned him from the soil, then said to him, "Be," so he was (created)
(This is) the truth from your Fosterer, so do not be of those who doubt
Therefore, if anyone disputes with you in this (affair) after the knowledge which has come to you, then say, "Come! let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves, then we will pray humbly and invoke the curse of Allah on the deniers (of truth)
This is certainly the true narrative and there is no one (as) god except Allah and Allah is certainly the Mighty, the Wise
So if they turn back, then Allah is certainly the Knower of those who are corrupt
Say, "O owners of the book! come to an equitable word between us and you, that we will not serve (worship) anyone except Allah and we will not associate any partner with Him and some of us will not take others as fosterers, besides Allah." But if they turn away, then say, "Bear witness that we are those who have submitted (as Muslims)
O owners of the book ! why do you dispute about Ibrahim, when Torah and the Injeel were sent down only after him. What ! then have you no sense
Yes, you are those who disputed about that of which you had knowledge but why do you dispute about that of which you have no knowledge? And Allah knows and you do not know. dispute about that of which you have no knowledge? And Allah knows and you do not know
Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian but he was upright, one who submitted (as a Muslim), and he was not of the polytheists
The nearest among mankind to Ibrahim are certainly those who followed him and this prophet and those who believe, and Allah is the Guardian of the believers
A party of the owners of the book like to mislead you, and they do not mislead (anyone) except themselves but they do not perceive
O owners of the book! why do you not believe in the signs of Allah when you are witnesses
O owners of the book ! why do you cover the truth with falsehood and hide the truth when you know
And a party of the owners of the book say, "Believe in (the Quran), which has been sent down on those who believe, at the beginning of the day and reject it at the end of it, so that they may return (to infidelity)
and believe only in him who follows your religion." Say, "Guidance of Allah is certainly the guidance, (and any) one can be given the like of what you were given (as guidance)." Otherwise they will dispute with you before your Fosterer. Say, "Grace is certainly in the hand of Allah, He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing
He selects for His mercy whom He wills and Allah is the Possessor of great grace
And from among the owners of the book, there is he who, if you entrust him with a heap of wealth, he will pay it back to you, and from among them there is he who, if you entrust him with a dinar (even a small account), he will not pay it back to you unless you stand over him (demanding it). That is because they say, "There is no way (responsibility) upon us in (connection with) the unlearned people (Arabs)," and they speak a lie against Allah while they know. it). That is because they say, "There is no way (responsibility) upon us in (connection with) the unlearned people (Arabs)," and they speak a lie against Allah while they know
Why not ! whoever fulfils his agreement and guards (against evil), then Allah certainly likes those who guard (against evil)
Those who sell Allah's agreement and their oaths for a small price, those are certainly the persons for whom there is no portion in the hereafter and Allah will not speak to them and He will not (even) look towards them on the day of resurrection and He will not purify them and for them there will be a painful punishment
And from among them there is a party who twist their tongues (in such a manner while reading) the book that you certainly consider it (to be) from the book, although it is not from the book, and they say it is from Allah though it is not from Allah and they speak a lie against Allah while they know
It is not (possible) for a man that Allah should give him the book and wisdom and prophet hood, then he should say to people, "Be my servants (worshippers) besides Allah," but (he would say), "You be servants of the Fosterer because you teach the book and because you study (it)
And neither would he command you that you should take the angels and prophets as fosterers. What ! would he command you to be infidels after you have submitted (as Muslims)
And when Allah took a pledge from the prophets, "Behold ! that which I give you of the book and wisdom, then (when) there comes to you a messenger confirming that which is with you, you must definitely believe in him and you must definitely help him (probably by propagating the news of the coming of prophet Muhammed, among their respective followers)." He asked, "Do you agree and do you accept My burden (responsibility) concerning this (matter)?" They replied, "We agree." He said, "Then bear witness and I am (also) with you from among those who bear witness
So whoever turns back after this, then those only are the transgressors
What ! do they seek a religion other than the religion of Allah, when to Him submits whoever (and whatever) is in the skies and the earth willingly and unwillingly and towards Him they will be returned
Say, "We believe in Allah and that which has been sent down on us and that which had been sent down on Ibrahim and Ismael and Ishaq and Yaqub and the tribes and that which had been given to Musa and Isa and the prophets, from their Fosterer, we make no distinction between any of them and we submit to Him (as Muslims)
And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, then it will not be accepted from him and in the hereafter he will be among those who are the losers
How would Allah guide a people who became infidels after their belief, although they had borne witness that the messenger is true and there had come to them clear proofs? And Allah does not guide the unjust people
The reward of such persons is that, upon them is the curse of Allah and the angels and mankind, all together
They will remain in it, the punishment will not be lightened on them nor will they be given time
except those who repent after that and act aright, for Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Those who became infidels after their belief then increased in infidelity, their repentance will certainly not be accepted, and those are the persons who are astray
Those who became infidels and died while they were infidels, (even) the earth full of gold will not be accepted from anyone of them if he (offers it to) ransom (himself) with it, those are certainly the persons for whom there is a painful punishment and for them there will be no helpers
You will never attain righteousness unless you spend from that which you love, and whatever you spend of anything, then Allah certainly has knowledge of it
All food was lawful to the children of Israel except that which Israel (Yaqub) had made unlawful for himself before the Torah was sent down. Say, "Bring the Torah and read it, if you are truthful
So whoever fabricates a lie against Allah after that, then those are the persons who are unjust
Say, "Allah has spoken the truth, then follow the religion (dictated by) Ibrahim the upright and he was not of the polytheists
The first house layed down for mankind is certainly the one at Becca (Kaaba at Mecca), one (which is) blessed and a guidance for the worlds
In it are clear signs, the place where Ibrahim stood, and whoever enters it, he is in security. And the pilgrimage to the house (Kaaba, is a duty incumbent) on human beings, for (the sake of ) Allah, on him who is able to find a way to it (one who has the capacity and can afford the journey), but he who rejects, then Allah is Independent of the worlds
Say, "O owners of the book ! why do you reject the signs of Allah when Allah is a Witness over what you do
Say, "O owners of the book ! why do you stop from the path of Allah, one who believes, seeking crookedness in it while you (yourselves) are witnesses? And Allah is not unaware of what you do
O you who believe ! if you obey a party of those who were given the book, they will turn you back as infidels after your belief
And how would you reject, when you are those to whom the statements of Allah are read and His messenger (too) is among you? And whoever holds firmly to Allah, he indeed is guided to the straight path
O you who believe ! fear Allah as He ought to be feared and do not die unless you are Muslims
And hold together (and be united) through the rope of Allah and do not be divided. And remember the favour of Allah on you, when you were enemies then He united your hearts, so by His favour you became brothers, and you were on the edge of a pit of fire then He saved you from it, thus does Allah make clear to you His signs that you may receive guidance
And there should be a leading group among you who should invite (people) towards good and enjoin that which is recognised (as good) and forbid that which is not recognised (as good), and those are the persons who are successful
And do not be like those who were divided (among themselves) and disagreed after the clear proofs had come to them, and those are the persons for whom there is a great punishment
On the day when (some) faces will be white while (other) faces will be black, then as for those whose faces will be black, (it will be said), "Did you become infidels after your belief ? Then taste the punishment because you did not believe
And as for those whose faces will be white, then they will be the persons who will stay in the mercy of Allah
Those are the statements of Allah which we read to you correctly, and Allah does not intend injustice to the worlds
And whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is Allah's, and (all) the affairs are returned to Allah
You are the best community raised for humanity. You enjoin that which is recognised (as good) and forbid that which is not recognised (as good) and you believe in Allah; and had the owners of the book (too) believed, it would have been better for them, among them there are believers, but most of them are transgressors
They will not harm you except annoying (you), and if they fight with you, they will turn their backs to you, then they will not be helped
Disgrace was made to strike them wherever they were found, except (when they sought) means of Allah and means of human beings, and they became deserving of the anger of Allah, and wretchedness was made to strike them. That was because they used to reject the signs of Allah and kill the prophets without having the right to do so. That was because they disobeyed and they were the persons who exceeded the limits
They (all) are not the same. From among the owners of the book, (there is) an upright community, they read the statements of Allah during the hours of the night and they prostrate
They believe in Allah and the period hereafter and enjoin that which is recognised (as good) and forbid that which is not recognised (as good) and hasten in doing good works, and they are of the righteous
And whatever good they do, they will not be refused (the reward of) it, and Allah is the Knower of those who guard (against evil)
Those who do not believe, their wealth and their children will certainly not keep them safe from Allah in anything, and those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay therein
The likeness of that which they spend in the life of this world is as the likeness of wind in which is intense cold which strikes the harvest of a people who do injustice to themselves and thus destroys it. And Allah is not unjust to them but they are unjust to themselves
O you who believe ! do not take into intimacy people other than your own, they will not spare anything to inflict loss on you, they love that which distresses you, hatred has (already) appeared through their mouths and that which they hide in their bosoms is greater. We have made clear to you the signs if you are those who understand
Ah ! you are those who love them but they do not love you, and you are those who believe in the whole of the book *. And when they meet you, they say, "We believe," but when they are alone, they bite their finger tips because of (their) anger on you. Say, "Die in your anger." Allah is certainly the Knower of that which is in the bosoms ( hearts). * All Divine Books
If good (even) touches you they feel bad and if evil befalls you they are happy about it, but if you are patient and guard yourselves, their plot will not harm you in anything. Allah is certainly the Encompassor of that which they do
And (remember) when you went out in the morning from your family, to assign to the believers their positions for the battle (of Uhad) , and Allah was Hearing, Knowing
when two parties from among you were on the point of showing cowardice though Allah was their Guardian. And on Allah then, let the believers (put their) trust
And Allah had helped you at Badr when you were weak, therefore fear Allah so as to be grateful (to Him)
When you said to the believers, "Is it not enough for you that your Fosterer should support you with three thousand of the angels, sent down
Why not? If you are patient and on your guard and these (your enemies) come on you suddenly, your Fosterer will support you with five thousand of the angels, marked. will support you with five thousand of the angels, marked
And Allah did not give this (assurance) except as a good news for you, so that your hearts should be at peace thereby, and there is no (other) help except that from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise
that He may cut off a portion from among those who did not believe or disgrace them so that they should go back (as) failures
There is nothing for you in this affair whether He turns to them (mercifully) or punishes them because they are unjust
And whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is Allah's. He protectively forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills, and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
O you who believe ! do not swallow usury, multiplied many times and fear Allah that you may be successful
And guard (yourselves) against the fire which is prepared for the infidels
And obey Allah and the messenger, that you may be shown mercy
And hasten towards protective forgiveness of your Fosterer and the garden, the extensiveness of which is the skies and the earth, prepared for those who guard (against evil)
(Those are the persons) who spend in prosperity and in adversity, and they are the restrainers of anger and the pardoners of (mistakes of) mankind, and Allah loves the doers of good
and those who, when they commit an indecency or do injustice to themselves, remember Allah and seek (His) protective forgiveness for their sins. And who protectively forgives the sins except Allah? And knowingly they do not persist in (doing) that which they did (sin). y forgives the sins except Allah? And knowingly they do not persist in (doing) that which they did (sin)
The reward of such persons is protective forgiveness from their Fosterer and gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will stay, and excellent is the reward for those who work
Many ways of life have passed before you, so travel in the earth and see how the end of those who denied (the truth) was (brought about)
This is a clear statement for mankind and a guidance and an admonition for those who guard (against evil)
And do not be weak nor grieve, for you will dominate if you are believers
If a wound has afflicted you, then a similar wound has afflicted the (other) people. And these days (ups and downs) We keep on changing among human beings by turn, so that Allah may know (mark out) those who believe and take witnesses from you, and Allah does not love the unjust
and that Allah may purify (pick out) those who believe and wipe off the infidels
Do you think that you will enter the garden (paradise) while Allah has not yet known (marked out) those who strive (in His way) from among you and known (marked out) those who are patient
And you had desired death before you met it, so you have seen it while you were looking
And Muhammed is no more than a messenger, messengers have passed before him, then if he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? And whoever turns back on his heels, he will not harm Allah in the least and Allah will reward those who are grateful
And a soul (living being) cannot die except by the order of Allah, the term (of life is) fixed (by His order). And whoever intends (to receive) the reward (in) the world, We will grant it (to him) therein, and whoever intends (to receive) the reward (in) the hereafter, We will grant it (to him) therein, and We will reward those who are grateful
And how many of the prophets fought (in the way of Allah) with whom there were many devoted men, so they did not become weak (hearted) because of what befell them in the way of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor were they humbled and Allah loves those who are patient
And their saying was nothing except that they said, "Our Fosterer ! protectively forgive us our sins and our excesses in our affair and make our feet firm and help us against the people who are infidels
So Allah gave them the reward (in) the world an (also) and excellent reward of the hereafter, and Allah loves the doers of good
O you who believe ! if you obey those who do not believe, they will turn you back on your heels, then you will turn back as loser
No, Allah is your Guardian and He is the Best of helpers
We will cast terror into the hearts of those who do not believe because they associate partners with Allah for which He has not sent down any authority, and their settling place will be the fire and evil will be the home of those who are unjust
And Allah fulfilled His promise to you when you destroyed them with His permission, until when you became weak hearted and disputed about the affair and disobeyed after He had shown you that which you loved (booty at battle of Uhad). Among you is one who intends (to receive the benefit in) the world and among you is one who intends (to receive the benefit in) the hereafter. Then He turned you away from them that He might test you and He has pardoned you and Allah is Gracious to the believers
(Remember) when you were climbing up (the hill) and were paying no heed to anyone, and the messenger was calling you from behind you, then (at that time, it was Allah Who) rewarded you with distress upon distress. (This information is being given so) that you might not grieve at what you missed nor at what befell you, and (know, that) Allah is informed of (all) that you do
Then after the distress, He sent down on you peaceful slumber (which) covered a party of you, and (another) party, they were anxious themselves, guessing about Allah (something) other than what was true, a guess of ignorance, saying, "Is there anything for us in the affair?" Say, "The affair, total of it, is certainly Allah's." They were hiding within themselves that which they would not manifest to you, saying, "Had we any power in the affair, we would not have been slain here." Say, "Even if you had been in your houses, those, for whom slaughter was written, would have certainly gone forth to the places of their death; but (all this happened) because Allah wanted to test that which was in your bosoms so that He might purify that which was in your hearts. And Allah is the Knower of that which is in the bosoms
Those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met, it was certainly the devil alone who caused them to slip because of (the evil of) some (deeds) they had earned, but Allah has pardoned them, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Clement (Kind)
O you who believe ! do not be like those who do not believe and say of their brothers when they travel in the earth or are engaged in fighting, "Had they been with us they would not have died or been killed, "that Allah may make that a regret in their hearts, and Allah gives life and causes death and Allah is the Seer of what you do
And whether you are slain in the way of Allah or you die, protective forgiveness from Allah and (His) mercy are better than that which they amass
And whether you die or you are slain, (in any case) you will be gathered towards Allah
So it is due to the mercy of Allah that you are soft (hearted) with them and had you been stern, hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you, so pardon them and ask for protective forgiveness for them and consult them in the affair, but when you are determined then put your trust in Allah, Allah certainly loves those who put their trust (in Him)
If Allah helps you, no one can overcome you. And if He forsakes you, then who is there after Him who can help you? Therefore, let the believers put their trust in Allah
And it is not (in the nature) of any prophet to cheat, and he who cheats, will (have to) bring on the day of resurrection that which he cheated, then everyone will be repaid fully for that which he earned and injustice will not be done to them
Then, is he, who follows Allah's pleasure, like him who deserves displeasure of Allah and his settling place is hell? And it is an evil destination
There are grades for them with Allah and Allah is the Seer of that which they do
Allah did bestow a favour on the believers when He raised a messenger among them from among themselves, reading to them His statements (Quran) and purifying them and teaching them the book (laws) and the wisdom (their interpretation), and although before that they were in clear error
What ! when a disaster befell you, although you had afflicted (the infidels with a disaster) twice (of that which befell you), you say, "Wherefrom is this?" Say, "It is from yourselves." Allah certainly has power over everything
And what befell you on the day the two armies met, was with Allah's permission, that He might know (mark out) the believers
and that He might know (mark out) the hypocrites. And (when) it was said to them, "Come fight in the way of Allah or drive out (the enemy)." They said, "Had we known fighting we would have followed you." On that day they were nearer to infidelity than to belief, saying with their mouths that which was not in their hearts, and Allah knows best that which they hide. mouths that which was not in their hearts, and Allah knows best that which they hide
Those who said about their brothers (who were slain in the cause of Allah), while they themselves sat at home, "Had they obeyed us they would not have been killed." Say (to them), "Then avert death from yourselves, if what you say is true
And do not consider, those who are slain in the way of Allah, (as) dead. No, they are alive, with their Fosterer, being provided (with sustenance)
they are rejoicing in that which Allah has given them out of His grace and are glad regarding those who have not yet joined them from among those (believers) left behind (in the world), that there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve
They are glad because of the favour of Allah with (His) grace and that Allah does not waste the reward of the believers
Those who responded to (the call of) Allah and the messenger, even after being wounded, for those who did good from among them and guarded (against evil) there is a great reward
Those to whom, (when) the people said, "Men have gathered against you, therefore fear them," but (this threat) certainly increased their belief and they said, "Allah is sufficient for us and (He is) the Most Excellent Trustee
So they returned with favour from Allah and (His) grace, no evil touched them and they followed the pleasure of Allah and Allah is the Possessor of great grace
It is only the devil who makes you afraid of his friends, so do not fear them but fear Me if you are believers
And do not let those grieve you, who hastily fall into infidelity, they can never harm Allah in the least. Allah does not intend to give them any portion in the hereafter and for them there is a great punishment. great punishment
Those who purchase infidelity at the cost of belief, can never harm Allah in the least, and for them there is a painful punishment
And do not let those who do not believe, think that Our granting them time is good for them, We grant them time with the sole purpose that they should increase in sin and for them there is a disgraceful punishment
Allah will not leave the believers in the condition in which you are, (this is only) till He separates the evil from the good, and Allah will not disclose to you the unseen but Allah chooses from among His messengers whom He wills; so believe in Allah and His messengers and if you believe and guard (against evil), then for you there is a great reward
And do not let those who hoard up (miserly) that which Allah has given them of His grace think that it is better for them. No, it is bad for them. That which they hoard (miserly) will be their collar on the day of resurrection, and Allah's is the heritage of the skies and the earth and Allah is informed of what you do
Allah has heard the saying of those who said, "Allah is poor and we are rich." We will record what they said, and their killing the prophets without having the right to do so, and We will say, "Taste the punishment of burning
That is because of what your hands have sent before, and because Allah is not unjust to His servants
(To) those who said, "Allah has made An agreement with us that we should certainly not believe in any messenger until he brings to us an offering which is consumed by the fire," say, "Messengers had come to you before me with clear proofs and with that which you ask for, then why did you kill them, if you were truthful
So if they deny you, thus messengers before you were (also) denied, (though) they had come with clear proofs and the scriptures (Zuboor) and the book giving light
Every soul tastes death, and you will be paid back in full, your reward, only on the day of resurrection. So whoever is removed far away from the fire and is made to enter the garden, then he has achieved (the object), and the life of the world is nothing but a deceptive provision
You will definitely be tested through your wealth and yourselves (personal efforts) and you will definitely hear much harmful (talk) from those who were given the book before you and from those who associate partners (with Allah), but if you are patient and guard (against evil) then that will certainly be a determining factor of affairs
And when Allah took a pledge from those who were given the book, "You shall make the (book) clear to mankind and you shall not hide it," they threw it behind their backs and purchased a small gain through it, so evil is that which they purchased
Do not think that those who are happy for that which they have done and love to be praised for what they did not do, so do not think that they are in safety from the punishment when there is a painful punishment (waiting) for them
And the kingdom of the skies and the earth is Allah's and Allah has power over everything
In the creation of the skies (heavenly bodies) and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day, certainly there are signs for men of understanding
who remember Allah, standing and sitting and lying on their sides and reflect on the creation of the skies and the earth, " O our Fosterer ! You have not created this in vain. You are Glorified ( above all ) so save us from the punishment of the fire
Our Fosterer ! whomever You make to enter the fire, You have certainly disgraced him, and for those who are unjust there will be no helpers
Our Fosterer ! we heard the call of one calling to belief, saying: Believe in your Fosterer, so we believed. Our Fosterer ! so protectively forgive us our sins and remove from us (the effect of) our evil deeds and pay us back in full (or make us die) along with the righteous
Our Fosterer ! and grant us that which You promised us through Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the day of resurrection, You certainly do not go against Your promise
So their Fosterer responded to them, "I do not waste the work of a (single) worker among you, whether male or female, some of you are from others. So those who migrated and were driven out from their houses and were harmed in My way and who fought and were slain, I will definitely remove from them (the effect of) their evil deeds and I will definitely make them enter the gardens beneath which rivers flow," a reward from that which is with Allah, and the best reward is with Allah
Do not let the movement in the cities, of those who do not believe, deceive you
A brief enjoyment, then their home is hell and it is an evil place of habitation
But those who fear their Fosterer, for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein, a gift from that which is with Allah, and that which is with Allah is the best for the righteous
And among the owners of the book there are those who certainly believe in Allah and that which is sent down to you and that which was sent down to them, humbling themselves before Allah, they do not purchase through the signs of Allah, a small price. Those are the persons for whom there is their reward with their Fosterer, Allah is certainly Quick in (settling) the account
O you who believe ! be patient and exhibit patience and strength (by being tied to each other) and fear Allah that you may be successful
O mankind ! fear your Fosterer Who created you from a single soul and created from it, its mate, and spread from these two, many men and women. And fear Allah due to Whom you (are in a position to) ask one another (regarding your necessities) and (be careful of) the ties of relationship, Allah is certainly Vigilant over you
And give to the orphans their wealth and do not exchange bad (things) for good ones and do not absorb their wealth into your wealth, this is certainly a great sin.
And if you fear that you cannot do justice to orphans, then marry from among the women who seem good to you, two and three and four, but if you fear that you cannot show equality (between them) then (marry) only one or (a slave girl) whom your right hands possess. Thus it is more likely that you may not do injustice
And give their dowries to the women as a free gift, but if they of themselves (voluntarily) give up anything from it to you, then absorb it (in your wealth) enjoying the result (of this increase)
And do not give your wealth, which Allah has made a means of support for you, to the insane, but give them provisions (of life) from it and clothe them and speak to them in words recognised (as good)
And test the orphans till the time they reach the age of marriage, then if you find in them, the capacity for correct judgment, then hand over their wealth to them, and do not consume it extravagantly and hastily (fearing) that they will grow up (and then claim their wealth), and if the (guardian) is rich then let him abstain (from using the wealth of the orphans) and if the (guardian) is poor, then let him consume in a recognised (good manner). And when you hand over to the (orphans) their wealth, have witnesses on them though Allah is sufficient as One Who takes account. in (from using the wealth of the orphans) and if the (guardian) is poor, then let him consume in a recognised (good manner). And when you hand over to the (orphans) their wealth, have witnesses on them though Allah is sufficient as One Who takes account
For men is a share from that which the parents and near relatives leave behind and for women is a share from that which the parents and near relatives leave behind, whether there is little or much of the (wealth left behind), an allotted share
And when at the time of division, people having relationship and the orphans and the poor are present, then provide them from the (wealth left behind) and speak to them in words recognised (as good)
And let those be afraid (of being unjust to orphans) who, if they (had themselves) left behind them weak offspring, would be afraid (of injustice) to their (own offspring), so let them fear Allah and speak to them the right (consoling) words
Those who swallow the wealth of orphans unjustly, they certainly swallow only fire into their stomachs and they will enter the blazing fire
Allah directs you concerning your children: For the male a portion equivalent of two females. And if there are more than two females then theirs is two thirds of what is left (to be inherited) and if there is only one, then for her half. And for his parents, for each of them the sixth of what is left behind if he has a child but if he does not have a child and (only) his parents inherit him, then for the mother a third, but if he has brothers then to his mother one sixth after fulfilling the directions of the deceased with which he had directed or (payment of) loan (which he left unpaid); (between) your parents and your children, you do not know which of them is nearer to you in usefulness, (this is an) ordinance from Allah and Allah is certainly Knowing, Wise

And if a man or a woman whose (property) is to be inherited, has neither ascendants nor descendants and he/she has a brother or sister then to each one of the two one sixth, but if there are more than that then they are sharers in one third after fulfilling the directions of the deceased with which he had directed or (payment of) loan (which he/she left unpaid) without harming; (this is a ) direction from Allah and Allah is Knowing, Clement (Kind)
Those are the limits of Allah so whoever obeys Allah and His messenger, He will make him to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, for staying therein and that is a great achievement
And whoever disobeys Allah and His messenger and exceeds His limits, He will make him to enter the fire to stay therein, and for him is a disgraceful punishment
And as for those of your women who are guilty of indecency, produce four witnesses against them from among you, then if they bear witness (by testifying the truth of the allegation) then withhold them inside the houses until death takes them away or Allah opens out for them (some) way
And as for the two men who are guilty of the (indecency) from among you, punish them both, but if they repent and amend then turn away from them, Allah is certainly the Accepter of repentance, Merciful
Acceptance of repentance by Allah, is only for those who do evil in ignorance then repent soon, so those are the persons from whom Allah accepts repentance and Allah is Knowing, Wise
And acceptance of repentance is not for those who are involved in evil deeds until when death comes to one of them (and then) he says, "Now I repent," nor for those who die while they are infidels, those are the persons for whom We have prepared a painful punishment
O you who believe ! it is not lawful for you to inherit women forcibly; and do not withhold them (unjustly) that you may take away part of that which you have given them unless they are guilty of manifest indecency, but live with them in a recognised (good manner), and if you dislike them, it may be that you dislike a thing while Allah has placed plenty of good in it
And if you intend to exchange one wife in the place of another and if you have given one of them (even) a treasure, then do not take (back) anything from it. Would you take it (back) by slander * and manifest sin? * A false report to injure someone’s reputation
And how can you take it (back) when one of you has gone into the other and they have taken from you a strong pledge
And do not marry those women whom your fathers had married, (there is an) exception to what has already happened in the past, it was certainly indecent and hateful and an evil way

And when the (maids) are taken in wedlock and (then) if they commit an indecency, then on them is half of the punishment of that on free women.

If you keep away from great (sins) which you are forbidden, We will remove (the effect of ) your evil deeds from you and We will make you to enter an honoured entry
And do not long for those (articles) in which Allah has been more gracious to some compared to others, for the men is a share of that which they have earned and for the women is a share of that which they have earned, and ask Allah for His grace, Allah is certainly the Knower of everything. everything
And for everyone We have appointed heirs for that which parents and near relatives leave (behind for inheritance) and to those with whom your right hands are tied, (with whom you have made an agreement), give them their share, Allah is certainly a Witness over everything
Men are established over women because of that in which Allah has been (more) gracious to some (men), compared to others (women), and because of that which the (men) spend from their wealth; therefore the righteous women are obedient, guardians of the unseen (their chastity in all respects), which Allah (orders that it should be) guarded. And as for those (women) from whom you fear confrontation, admonish them and leave them alone in their sleeping places and strike them (by word or action) then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them, Allah is certainly High, Great
And if you are afraid of a split between the (husband and wife) then appoint a judge from his people and a judge from her people, if they intend reconciliation, Allah will effect reconciliation between them, Allah is certainly Knowing, Informed
And serve Allah and do not associate anything with Him as a partner, and be good to parents and to the relatives and the orphans and the needy and the neighbor who is related and the neighbor who is strange (not related) and the companion by your side and the wayfarer and (slaves) whom your right hands possess; Allah certainly does not like him who is proud, boastful
those who hoard (their wealth being miserly) and enjoin (other) people (also) to hoard, and hide that which Allah has given them of His grace, and We have prepared a disgraceful punishment for the infidels
and those who spend their wealth for showing (their generosity) to people and do not believe in Allah and in the period hereafter. And one for whom the devil becomes a comrade, then (he has) an evil comrade
And what (loss would have been there) on them had they believed in Allah and the period hereafter and spent from that which Allah had provided for them, when Allah is knowing about them
Allah certainly does not do injustice (amounting even) to the weight of a particle, and if there is a good (deed) He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward
Then how will it be when We will bring from every community a witness and We will bring you as a witness over these
On that day, those who had not believed and disobeyed the messenger would like that the earth were leveled with them, and they will not be able to hide from Allah (any) happening (event)
O you who believe ! do not go near worship (salat) when you are intoxicated (not conscious) until you know what you say, nor when you have not taken a bath after sexual intercourse (or passing out of semen during sleep etc) until you have bathed, except when you are traveling on a road, and if you are sick or on a journey or one of you comes from the toilet or you have touched women, then (under the above circumstances if) you do not find water then take clean dust and wipe your faces and your hands, Allah is certainly Pardoning, Protectively Forgiving
Did you not consider those who were given a portion of the book? They purchase error and intend that you should go astray from the way
And Allah knows best your enemies and Allah is sufficient as a Guardian and Allah is sufficient as a Helper
Of those who are Jews, they alter the words from their places and say, "We heard and we disobey, and hear, you may not be made to hear," and "Listen to us," distorting (the word) with their tongues (when it means, he is a fool) and taunting (at) the religion (Islam), and had they said, "We hear and we obey," and "Hear and look at us." it would have been better for them and more upright, but Allah has cursed them because of their infidelity so they do not believe, except a few (of them). more upright, but Allah has cursed them because of their infidelity so they do not believe, except a few (of them)
O you who have been given the book ! believe in (the Quran), which We have sent down, confirming that which is with you (Torah, Bible etc.), before We destroy faces then turn them on their backs or curse them as We had cursed the Sabbath breakers, and Allah's command is executed
Allah certainly does not forgive associating of partners with Him (polytheism), and He protectively forgives (any sin) other than that, to whom He wills; and one who associates partners with Allah (a polytheist), he indeed fabricates a great sin
Did you not consider those who attribute purity to them selves? No, Allah purifies whom He wills and they are not dealt with unjustly even to the extend of the hair on a date stone
see how they fabricate falsehood about Allah, and that itself is sufficient as a clear sin (to prove that they are not pure)
Did you not consider those who were given a portion from the book? They believe in idols and false deities and say about those who do not believe, "These (infidels) are better guided on the (right) way than those who believe
Those are the persons whom Allah has cursed and he whom Allah curses, you will never find for him a helper
Or have they a share in the kingdom? Then in that case they would not have given (to other) people, even a speck on a date stone
Or are they jealous of the people on account of that which Allah has given them from His grace? Then We indeed gave to the family (progeny) of Ibrahim, the book and the wisdom, and We gave them a great kingdom. We gave them a great kingdom
So among them were (some) who believed in it and among them were (others) who turned away from it, and hell is sufficient for (their) burning
Those who do not believe in Our signs, We will certainly make them enter the fire, as their skins are thoroughly burned, We will change them for other (new) skins that they may taste the punishment, Allah is certainly Mighty, Wise
And those who believe and do righteous works We will make them enter the gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein for ever, for them there will be clean mates therein and We will make them enter a shady shade
Allah certainly commands you that you should return the trusts (deposited by people), to their owners, and when you judge between people then you should judge with justice. That with which Allah admonishes you is certainly excellent, Allah is certainly Hearing, Seeing
O you who believe ! obey Allah and obey the messenger and those who are in authority among you. And if you have a dispute in anything, then refer it to Allah * and the messenger # if you are believers in Allah and the period hereafter. That is the best (practice) and (the result of such practice is) the best result. * & # Consult the Quran and Hadis for taking the right decision
Did you not consider those who claim that they believe in that which is sent down to you and that which was sent down before you? They intend to call one another to the false deities $ for the judgment (of their disputes), though they were commanded to reject them, and the devil intends to mislead them far astray. $ Authorities other than Allah
And when it is said to them, "Come to what Allah has sent down and to the messenger (for judgment)," you see the hypocrites turn away from you, ignoring
Then how will it be when the disaster will befall them on account of that which their hands have sent forth, then they will come to you swearing by Allah, "We did not intend anything except good and conciliation
Those are the persons (about whom) Allah knows that which is there in their hearts, so keep away from them, but admonish them and speak to them in words (which would) reach their souls
And We did not send any messenger but to be obeyed by Allah's permission. And when they were unjust to themselves, had they come to you and asked for protective forgiveness of Allah and had the messenger (also) asked for protective forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah, Accepter of repentance, Merciful
But no, by your Fosterer ! they will not (be considered to have) believed, until they make you a judge for that which is in dispute among them, then find no objection in their souls (minds) regarding that which you have decided and accept it submissively
And had We prescribed for them that, "Kill yourselves or go out from your houses," they would not have done it except a few of them, and had they done that which they are admonished with, it would have been better for them and (it would have) established (them) more firmly
and then We would have given them from Ourselves, a great reward
and We would have guided them to the straight path
And whoever obeys Allah and the messenger, then such (people) will be with those whom Allah has favoured, from among the prophets and the truthful and the witnesses (martyrs) and the righteous and those are (members of) a beautiful company
That is the grace of Allah and Allah is sufficient as a Knower
O you who believe ! take your precautions, then go forth in detachments or go forth all together
And certainly among you is he who would definitely stay behind, and if a disaster befalls you he would say, "Allah has favoured me that I was not present with them
And if (something) graceful befalls you from Allah, he would definitely say, as if there had been no love (acquaintance) between you and him, "Oh ! I wish I had been with them, then I (too) would have achieved a great achievement
Therefore let those fight in the way of Allah who sell this world's life for the (life) of the hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of Allah, then whether he is slain or is victorious We will give him a great reward (for his effort)
And what is (the reason) you have that you do not fight in the way of Allah and (for) the weak among the men and the women and the children who say (pray), "Our Fosterer ! bring us out of this town whose people are unjust and appoint a guardian for us from Yourself and appoint a helper for us from Yourself
Those who believe, fight in the way of Allah and those who do not believe, fight in the way of false deities (evil); so fight the friends of the devil, the plot of the devil is certainly weak
Did you not consider those to whom it was said, "With hold your hands and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat)?" But when fighting was prescribed for them, a party of them feared human beings as they ought to have feared Allah or with a stronger fear, and said, "Our Fosterer ! why did you prescribe fighting on us, why did you not postpone it for us till a nearby term?" Say, "The provision of this world is little and the hereafter is better for one who guards (against evil) and you will not be dealt with unjustly even to the extent of the hair on a date stone
Wherever you be, death will catch you up, even if you are in towers raised high. And if good befalls them they say, "This is from Allah," and if evil befalls them they say, "This is from you," say, "Everything is from Allah." So what is (wrong) with these people that they do not (even) intend to understand a happening (or a statement)? say, "Everything is from Allah." So what is (wrong) with these people that they do not (even) intend to understand a happening (or a statement)
Whatever befalls you (Muhammed) of good then it is from Allah and whatever befalls you of evil, then it is from yourself. And We have sent you to mankind as a messenger and Allah is sufficient as a Witness
Whoever obeys the messenger, then he indeed obeys Allah, and (if any) one turns away, then We have not sent you as a protector over them
And they say, "Obedience." but when they go out from your presence, a party from among them spend the night in (things) other than what you ask (them to do), and Allah records that which they spend the night in, so keep away from them and trust in Allah and Allah is sufficient as a Trustee
Do they not reflect on the Quran, that had it been from someone other than Allah, they would have found many a contradiction in it
And when there comes to them any (rumour of an) affair, of peace or fear, they spread it, but had they referred it to the messenger or to those in authority among them, then those among them who could investigate it would have known it (and found out the truth of the affair); and had the grace of Allah and His mercy not been on you, you (all) would have followed the devil, except a few
So fight in the way of Allah, you are not made responsible for anyone except yourself, but rouse the believers, it may be that Allah will restrain the might of those who do not believe, and Allah is the Strongest in might and the Strongest in giving exemplary punishment
One who, while helping others in, (himself) joins a good (cause), for him is a share in it, and one who, while helping others in, (himself) joins evil, on him is the responsibility of it, and Allah is the Controller over everything
And when you are greeted with a greeting, then greet (back in a manner) better than that or return it (with equal courtesy), Allah is certainly One who takes account of everything
Allah, there is no god except Him, He will definitely gather (all of) you together on the day of resurrection, there is no doubt in it. And who is more truthful in statement than Allah
Then what is (the matter) with you that you have become two parties regarding the hypocrites when Allah has returned them (to hypocrisy) because of that which they earned? Do you intend to guide him whom Allah has left in error? And whomsoever Allah leaves in error, then for him you will never (be able to) find a way
The (hypocrites) like (that) you too should not believe as they do not believe, then you all would become equal. There fore do not take friends from among them till they migrate in the way of Allah, but if they turn back then catch them and kill them wherever you find them and do not take a friend or a helper from among them
except those, who get closely associated to people, between whom and you is a treaty or who come to you (with) their hearts stopping them from fighting you or fighting their own people. And had Allah willed He could have given them authority over you then they would have fought you. Therefore if they withdraw from you and do not fight with you and offer you peace, then Allah has not given to you a way against them (to fight)
You will find others who intend that they should be at peace with you and at peace with their own people, (but) whenever they are turned back to the temptation they fall into it, so if they do not withdraw from you and (do not) offer you peace nor hold back their hands, then catch them and kill them wherever you find them, and those are the persons against whom We have given you clear authority (for such action)
And it does not befit a believer to kill (another) believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer (even) by mistake, he should set free a believing slave and pay the blood money to the people (of the slain), except that (the people of the slain do not take the money and) leave it as charity. And if the slain was from a people who are at enemity with you but he was a believer then he (the murderer) should set free a believing slave; the slain was from a people between whom and you is a treaty, then the blood-money should be paid to his (slain's) people and (in addition, the murderer) should set free a believing slave, and one who cannot find (the means) should in that case, fast for two successive months. A penance from Allah and Allah is Knowing, Wise. people (of the slain), except that (the people of the slain do not take the money and) leave it as charity. And if the slain was from a people who are at enemity with you but he was a believer then he (the murderer) should set free a believing slave; the slain was from a people between whom and you is a treaty, then the blood-money should be paid to his (slain's) people and (in addition, the murderer) should set free a believing slave, and one who cannot find (the means) should in that case, fast for two successive months. A penance from Allah and Allah is Knowing, Wise
And whoever kills a believer intentionally, then his reward is hell, he will stay therein, and Allah is angry with him and has created him and has prepared for him a great punishment
O you who believe ! when you go striking in the way of Allah, carefully investigate and do not say to one who offers you peace, (or salutation), "You are not a believer," seeking apparent good of the life of this world (by way of taking away his belongings as booty of war), because with Allah is abundant gain (better than the booty of war). Earlier, you too were like that but Allah bestowed His favour on you, so carefully investigate. Allah is certainly informed about what you do
Those believers who sit (at home) without receiving any injury are not equal to those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth and their persons. Allah has been more gracious to those who strive with their wealth and their persons by (giving them a higher) rank over those who sit (at home), and to each Allah has promised good but Allah has been more gracious to those who strive, by giving them a greater reward compared to those who sit (at home)
ranks from Him and protective forgiveness and mercy and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Certainly, (when) the angels will cause to die those who were unjust to themselves, they will ask, "In what (state) were you?" They will reply, "We were weak in the earth." (The angels) will say, "Was not the earth of Allah spacious so that you could have migrated therein?" Then their settling place will be hell and it will be an evil destination
except the weak among the men and the women and the children who neither have (any) means in their power nor (anyone) to guide them to the way (for migration)
So those, it may be that Allah will pardon them and Allah is Pardoning, Protectively Forgiving
And whoever migrates in the way of Allah, he will find numerous places of refuge in the earth and abundance (in livelihood). And whoever goes forth from his house as a migrant to Allah and His messenger then death catches him, his reward has then become incumbent on Allah and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And when you go striking in the earth, then there is no sin on you if you shorten (something) from the worship (salat), if you fear that those who do not believe will persecute you. The infidels are certainly your n enemies
And when you are among them and establish worship (salat) for them then let (only) one party from among them stand with you (for worship) and let the (other party) take their weapons; then when they have prostrated (and finished offering worship) let the (first party) take their positions behind you, and let the other party who did not worship (in the first batch) come (and) then let them worship with you and let the (first party) take their precaution and their weapons. Those who do not believe, wish that you should be careless of your weapons and your provision, so that they (could) attack you with a single (sudden and united) attack. And there is no sin on you if you lay down your weapons when you are annoyed due to rain or if you are sick, but take your precaution. Allah has certainly prepared a disgraceful punishment for the infidels
Then when you have finished the worship (salat) remember Allah standing and sitting and (lying down) on your sides. Then when you are in safety, establish (regular) worship. Worship (salat) is certainly prescribed for the believers at fixed timings
And do not be weak hearted in the pursuit of the (enemy's) people, if you are in pain then they too are in pain as you are in pain, and you hope from Allah that which they do not hope for, and Allah is Knowing, Wise
We have sent down to you the book containing the truth so that you may judge between people through that which Allah has shown to you. And do not be a disputer for those who betray the trust (put in them)
and seek protective forgiveness from Allah, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And do not plead on behalf of those who betray their own selves, Allah certainly does not like one who betrays the trust (put in him), sinful
They hide themselves from human beings but cannot hide themselves from Allah, and He is with them when they spend the night (in discussing) in words which do not please Him, and Allah encompasses what they do
Ah ! you are the persons who plead on their behalf in the life of this world, but who will plead on their behalf before Allah, on the day of resurrection, or who will act as a trustee for them
And whoever does evil or is unjust to his own self, then seeks protective forgiveness from Allah, he will find Allah Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And whoever earns (commits) a sin, he earns it only against his own self and Allah is Knowing, Wise
And whoever earns (commits) a mistake or a sin, then throws (the blame) on one who is innocent of it, then he has burdened himself (with the fault of ascribing) a false charge and a clear sin
And had Allah's grace and mercy not been on you, a party from among them had designed to mislead you. But they do not mislead anyone except themselves and they will not harm you in the least. And Allah has sent down to you the book and the wisdom and He has taught you that which you did not know and the grace of Allah on you is great
In most of their secret talks there is no good except (in his) who enjoins charity or recognised (good) or reconciliation between people, and whoever does that seeking the pleasure of Allah, We will give him a great reward
And whoever opposes the messenger after the guidance having been made clear to him and he follows the way other than that of the believers, We will turn him to that which he (himself) has turned to, and We will make him enter hell and that is an evil destination
Allah certainly does not forgive associating of partners with Him and He protectively forgives (any sin) other than that, to whom He wills; and one who associates partners with Allah has indeed erred, going far astray
They do not pray to (anyone) besides Him except to female (names) and they do not pray to (anyone) except to the devil a rebel
whom Allah has cursed and (who had) said, "I will definitely take an appointed portion from Your servants
and I will definitely mislead them and I will definitely excite vain desires in them and I will definitely command them so they will slit the ears of cattle and I will definitely command them, so they will definitely alter Allah's creation." And whoever takes the devil as a friend besides Allah, then he indeed has incurred a loss, a manifest loss (it is)
He (the devil) promises them and excites vain desires in them, and the devil does not promise them (anything) but deception
Their settling place is hell and they will not find from it (any way of) escape
And those who believe and do righteous works, We will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, to stay therein for ever. Allah's promise is true and who is more truthful (in his) word than Allah
It will not be in accordance with your vain desires nor in accordance with the vain desires of the owners of the book, whoever does evil, he will be requited with it, and he will not find for himself anyone besides Allah, (as) a guardian or a helper
And whoever does deeds of righteousness, whether male or female and he/she is a believer, then those will enter the garden and they will not be dealt with unjustly to the extent of a speck on a date-stone
And who is better in religion than he who submits his person (attention) to Allah and he is (also) a doer of good and follows the religion (dictated by) Ibrahim, the upright? And Allah had taken Ibrahim as a friend
And whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is Allah's and Allah is the Encompasser of everything
And they ask you about the women, say: Allah instructs you about them through that which is read to you from the book concerning the orphans among the women whom you do not give that which was prescribed for them nor do you desire to marry them, and the weak among the children, and that you stand with justice for the orphans; and whatever good you do, then Allah is certainly a Knower of it
And if a wife fears confrontation or desertion from her husband, there is no sin on them both if they reconcile between themselves (with a suitable) reconciliation, and reconciliation is better. And selfishness has been made to be present in the souls, and if you do good and guard (against evil), then Allah is certainly informed of what you do
And you will never be able to deal with equality between women (your wives) even if you excessively desire it, but do not be disinclined (from anyone of them) with total disinclination so as to leave her as if suspended; and if you act righteously and guard (against evil) then Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And if they (wife and husband) separate, Allah will make each of them self-sufficient (by giving) from His Omnipresent ampleness, and Allah is Omnipresent (Ample-giving), Wise
And whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is Allah's. And We had directed those who were given the book before you and (We direct) you (too) that you should fear Allah, but if you become infidels then whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is certainly Allah's and Allah is Independent, Praised
And whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is Allah's, and Allah is sufficient as a Trustee
If He wills, He can make you pass away, O mankind ! and bring others(in your place), and Allah has power over that
Whoever intends (to receive) the reward (in) this world, then with Allah is the reward of this world and the hereafter, and Allah is Hearing, Seeing
O you who believe! be establishers of justice, bearers of witness for (the sake of) Allah even if it be against yourselves or parents or relatives, whether he be rich or poor, because Allah will turn to both of them (for taking account of their deeds). So do not follow your desire while you execute justice and if you distort or keep away (from doing justice) then Allah is certainly informed of what you do
O you who (claim to) believe ! believe in Allah and His messenger and the book which He has sent down to His messenger and the book which He had sent down earlier. And one who does not believe in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers and the period hereafter, then he has indeed erred, going far astray
Those who believe then do not believe, then believe then do not believe, then increase in infidelity, certainly Allah will neither forgive them, nor will He guide them to (the right) way
Convey the news to the hypocrites that for them there is a painful punishment
Those who take the infidels as friends besides the believers, do they seek might (power) from them? Then total might is certainly Allah's
And He has sent down (instructions) for you through the book, that when you hear the signs of Allah being rejected and mocked at, then do not sit with them till they get involved in some issue other than that, otherwise you (too) will become like them. Allah will certainly gather all the hypocrites and the infidels in hell
(There are) those who wait for you, so if you get a victory from Allah, they say, "Were we not with you?" And if the share (of victory) is for the infidels, they say (to the infidels), "Did we not have mastery over you and protect you from the believers?" So Allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection. And Allah will not give the infidels a way (of dominance) over the believers
The hypocrites certainly (presume to) deceive Allah but He deceives them. And when they stand up for worship (salat), they stand up as if loaded with a burden, (just) to show to human beings and they do not remember Allah save a little
wavering between this (belief) and that (infidelity) neither belonging to these nor to those, and whom Allah leaves to go astray, then you will not find for him a way
O you who believe ! do not take the infidels as friends besides the believers. Do you intend to give to Allah a clear authoritative (proof of disobeying Him), against yourselves
The hypocrites will certainly be in the lowest depth of fire and you will not find for them a helper
except those who repent and amend and hold fast to Allah and make their religion exclusively for Allah, then those are with the believers and Allah will give the believers a great reward
What will Allah do (gain) by punishing you if you gratefully (acknowledge Him) and believe? And Allah is One Who acknowledges, Knowing
Allah does not like manifest evil in speech, except (from) one to whom injustice was done, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing

Those who do not believe in Allah and His messengers and intend to make a distinction between Allah and His messengers and say, "We believe in some and we do not believe in others," and intend to adopt a way in between that
those are the persons who are real infidels. And We have certainly prepared a disgraceful punishment for the infidels
And those who believe in Allah and His messengers and do not make a distinction between any of them, those will be given their rewards, and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
The owners of the book demand from you that you should bring down a book on them, from the sky. They had demanded of Musa (something) greater than that, they said, "Show us Allah openly." Therefore due to their injustice, the thunder-bolt took (hold of) them. Then they took the calf ( for worship), after clear signs had come to them, but We pardoned(even) that and We gave Musa clear authority. of Musa (something) greater than that, they said, "Show us Allah openly." Therefore due to their injustice, the thunder-bolt took (hold of) them. Then they took the calf ( for worship), after clear signs had come to them, but We pardoned(even) that and We gave Musa clear authority
And We raised the Mount Toor above them for their pledge and We said to them, "Enter the gate prostrating," and We (further) said to them, "Do not exceed the limits in (the matter of) the Sabbath," and thus We took from them a firm pledge
(We punished them) due to their breaking their pledge and their not believing in the signs of Allah and their killing the prophets without having the right to do so and their saying, "Our hearts are coverings," No, Allah has set a seal upon them due to their infidelity, therefore they do not believe except a few (of them)
And (We punished them) due to their infidelity, and due to the great false charge on Maryam in their speech
and (due to) their saying, "We killed Messiah, Isa the son of Maryam, messenger of Allah." And they did not kill him nor did they crucify him, but for them, he (the one crucified) was made to resemble (Isa), and those who differ in it are certainly in a doubt about it. They do not have any knowledge of it, they follow nothing but conjecture and they certainly did not kill him
No ! Allah raised him towards Himself and Allah is Mighty, Wise
And there is not a single person from among the owners of the book but he will definitely believe in him before his death, and on the day of resurrection he will be a witness on them
Because of the injustice of the Jews, We made unlawful on them the good (things of their liking) which were lawful for them (earlier) and because of their turning away many (people) from the way of Allah
and their taking usury when they were indeed forbidden from it, and their wrongfully swallowing the wealth of people. And We have prepared for the infidels among them, a painful punishment
But those of them who are sound in knowledge and the believers believe in that which has been sent down to you and that which was sent down before you, and those who establish worship (salat) and give the charity (zakat) and the believers in Allah and the period hereafter, We will give (all of) them a great reward
We communicated to you as We communicated to Nuh and the prophets after him; and We communicated to Ibrahim, and Ismael and Ishaq and Yaqub and the tribes and Isa and Iyub and Yunus and Harun and Sulaiman and We gave Dawood a scripture (Zabur)
and messengers about whom We did mention to you earlier and messengers about whom We did not mention to you, and Allah spoke to Musa speaking (to him directly)
messengers, conveyers of good news and warners, that there should not be any plea for mankind against Allah (of not having been informed of the right path) after (receiving the message of) the messengers, and Allah is Mighty, Wise
But Allah bears witness regarding that which He sent down to you, (that) He sent it down with His knowledge and the angels (too) bear witness and Allah is sufficient as a Witness
Those who do not believe and turn away (people) from the way of Allah, have certainly erred, going far astray
Allah will certainly not forgive those who do not believe and are unjust, nor will He guide them to (any) road
except the road of hell, they will stay in it for ever and that is easy for Allah
O mankind ! the messenger has come to you with the truth from your Fosterer, therefore believe (in him, that will be) better for you, and if you do not believe then (know that) whatever is in the skies and the earth, is certainly Allah's, and Allah is Knowing, Wise
O owners of the book ! do not commit excesses in your religion, and do not say about Allah (anything) other than the truth. The Messiah, Isa the son of Maryam, was only a messenger of Allah and His word which He communicated to Maryam and a spirit from Him, so believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say, "Three," it will be better for you (if) you stop (saying it). Allah is only One God (and not one of the three as Christians claim). It is far from His Glory that He should have a son for Himself. Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is His and Allah is sufficient as a Trustee
The Messiah does not disdain to be a servant of Allah nor the angels who are near (Allah). And whoever disdains His service and considers himself great, He will gather all of them towards Himself
Then as for those who believe and do righteous works, He will give them their rewards in full and will increase for them (the reward by giving more) from His grace. And as for those who disdain and consider themselves great, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will not find for themselves any guardian or helper besides Allah
O mankind ! proof from your Fosterer has come to you and We have sent down to you a clear light
So as for those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will make them enter into mercy from Him and grace, and He will guide them towards Him on the straight path
They ask you for a legal decision, say, "Allah gives you a decision concerning the person who has neither parents nor children: If a man dies (and) he has no child, but has a sister, she shall have half of what he leaves, and he shall be her heir if she has no child; but if there be two (sisters) they shall have two thirds of what he leaves, and if there are brothers and sisters, then for the male is a share equal to two females. Allah makes (things) clear for you so that you should not commit a mistake, and Allah is the Knower of everything
O you who believe ! fulfill your obligations. Lawful for you are herbivorous cattle except those read to you. Hunting is unlawful for you while you are in the pilgrim’s dress. Allah certainly orders that which He intends
O you who believe ! do not violate the sanctity of the symbols of Allah nor the sacred month nor the offerings nor the victims with garlands nor those resorting to the Sacred House seeking the grace and pleasure of their Fosterer. And when you have removed your pilgrim dress (and are free from the obligations of the pilgrimage) then (you may) hunt. And do not let the hatred of a people who turned you away from the Sacred Mosque (earlier), incite you to exceed the limits. And help one another in righteousness and guarding (against evil) but do not help one another in sin and transgression and fear Allah, Allah is certainly severe in requiting (evil)
Forbidden to you as food are :-that which dies of itself and blood and flesh of swine and that on which any other name than that of Allah has been invoked and that killed by strangling and that beaten to death and that killed by a fall and that killed by being smitten by a horn and that which wild beasts have eaten except that you purify it (by properly slaughtering it in Islamic manner, while it is still alive) and that which is sacrificed on stones (before and for idols) and that you seek division with arrows (is also forbidden), that is transgression. "This day, those who do not believe have lost hope, (due to the success) of your religion, therefore do not fear them but fear Me. This day I have perfected your religion for you and completed My favour on you and I have chosen 'Al Islam' as the religion for you *." But (if) anyone is compelled by hunger (to eat something for that which is forbidden) without inclining towards sin, then Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful. * This statement is considered to be the last revelation. fear Me. This day I have perfected your religion for you and completed My favour on you and I have chosen 'Al Islam' as the religion for you *." But (if) anyone is compelled by hunger (to eat something for that which is forbidden) without inclining towards sin, then Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful. * This statement is considered to be the last revelation
They ask you what is lawful for them, say, "Lawful to you are good things and that which you have taught your trained hunting animals (to catch for you), teaching them from that which Allah has taught you, so eat from that which they catch for you and mention the name of Allah on it, and fear Allah, Allah is certainly Quick at (settling) the account
This day, lawful to you are good things, and the food of those who have been given the book is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them, and the chaste from the believing women and the chaste from those who have been given the book before you (are lawful to you for marriage), when you give them their dowries, being chaste, not fornicators, and not for taking them as girl friends; and one who rejects belief, then indeed this deeds are fruitless and in the hereafter he will be among he losers
O you who believe ! when you rise up for worship (salat), then wash your faces and your hands upto the elbows and wipe your heads and (wash) your feet upto the ankles and if you have not taken a bath after sexual intercourse (or passing out of semen during sleep etc.) then clean (your whole body by taking bath). And if you are on a journey or one of you comes from the toilet or you have touched women, then, (under the above circumstances) if you do not find water, or if you are sick, then take clean dust and wipe your faces and your hands with it. Allah does not intend to put any difficulty on you, but He intends to clean you that He may complete His favour on you so that you may be grateful
And remember the favour of Allah on you and your pledge with which He has bound you, when you said, "We hear and we obey," and fear Allah, Allah is certainly the Knower of that which is in the bosoms
O you who believe! be establishers of witnesses with justice for (the sake of) Allah. And do not let the hatred of a people incite you not to act justly. Do justice, that is nearer to guarding (against evil), and fear Allah, Allah is certainly informed of what you do
Allah has promised for those who believe and do righteous works, protective forgiveness and a great reward
And those who do not believe and deny Our signs, those are the inhabitants of hell
O you who believe ! remember the favour of Allah on you, when people planned to stretch their hands towards you but He held back their hands from you, and fear Allah, and let the believers put their trust in Allah
And Allah had indeed taken a pledge from the children of Israel. And We had raised among them twelve chieftains and Allah had said, "I am with you if you establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and believe in My messengers and assist them and loan to Allah a good loan, (then) I will definitely remove from you (the effect of) your evils and I will definitely make you enter the gardens beneath which rivers flow, so whoever among you does not believe after this, he has indeed gone astray (from the) balanced way
So because of their breaking their pledge, We cursed them and made their hearts hard. They alter the words from their (proper) places (in the book) and forget a part of that which they were reminded with, and you will not cease to discover betrayal of trust on their part except (from) a few of them, so pardon them and overlook, Allah certainly loves the doers of good
And from those who say, "We are Christians," We had taken a pledge from them (too), but they forgot a part of that which they were reminded with, therefore We excited enemity and hatred among them till the day of resurrection, and Allah will inform them about that which they did
O owners of the book ! Our messenger has come to you making clear to you much of that which you used to hide from the book and passing over (or exempting) much. There has indeed come to you a light and a clear book from Allah. come to you a light and a clear book from Allah
Allah guides through it, him who follows His pleasure, to the ways of peace, and brings them out from darkness into light by His order and He guides them to the straight path
They have indeed not believed who say, "Allah is certainly the Messiah, the son of Maryam." Say, "Then who has power against Allah in anything, if He intends to destroy the Messiah, the son of Maryam and his mother and whoever is on the earth, all together?" And the kingdom of the skies and the earth and (all) that is between them is Allah's. He creates that which He wills and Allah has power over everything
The Jews and the Christians say, "We are sons of Allah and His loved ones." Say, "Then why does He punish you for your sins? No ! you are but human beings from among those whom He created. He protectively forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. And the kingdom of the skies and the earth and (all) that is between them is Allah's and towards Him is the (final) destination
O owners of the book ! Our messenger has come to you (for) making (things) clear to you, after an interval (in the coming) of messengers, lest you say, "There did not come to us a conveyer of good news or a warner." So there has come to you a conveyer of good news and a warner, and Allah has power over everything
And when Musa said to his people, "O my people ! remember the favour of Allah upon you when He appointed among you prophets and He made you kings and gave you that which He did not give to anyone (else) in the worlds
O my people ! enter the holy land which Allah has prescribed for you and do not turn on your backs, (and if you do so) then you will turn back as losers
They said, "O Musa ! there are people therein who are exceedingly strong, and we will not enter it till they go out from it, but if they go out from it then we will enter
Two men, from among those who feared (Allah) and whom Allah had favoured, said, "Enter upon them through the gate, so when you enter it then you will be victorious, and put your trust in Allah if you are believers
They said, "O Musa ! we will never enter it while they are in it, so you and your Fosterer go and fight, we will certainly sit here
He said, "My Fosterer ! I do not have control except on myself and my brother, so effect separation between us and the transgressing people
He said, "So the (land) will be forbidden to them for forty years, they will wander in the earth, so do not grieve for the transgressing people
And recite to them the true story of the two sons of Adam, when they both offered an offering, but it was accepted from one of them and was not accepted from the other (who) said, "I will definitely kill you." (The other) said, "Allah accepts only from those who guard (against evil)
if you stretch your hand towards me to kill me I will not stretch my hand towards you to kill you, I fear Allah the Fosterer of the worlds
I intend that you should bear my sin as well as your own sin so that you should be among the inhabitants of hell and that is the reward of the unjust
So his soul willed for him, the murder of his brother, he thus killed him and thereby became one of the losers
Then Allah sent a crow scratching the earth to show him how to hide his brother's dead body. He said, "Sorrowful is my state, was I unable to be equal even to this crow so as to hide the dead body of my brother?" He thus became one of those who regret
For that reason, We prescribed for the children of Israel that whoever kills anyone without (it being a killing of the murderer of) someone, or due to corruption in the earth, then it will be as if he killed all human beings; and whoever saves a life then it will be as if he saved the lives of all human beings. And Our messengers had come to them with clear proofs, then even after that many of them are committers of excesses in the earth
The only reward of those who wage a war against Allah and His messenger and strive in the earth (to cause) corruption ( in it), is that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and feet should be cut off from opposite sides or they should be sent on exile from the land. That is their disgrace in the world, and in the hereafter there is a great punishment for them
except those who repent before you overpower them*, so know that Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful. * Catch them for punishment
O you who believe ! fear Allah and seek the means of approach to Him and strive in His way so as to be successful
As for those who do not believe, even if all that is in the earth were theirs and the like of it with it*, to give as ransom for the punishment on the day of resurrection, it will certainly not be accepted from them and for them there will be a painful punishment. * Double
They will intend to come out of the fire but they will not be able to come out of it and for them there will be a lasting punishment
And the male thief and the female thief, cut off their hands, a reward for that which they earned, an exemplary punishment from Allah, and Allah is Mighty, Wise
But whoever repents after his injustice and amends, then Allah will turn to him (mercifully), Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Do you not know that Allah's is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, He punishes whom He wills and He protectively forgives whom He wills, and Allah has power over everything
O messenger ! do not let those persons grieve you, who rush towards infidelity from among those who say with their mouths, "We believe," but their hearts do not believe and from those who are Jews, listeners of falsehood, listeners on behalf of other people who have not come to you, they alter the words after (knowing) their proper places, saying, "If you are given this then take it and if you are not given this then be cautious." And for him, whose trial Allah intends, you will never have any power for him against Allah, those are the persons for whom Allah does not intend to clean their hearts. For them there is disgrace in the world and there is a great punishment for them in the hereafter
Listeners of falsehood, eaters of the forbidden (things), so if they come to you then judge between them or keep away from them, and if you keep away from them, they can never harm you in any way, and if you judge, then judge between them with justice, Allah certainly loves those who are just
And how do they make you a judge when they have the Torah with them, in which is the judgment of Allah? Then they will turn back even after that (i.e. after your judgment), and they are not with the believers
We had sent down the Torah, in it was guidance and light, the prophets who had submitted, had based their judgment on it for (judging) those who were Jews, (and so did) the rabbis and the priests, because they were required to guard the book (law) of Allah and they were witnesses over it. So do not fear human beings but fear Me and do not sell My signs for a small price, and whoever does not base his judgment on that which Allah has sent down (as Divine communication), then those are the infidels
And We had prescribed for them therein that: The life for the life, and the eye for the eye, and the nose for the nose, and the ear for the ear, and the tooth for the tooth, and for the wounds retaliation, but whoever forgoes it as charity (by not retaliating) then that (forgoing of his) will wipe off (the effect) of his (evil). And whoever does not judge by that which Allah has sent down, then those are the unjust. wipe off (the effect) of his (evil). And whoever does not judge by that which Allah has sent down, then those are the unjust
And We caused Isa, the son of Maryam, to follow in their (the earlier prophets) footsteps, confirming that which was before him of the Torah and We gave him the Injeel, in itwas guidance and light, and a confirmation of that which was before it of the Torah and a guidance and an admonition for those who guard (against evil)
And the owners of the Injeel should judge by that which Allah has sent down in it, and whoever does not judge by that which Allah has sent down, then those are the transgressors
And We have sent down to you the book (Quran) containing the truth, a confirmation of what was before it of the book (Divine Law) and a guardian over it (earlier Divine Law), so judge between them by that which Allah has sent down and do not follow their desires (turning away) from the truth which has come to you. For everyone of you We have appointed a law and a way (to follow the law). And had Allah willed He would have made you a single community, but (He did not do so) to test you through that which He has given you, so compete in good deeds. Towards Allah is your return, of all (of you), then He will inform you about that in which you used to differ
And (We repeat) that (you should) judge between them by that which Allah has sent down, and (that you should) not follow their desires, and be cautious of them lest they turn you away from part of that which Allah has sent down to you. Then if they turn back, then know that Allah intends to afflict them on account of some of their sins, and many of the human beings are certainly transgressors
Then, do they seek the judgment of ignorance? And for a people who have certainty, who is better than Allah in judgment
O you who believe ! do not take the Jews and the Christians as friends, they are friends of each other, and whoever among you turns to them (for friendship), then he is certainly of them, and Allah certainly does not guide unjust people. and Allah certainly does not guide unjust people
So you see those in whose hearts is a disease, hastening towards them (for friendship) saying, "We fear lest a change of fortune should befall us." But perhaps Allah will bestow (you) with victory or (send some other) commandment from His presence, then they will become regretters over that which they had hidden in their souls (minds)
And those who believe will say, "Are these the persons who swore by Allah, being strong in their oaths, that they were with you?" Their deeds have become fruitless therefore they have become losers
O you who believe ! If anyone among you turns back from his religion (Islam), then Allah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him, humble towards the believers, mighty over the infidels, striving in the way of Allah and not fearing the blame of anyone who blames. That is the grace of Allah, He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is Omnipresent (Ample giving), Knowing
Your friends are only Allah and His messenger and those who believe, those who establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and they bow down
And whoever turns (for friendship) to Allah and His messenger and those who believe, then (the members of this) team of Allah, they are certainly the victors
O you who believe ! do not take as friends those who take your religion as mockery and sport, from among those who were given the book before you and the infidels; and fear Allah if you are believers
And when you call for worship (salat), they take it as a mockery and sport, that is because they are a people who do not have sense
Say, "O owners of the book ! do you hate us (for anything) else than that we believe in Allah and that which is sent down to us and that which was sent down before?" And that, "Most of you are transgressors
Say, "Shall I inform you of (something) worse than that in reward from Allah? (The cases of: him) whom Allah cursed and with whom He was angry and (those) from among whom He made apes and swine, and who served false deities, those are worse in position and far away from the balanced way
And when they come to you they say, "We believe," whereas they had entered with infidelity (in their hearts) and they indeed went out with it, and Allah knows best that which they hide
And you see many of them hastening towards sin and transgression and eating the forbidden, evil is that which they do
Why do the rabbis and the priests not forbid them from their sinful speech and their eating the forbidden. Evil is the work which they do
The Jews say, "Allah's hand is tied up." Their hands be tied up and they be cursed because of what they say. No ! both His hands are spread out, He spends as He wills. And that which is sent down to you from your Fosterer will definitely increase rebellion and infidelity in many of them. And We have put enemity and hatred among them till the day of resurrection. Whenever they kindle a fire for war Allah extinguishes it and they strive for corruption in the earth and Allah does not like those who are corrupt
And had the owners of the book believed and guarded (against evil), We would have wiped off from them (the effect of) their evils and We would have made them enter gardens of bliss
And had they established the Torah and the Injeel and that which is sent down to them from their Fosterer, they would have eaten from above them and from beneath their feet. Among them is a community which is moderate but many of them, evil is that which they do
O messenger ! convey (the message) which is sent down to you from your Fosterer, and if you do not do it, then you have not conveyed His message. And Allah will protect you from mankind, Allah certainly does not guide a people who are infidels
Say, "O owners of the book ! you are on nothing till you establish the Torah and the Injeel and that which is sent down to you from your Fosterer." And that which is sent down to you from your Fosterer will definitely increase rebellion and infidelity in many of them, therefore, do not grieve over a people who are infidels
Those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabaeans and the Christians, whoever believes in Allah and the period hereafter and does righteous work, then certainly, there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve
We had indeed taken a pledge from the children of Israel and We had sent messengers to them. Whenever there came to them a messenger with that which their souls did not desire, some (of the messengers) they denied while others they killed
And they thought that there will be no affliction, therefore they became blind and deaf, then Allah turned to them (mercifully) but again many of them became blind and deaf, and Allah is a Seer of what they do
hey have indeed not believed who say, "Allah is certainly the Messiah, the son of Maryam." Whereas the Messiah had said, "O children of Israel ! serve Allah, my Fosterer and your Fosterer, whoever associates partners with Allah, then Allah has forbidden to him the garden and his settling place will be the fire, and there will be no helpers for the unjust
They have indeed not believed who say, "Allah is certainly the third of the three," whereas there is no (other) god except the One God, and if they do not desist from what they say, a painful punishment will fall on those of them who do not believe
Then why do they not turn to Allah (in repentance) and seek His protective forgiveness when Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
The Messiah, the son of Maryam, was but a messenger, messengers have indeed passed before him, and his mother was a truthful woman, they both used to eat food, see how We make the signs clear for them, then see how they are turned away (from the truth)
Say, "Do you serve, besides Allah, something which has no power to harm or benefit you, while Allah is Hearing, Knowing
Say, "O owners of the book ! do not commit excesses in your religion without having the right to do so, and do not follow the desires of the people who went astray before (you) and led many (others) astray and went astray from the balanced way
Those who did not believe from among the children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of Dawood and Isa, the son of Maryam. That was because they disobeyed and they exceeded the limits
They did not forbid one another from (things) not recognised (as good) which they used to do, evil was that which they used to do
You see many of them turning (in friendship) towards those who do not believe, evil is that which their souls have sent forth for them, (because of ) that Allah is displeased with them and they will stay in the punishment
And had they believed in Allah and the prophet and that which is sent down to him, they would not have taken them as friends, but many among them are transgressors
You will definitely find the strongest in enemity among human beings, to those who believe, (to be) the Jews and those who are polytheists; and you will definitely find the nearest in love to those who believe, (to be ) those who say, "We are Christians," that is because, among them are priests and monks and they do not consider themselves great
And when they hear that which is sent down to the messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of their recognition of the truth. They say, "Our Fosterer ! we believe, so write us down with those who bear witness
And what (reason) do we have that we should not believe in Allah and in the truth that has come to us? And we hope that our Fosterer will make us enter with the righteous people
So Allah rewarded them, for that which they said, (with) gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein, and that is the reward of the doers of good
And those who do not believe and deny Our signs, they are the inhabitants of hell
O you who believe ! do not make unlawful, the good things which Allah has made lawful for you and do not exceed the limits, Allah certainly does not like those who exceed the limits
And eat from lawful good things which Allah has provided for you, and fear Allah in Whom you are believers
Allah will not catch you for that which is vain (unintentional) in your oaths, but He will catch you for the oaths with which you are earnestly tied up. Then for its expiation (so as to wipe off the ill effect of breaking such deliberate oaths you should) feed ten poor persons with the normal food with which you feed your own people or clothe them or set free a slave, but whoever does not find (the means to do any of the above three) then he should fast for three days. That is for the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn, but guard your oaths. Thus Allah makes clear to you His signs that you may be grateful
O you who believe ! intoxicants and games of chance and stones (set up around Kaaba for sacrificing animals, idols) and divining arrows * are only an uncleanliness from the devil's work, so avoid it that you may be successful * Casting lots with arrows
The only intention of the devil is to cause enemity and hatred to befall among you through intoxicants and games of chance, and to turn you away from Allah's remembrance and worship (salat). Will you then desist
And obey Allah and obey the messenger and be cautious, then if you turn away, know that (the duty incumbent) on Our messenger is only clear conveyance (of the message)
There is no sin on those who believe and do righteous works in what they ate (in ignorance), when they (later) restrained (themselves from prohibited food) and believed and did righteous works, then restrained (themselves from evil) and again believed, then restrained (themselves from evil) and did good works and Allah loves the doers of good
O you who believe ! Allah will definitely test you some what in respect of the game * which your hands and your spears can reach, that Allah may know (mark out) him who fears Him without having seen Him; so whoever exceeds the limits after that, then for him there is a painful punishment. * Hunting animals
O you who believe ! do not kill the game while you are in the pilgrim's dress, and whoever among you kills it intentionally, then the compensation (as fine for it) the like of what he killed of the cattle, decided by two just persons from among you, to be brought to Kaaba as an offering; or the expiation (of it) is the feeding of the poor or the equivalent of that is fasting, that he may taste the evil consequence of his affair (of disobedience). Allah has pardoned that which was done in the past but whoever returns (to it), Allah will inflict retribution on him, and Allah is Mighty, Inflicter of retribution
Lawful to you is the game of the sea and its eating, a provision for you and for the travelers, and unlawful to you is the game of land as long as you are in the pilgrim's dress, and fear Allah towards Whom you will be gathered
Allah has made the Kaaba, the Sacred House, an establishment for human beings, and (also) the sacred month and the offerings and the victims with garlands, that is so, that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth and that Allah is the Knower of everything (Omniscient). nd the offerings and the victims with garlands, that is so, that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth and that Allah is the Knower of everything (Omniscient)
Know that Allah is severe in requiting (evil) and (also) that Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Nothing (is incumbent) on the messenger except the conveyance (of the message) and Allah knows that which you expose and that which you hide
Say, "The bad and the good are not equal even though the abundance of bad may make you wonder, then fear Allah, O men of understanding ! that you may be successful
O you who believe ! do not ask about things which if made known to you, would trouble you, and if you ask about them while the Quran is being sent down (then) they will be made known to you, Allah pardoned you for this and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Clement
People before you indeed asked (questions), then became infidels due to it (probably by not following the answers given to them)
Allah has not appointed the making of Bahira (a slit-ear she camel), or a Saibah (a she camel let loose for free pasture), or a Wasilah (idol sacrifice for twin births in animals), or a Hami (stallion camel freed from work), but those who do not believe forge a lie against Allah and the majority of them does not understand
And when it is said to them, "Come to that which Allah has sent down and to the messenger," they say, "That on which we found our fathers is enough for us." What ! even if their fathers had no knowledge of anything and were not guided
O you who believe ! on you (is the responsibility of) yourselves. He who has gone astray cannot harm you when you are guided; you will all return to Allah, then He will inform you of what you did
O you who believe ! when death approaches one of you, let there be witnesses between you at the time of making bequest, two just men from among you or two others from other than you, if you are journeying in the earth and the calamity of death befalls you, then detain the two (witnesses) after the worship (salat), if you doubt (their honesty) then let them swear by Allah (saying), "We will not sell (the testimony) for (any) price, though there be a relative (involved in the benefit) and we will not hide the evidence of Allah, in that case we will be among the sinners
But if it becomes known that both of the (witnesses) have been guilty of sin, then two others (nearest in relationship) should stand in their place from among those who have claim against the (earlier witnesses, that they were wrong), then swear by Allah, "Our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not exceeded the limits, in which case we will be of those who are unjust
(If this procedure is followed) it is more likely that they (first set of two witnesses) will come out with evidence as it really appears to be, or (else) they will fear that other oaths will be taken after their oaths; and fear Allah and listen, and Allah does not guide a people who are transgressors
The day Allah will gather the messengers then say, "What was the response you got?" They will say, "We have no knowledge, You are certainly the Great Knower of unseen things
When Allah will say, "O Isa, the son of Maryam ! remember My favour on you and on your mother, when I strengthened you with the holy spirit you were made to speak to people in the cradle (childhood) and in old age, and when I taught you the book and the wisdom and the Torah and the Injeel, and when you proportioned from the clay a form like that of a bird by My permission then you breathed in it so it became a bird by My permission, and you healed the blind by birth and the leper by My permission, and when you brought out the dead by My permission, and when I withheld the children of Israel from (harming) you when you came to them with clear proofs, then those who did not believe from among them said: This is nothing but clear magic
And when I communicated to the disciples that they should believe in Me and My messenger, they said, "We believe and you bear witness that we submit (as Muslims)
When the disciples said, "O Isa, the son of Maryam ! is your Fosterer able to send down to us a table (set with food), from the sky?" He said, "Fear Allah if you are believers
They said, "We intend to eat from it and satisfy our hearts and know that you have indeed told us the truth, and that we may be witnesses over that
Isa, the son of Maryam said, "O Allah ! our Fosterer, send down on us a table (set with food), from the sky, that it may be a feast for us, for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You, and provide us (with sustenance) and You are the Best of the providers
Allah said, "I will send it down to you, then whoever does not believe from among you, (even) after that, I will punish him with a punishment with which I will not punish anyone in the worlds
And when Allah will say, "O Isa, the son of Maryam ! did you say to mankind: Take me and my mother as two gods, besides Allah?" He will say, "Glory be to You. It does not befit me that I should say something for which I have no right (to say). Had I said it then You would have indeed known it, You know that which is in my soul (mind/heart), whereas I do not know that which is in your Soul (Mind/Heart). You are certainly a Great Knower of the unseen things
did not say to them anything except that which You commanded me to (say), that : Serve Allah my Fosterer and your Fosterer, and I was a witness over them as long as I was among them, then when You took me back, You were Vigilant over them and You are a Witness over everything
If You punish them they are Your servants and if You protectively forgive them, then You are certainly the Mighty, the Wise
Allah will say, "This is a day when their truth will benefit the truthful, for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein for ever," Allah will be pleased with them and they will be pleased with Him, that's the great achievement
Allah's is the kingdom of the skies and the earth and that which is in them and He has power over everything
Praise is due only for Allah, Who created the skies and the earth and made the darkness and the light, (even) then those who do not believe equate others with their Fosterer
He it is Who created you from clay then decreed a term and there is a term named with Him, (even) then you doubt
And He is Allah in the skies and in the earth, He knows that which you hide and that which you manifest and He knows that which you earn
And there did not come to them any sign from the signs of their Fosterer but they turned away from it
Thus they denied the truth when it came to them, so the news of that which they mocked at, will come to them
Did they not see, how many a generation We destroyed before them, whom We had established in the earth more firmly than We have established you, and on whom We had sent abundant rain (from) the sky and (thereby) made the rivers to flow beneath them? Then We destroyed them for their sins and We raised after them another generation. tion
And had We sent down to you a writing on a page so that they could touch it with their hands (even then) those who did not believe would have said, “This is nothing but clear magic.”
And they say ask "why has not an angel been sent down to him?" And had We sent down an angel, then the matter would have been decided (and) after that they would not have been allowed time (to amend)
And had We made an angel (Our messenger), We would have made him a man (so that he could be seen and heard delivering the message) and (thus) We would have (further) confused them (in a matter) in which they are already confused
And messengers before you were mocked at, so, that which they mocked at, surrounded those who mocked from among them
Say, "Travel in the earth then see how the end of those who denied (the truth) was (brought about)
Say, "Whose is (all) that is in the skies and the earth?" Say, "Allah's." He has prescribed mercy on Himself. He will definitely gather you on the day of resurrection, there is no doubt in it. Those who caused loss to themselves, they will not believe
And His is that which dwells in the night and the day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing
Say, "Should I take (as) a guardian (someone) other than Allah, the Initiator of the creation of the skies and the earth, when He feeds(others) and is not fed (by others)?" Say, "I am commanded that I should be the first of those who submit, and you should not be of the polytheists
Say, "I fear the punishment of the great day, if I disobey my Fosterer
He from whom it is turned away on that day, (then Allah) has indeed shown (His) mercy to him, and that is a clear achievement
And if Allah afflicts you with harm, then there is no one who can remove it but He, and if He gives you (something) good, then He has power over everything
And He is Omnipotent (All Powerful) over His servants and He is the Wise, the Informed
Say, "What thing is greater (as) witness?" Say, "Allah is Witness between me and you. And this Quran has been communicated to me, that with it, I should warn you and whomsoever it reaches. Do you really bear witness that there are other gods with Allah?" Say, "I do not bear witness." Say, "He is only One God, and I am free from that which you associate as partners (with Allah)
Those to whom We have given the book, recognise him as they recognise their sons. Those who caused loss to themselves, they do not believe
And who is more unjust than he who fabricates a lie against Allah or denies His signs, the unjust will not be successful
And one day We will gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated partners (with Us), "Where are those whom you claimed (that they were Our) partners
Then they will be tempted to do nothing but to say, "By Allah our Fosterer, we were not polytheists
See how they will lie against themselves, and that which they had fabricated will go away from them
And among them is he who seeks to hear you but We have put veils on their hearts lest they understand and in their ears is heaviness, and (even) if they see every sign they will not believe in it, to the point that, when they come to you they will dispute with you. Those who do not believe say, "These are nothing but stories of the ancient." it, to the point that, when they come to you they will dispute with you. Those who do not believe say, "These are nothing but stories of the ancient
And they forbid (others) from it and (they themselves) go far away from it and they do not destroy anyone except themselves but they do not perceive
And if you could only see them when they would be made to stand before the fire, then they would say, "We wish, we were sent back, (then) we will not deny the signs of our Fosterer and we will be of the believers
No, that which they used to hide earlier will become manifest to them; and (even) if they are sent back they will return to that which they are forbidden and they are liars
And they say, "There is nothing except our life of this world and we will not be raised (again to life)
And if you could only see them when they would be made to stand before their Fosterer, He will say, "Is this not real?" They will say, "Why not, by our Fosterer (it is real)." He will say, "Then taste the punishment because you used to reject (the truth)
They indeed have lost who deny their meeting with Allah, until when the hour of doom comes on them suddenly, (then) they say, "Alas ! our regrets on our neglecting it." And they will bear their burdens on their backs. Is not what they bear, an evil
And the life of this world is nothing but sport and pastime, whereas the home of the hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil). Do you not then understand
We indeed know that what they say grieves you, they do not deny you, but the unjust knowingly deny the signs of Allah
And messengers before you were indeed denied but they were patient on being denied and on being annoyed, until Our help came to them. And there is none to change the words of Allah; and the news of the messengers has come to you
And if their keeping away (from your message) is a great (disappointment) for you, then if you can, seek a tunnel in the earth or a ladder (to ascend) into the sky, then come to them with a sign (miracle, still they will not believe). And had Allah willed, He would have gathered all of them on guidance, so do not be of those who are ignorant
Only those will respond, who listen. And the dead, Allah will raise them up, then to Him they will be returned
And they say, "Why has not a sign (miracle) been sent down on him from his Fosterer?" Say, "Allah certainly has the power to send down a sign but the majority of them does not know
And there is not an animal in the earth nor a bird that flies on its two wings but they are communities (species) like that of yours, We have not neglected anything in the book, then they will be gathered towards their Fosterer
And those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb in darknesses. Whom Allah wills, He sends him astray, and whom He wills, He puts him on the straight path
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes upon you or the hour of doom comes upon you, (then) will you pray (for help) to someone other than Allah, if you are truthful
No ! you will pray to Him alone, then He will remove that for which you prayed to Him, if He wills, and you will forget those whom you used to associate as partners (with Allah)
And We had sent (messengers) to communities before you, then We afflicted them with distress and harm that they might humble themselves
Then why did they not humble themselves, when distress from Us came to them? On the contrary, their hearts hardened and the devil made fair seeming to them, that which they did
So when they forgot that with which they were admonished, We opened for them the gates of everything, until, while they were rejoicing in that which was given to them, We suddenly caught them, so then they were in utter despair
So the root of the people who were unjust was cut off. And praise is due only for Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds
Say, "Have you considered, if Allah were to take away your hearing and your sight and set a seal on your hearts, who is the god other than Allah who could bring them (back) to you?" See how We repeat the signs (for their understanding), even then they turn away
Say, "Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah comes to you suddenly or openly, will anyone else be destroyed except the unjust people
And We do not send the messengers except as conveyers of good news and warners, so whoever believes and does righteous works, then there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve
And those who deny Our signs, the punishment will afflict them because they used to transgress
Say, "I do not say to you that with me are treasures of Allah nor that I know the unseen, and I do not say to you that I am an angel. I do not follow anything except that which is communicated to me." Say, "Are the blind and the seeing equal, then why do you not reflect
And warn through the (Quran) those who fear that they will be gathered towards their Fosterer, there will be no guardian for them besides Him and there will be no mediator, that they may guard (themselves against evil)
And do not drive away those who pray to their Fosterer in the morning and the evening intending (to seek) His Attention, you are not accountable for them in anything and they are not accountable for you in anything, so that (by) your driving them away you become (one) of the unjust
And thus do We test some of them through others, so that they say, "Are these the persons upon whom Allah has showered His favour from among us?" Is not Allah the Best Knower of those who are grateful
And when those who believe in Our signs come to you, then say (to them), "Peace be on you, your Fosterer has prescribed mercy on Himself, so if anyone of you did evil in ignorance then repented after that and amended, then He is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And thus do We explain the signs that the way of the criminals may become clear
Say, "I am forbidden to serve, those whom you pray to, besides Allah," Say, "I will not follow your desires, (and in case I did) then indeed I would go astray and I would not be of those who are guided
Say, "I am on a clear proof from my Fosterer, whereas you deny it. (The punishment) which you want to be hastened is not with me, the decision (to bring it about) is with none but Allah. He narrates the truth and He is the Best of judges
Say, "Had (the punishment) which you want to be hastened been with me, then the affair between me and you would have been decided, and Allah knows best those who are unjust
And with Him are the keys of the unseen, no one knows it but He. And He knows that which is in the land and the sea, and there does not fall a leaf but He knows it, nor a grain in the darkness of the earth, nor anything wet nor dry, but it is (recorded) in a clear record
And He it is Who takes you back at night (by taking away your consciousness during your sleep) and He knows how you keep yourselves busy during the day, then He raises you up therein (day, by returning your consciousness) that you may fulfill the appointed term, then towards Him is your return, then He will inform you of that which you used to do
And He is Omnipotent (All Powerful) over His servants. And protectors are sent over you by Him (and they protect you), until when death comes to one of you, Our messengers take him back (cause him to die) and they do not neglect
Then they are returned to Allah their Real Guardian. Beware ! His is the judgment, and He is the Swiftest in (settling) the account
Say, "Who delivers you from the darkness (distresses) of the land and the sea (when) you pray to Him humbly and in secret, (saying): If He delivers us from this we will definitely be of those who are grateful
Say, "Allah delivers you from it and from every distress, then (even after that) you associate partners with Him
Say, "He is able to let loose on you punishment from above you or from beneath your feet or put you under the banners of (rival) parties and (thereby) make some of you taste the violence of others (as in communal riots or wars)." See how We repeat the signs that they may understand
And your people have denied it though it is the truth, say, "I am not a trustee over you
For every news there is a (fixed) place/time, and you will come to know
And when you see those who involve (themselves) in (vain talk) about Our signs then keep away from them until they involve (themselves) in some other issue, and if the devil causes you to forget, then do not sit with the unjust people after remembering it
And those who guard (against evil) are not accountable for them in anything, but (this is only) a reminder that they may be careful
And leave alone those who take their religion as sport and pastime and those whom the life of this world has deceived, but remind through it lest a soul be destroyed due to what it earned. There will be no guardian for it besides Allah and there will be no mediator and if it (tries to) compensate with every compensation it will not be accepted from it. Those are the persons who will be destroyed due to what they earned, there will be a drink of boiling water and a painful punishment for them because they did not believe
Say, "Shall we pray to (something), besides Allah, that neither profits us nor harms us, and shall we turn back on our heels, after Allah has guided us, like him whom the devils have made to wander in the earth in a confused (state), while his companions call him towards guidance, "Come to us?" Say, "Allah's guidance is certainly the guidance, and we are commanded that we should submit to the Fosterer of the worlds
and to establish worship (salat) and to fear Him; and He it is to Whom you will be gathered
And He it is Who created the skies and the earth in reality. And the day He says, "Be," so it is. His word is the truth and His will be the authority the day it will be blown into the trumpet (or structure of the universe) . Knower of the unseen and the seen and He is the Wise, the Informed
And when Ibrahim said to his father Azar, "Do you take idols as gods? I certainly see you and your people in clear error
And thus We showed to Ibrahim, the kingdom of the skies and the earth that he might be of those who have certainty
So when the night covered him he saw a planet*. He said, "This is my Fosterer," but when it set, he said, "I do not love those who set." * Probably Venus
Then when he saw the moon rising, he said, "This is my Fosterer," then when it set, he said, "If my Fosterer does not guide me I will definitely be among the people who are astray
Then when he saw the sun rising, he said, "This is my Fosterer, this is the greatest (of all I could see)," then when it set, he said, "O my people ! I am free from that which you associate as partners (with Allah)
I turn my attention towards Him Who initiated the creation of the skies and the earth, being upright, and I am not of the polytheists
And (when) his people argued with him, he said, "Do you argue with me about Allah Who has guided me, and I do not fear that which you associate as partners with Him, unless my Fosterer wills something. My Fosterer's knowledge extends over everything, will you not then be mindful
And how should I fear that which you associate as partners (with Allah) when you do not fear to associate partners with Allah for which He has not sent down any authority on you, so which of the two parties has more right for security, if you know
Those who believe and do not cover their belief with injustice, those are the persons for whom there is security and they are (rightly) guided
And that was Our argument which We gave to Ibrahim against his people, We elevate the grades of whom We will. Your Fosterer is certainly Wise, Knowing
And We granted him Ishaq and Yaqub, each did We guide, and earlier We had guided Nuh and from his descendants Dawood and Sulaiman and Iyub and Yusuf and Musa and Harun and thus do We reward those who do good
and Zakariyya and Yahya and Isa and Ilyas, each one was of the righteous
and Ismael and Elisha and Yunus and Lut and each one (of them) We preferred over (all others in) the worlds
and from among their forefathers and their descendants and their brothers, and We chose them and We guided them to the straight path
That's the guidance of Allah, He guides thereby whom He wills of His servants, and if they associate partners (with Allah), all that they used to do would become fruitless for them
Those were the persons to whom We gave the book (law) and the judgment and the prophet hood; but if these do not believe in it, then We have entrusted with it, a people who will not be infidels to it
Those were the persons whom Allah guided, therefore follow (religion) according to their guidance. Say, "I do not ask you for any reward for it; it is nothing but a reminder for the worlds
And they did not estimate Allah with the estimation due to Him when they said, "Allah did not send down anything on man." Say, "Who (then) sent down the book with which Musa had come, (in which there was) light and guidance for mankind, of which you have made (written) pages, (part of) which you manifest while you hide much, and (through which) you were taught that which you did not know, you and your forefathers?" Say, "Allah," then leave them sporting in their involvement (of vain talk)
And this book (Quran too), We have sent down, (it is ) blessed, confirming those (Divine books) which were before it, that you may warn the mother of cities(Mecca) and those around it; and those who believe in the hereafter believe in it and they are guardians of their worship (salat)
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or says, "Communication has come to me," when he has not been communicated with anything, and he who says, "I can (also) bring down the like of that which Allah has sent down." Could you but see when the unjust are engulfed in (the sufferings of) death and the angels stretch their hands (saying), "Bring out your souls. (This) day you will be rewarded with a shameful punishment because you used to speak about Allah (something) other than the truth, and you used to consider yourselves great with regard to (the acceptance) of His signs." about Allah (something) other than the truth, and you used to consider yourselves great with regard to (the acceptance) of His signs
And now you have come to Us alone as We had created you the first time, and you have left behind your backs (all) that We bestowed upon you, and We do not see with you your mediators (about) whom you claimed that they would be partners in your (affairs), (all the ties) between you have been cut off and that which you used to claim (as dependable) has gone away from you
(It is) certainly Allah Who splits the grain and the date-stone (seed). He brings out the living from the dead and He brings out the dead from the living. That is Allah, then how are you turned away (from the truth)
Splitter of the day break, and He has made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for keeping an account (of time). That is the programme of the Mighty, the Knowing
And He it is Who made for you the stars that you may guide yourselves by (using) them in the darknesses of the land and the sea. We have detailed the signs for a people who have knowledge
And He it is Who has produced you from a single soul, then (appointed for you) a place/time for staying (life) and a place/time for departure (death). We have detailed the signs for a people who have understanding
And He it is Who sends down water from the sky, then We bring out through it vegetation of every kind, then We bring out from it green (crop) from which We bring out grain piled up; and of the date palms, of the sheaths of it, come forth clusters of dates within reach; and gardens of grapes and olives and pomegranates, similar and dissimilar. Look at its fruit when they bear fruit and its ripening. In these there are certainly signs for a people who believe
And they make the jinn partners of Allah, whereas He created them, and they falsely attribute to Him sons and daughters without (having any) knowledge, glory be to Him and Highly Exalted is He above what they describe (about Him). (having any) knowledge, glory be to Him and Highly Exalted is He above what they describe (about Him)
Originator of the skies and the earth. How can He have a son when He has no consort? And He created everything and He is the Knower of everything
That is Allah your Fosterer, there is no god except Him, Creator of everything, so serve Him, and He is the Trustee over everything
Vision cannot comprehend Him, but He comprehends vision, and He is the Subtlety Informed
Visual Proofs have come to you from your Fosterer, so whoever sees, then it is for (the good of) his own soul and whoever is blind then (the harm of it) is on him (alone), and I am not a protector over you
And thus do We repeat the signs that they may say, "You have read," and that We may make it clear for a people who have knowledge
Follow that which is communicated to you from your Fosterer, there is no god except Him and keep away from the polytheists
And had Allah willed they would not have associated partners (with Him) and We have not made you a protector over them nor are you a trustee over them
And do not abuse those whom they pray to, besides Allah, lest, exceeding the limits, they abuse (back) Allah unknowingly. Thus have We made fair seeming to every community, their deeds, then to their Fosterer will be their return and He will inform them of that which they used to do
And they swear by Allah with their strong oaths, that if a sign comes to them they will definitely believe in it. Say, "Signs are only with Allah." And what will make you realize that (even) when the (sign) comes, they will not believe. elieve in it. Say, "Signs are only with Allah." And what will make you realize that (even) when the (sign) comes, they will not believe
And We will turn their hearts and their eyes since they did not believe in it the first time, and We will leave them blindly wandering on in their rebellion
And even if We had sent down angels to them, and the dead had spoken to them, and We had gathered for them every thing in front of them, (even then) they would not believe unless Allah wills it, and the majority of them is ignorant
And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy, devils (from among the) human beings and the jinn, some (of them) communicating to others (through) decoratively deceptive language, and had your Fosterer willed they would not have done it, so leave alone, them and that which they forge
so that the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter may incline to it, and that they may be pleased with it and that they may earn that which they are going to earn
Shall I then seek (as) a judge (someone) other than Allah, when He it is Who has sent down the book (law) to you detailing (judgment)? And those to whom We gave the book know that it has been sent down from your Fosterer, (and it) contains the truth, so do not be of those who doubt (it)
And perfected is the word of your Fosterer in truth and justice. None can change His words and He is the Hearing, the Knowing
And if you obey most of those who are in the earth, they will send you astray from the way of Allah, they follow nothing but conjecture and they do nothing but lie
Your Fosterer certainly knows best, him who goes astray from His way, and He knows best those who are guided
So eat of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned if you are believers in His signs
And why should you not eat of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned when He has explained to you what He has made unlawful for you, except that you become helpless by necessity to (eat) it? And certainly there are many who, without having (any) knowledge, lead (people) astray (only on the basis) of their desires, and your Fosterer certainly knows best those who exceed the limits
And forsake sin (whether) open or secret, those who earn sin will certainly be rewarded for that which they used to earn
And do not eat from that on which Allah's name has not been mentioned and that is certainly transgression. And the devils certainly communicate to their friends that they should dispute with you, and if you obey them then you will certainly become polytheists
Is he who was dead, then We gave him life and made for him a light by which he walks among people, like him whose likeness is (like one) in darknesses from where there is no (way of) coming out? Thus, that which the infidels do, is made fair seeming to them
And thus We have made in every city, (its) great ones its criminals that they may plan therein, and they do not plan but against their own souls but they do not perceive
And when there comes to them a sign, they say, "We will never believe unless we are given the like of that which was given to the messengers of Allah (earlier). Allah knows best where He should place His message. Humiliation from Allah and severe punishment will befall those who are criminals, for that which they used to plan
So, (for) whomsoever Allah intends that He should guide him, He opens his bosom for Islam, and (for) whomsoever He intends that He should leave him straying, He makes his bosom close and narrow as if he were ascending in the sky (when one gets suffocated due to lack of oxygen). Thus Allah lays uncleanliness on those who do not believe
And this is the straight path of your Fosterer. We have detailed the signs for a people who are mindful
For them there will be a home of peace with their Fosterer and He will be their Guardian because of that which they used to do
And one day He will gather them all together, "O assembly of jinn ! you indeed sought many of the human beings." And their friends from among the human beings will say, "Our Fosterer ! some of us profited through others and we have reached our term which You termed for us." He will say, "The fire is your home, therein you will stay," except as Allah wills, your Fosterer is certainly Wise, Knowing
And thus We make some of the unjust turn to others because of that which they used to earn
O assembly of jinn and human beings ! did there not come to you messengers from among you, narrating to you My signs and warning you of the meeting of this day of yours?" They will say, "We bear witness against ourselves." And the life of this world deceived them and they will bear witness against themselves that they used to be infidels
That is because your Fosterer does not destroy (any) city unjustly while its people are unaware (of the message)
And for everyone are grades in accordance with that which they do and your Fosterer is not unaware of what they do
And your Fosterer is Independent, Possessor of mercy, if He wills He can remove you and appoint whom He wills as successors after you, as He produced you from the descendants of other people
That which you are promised will certainly come to pass and you cannot defeat (it)
Say, "O my people ! work on whatever lines you choose to, I too am working, but you will come to know for whom (of us) will the home (of the hereafter) be the (good) end, the unjust will certainly not be successful
And they set aside a portion for Allah from that which He has produced of tilth (crop) and cattle and say, "This is for Allah," with their assertion. "And this is for our partners." But that which is for their partners does not reach Allah and that which is for Allah reaches their partners. Evil is ( the way in ) which they judge
And thus their partners have made fair seeming to many of the polytheists the killing of their children, that they may destroy them and that they may cause confusion for them (in) their religion, and had Allah willed they would not have done it. So leave alone, them and that which they forge
And they say, "These are the cattle and tilth forbidden, none shall eat them except whom we will." Thus they assert. And (there are) cattle whose backs are made unlawful and cattle over which they do not mention the name of Allah, forging (a lie) against Him. He will requite them because of that which they used to forge
And they say, "That which is in the wombs of these cattle is exclusively for our males and it is unlawful for our wives, but if it is born dead, then they are partners in it. He will reward them for their description, He is certainly Wise, Knowing
They who have killed their children foolishly without knowledge are at a loss and (those who ) have made unlawful that which Allah has provided for them, forging (a lie) against Allah, they have gone astray and they are not guided
And He it is Who produced gardens raised on structures of pillars (like vine yards) and not raised, and the date palms and the vegetation differing in the food (prepared from) them and the olive and the pomegranates similar and dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it bears fruit and give the (charity) due thereof on the day of its harvest and do not be extravagant, He certainly does not like the extravagant. olive and the pomegranates similar and dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it bears fruit and give the (charity) due thereof on the day of its harvest and do not be extravagant, He certainly does not like the extravagant
And of the cattle some are for carrying burden and some for slaughter (food). Eat of that which Allah has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of the devil, he is certainly your open enemy
Eight pairs, two of sheep and two of goats, say, "Has He made unlawful the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Inform me with knowledge if you are truthful
And two of camels and two of cows, say, "Has He made unlawful the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when Allah directed you with this?" So who is more unjust than him who forges a lie against Allah to mislead human beings without knowledge? Allah certainly does not guide the unjust people
Say, "I do not find in that which is communicated to me, anything made unlawful for an eater to eat except that it be what has died of itself, or flowing blood, or flesh of swine, for that is certainly unclean; or exceeding the limits (by) invoking on the (food, the name of someone) other than Allah; but whoever is helplessly necessitated (to eat), neither desiring nor exceeding the limits, then your Fosterer is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And on those who were Jews We had made unlawful every animal having claws, and of oxen and sheep We had made unlawful to them the fat of both, except that which adhered to their backs or the intestines or that mixed with the bone. We rewarded them with that because of their rebellion and We are certainly the Truthful
So if they deny you, then say, "Your Fosterer is the Possessor of omnipresent mercy, but His punishment will not be turned away from people who are criminals
Those who associate partners (with Allah) will say, "Had Allah willed we would not have associated partners (with Allah) nor our forefathers nor we would have made anything unlawful (by ourselves)." Thus did those before them deny, till they tasted Our punishment. Say, "Do you have any knowledge, then bring it out for us, you follow nothing but conjecture and you do nothing but lie
Say, "Then Allah's is the argument (that makes one) reach (the final conclusion); so had He willed He would have guided all of you
Say, "Come, bring your witnesses who should bear witness that Allah has made this unlawful." But if they bear witness, you do not bear witness with them, and do not follow the desires of those who deny Our signs and those who do not believe in the hereafter and make (others) equal to their Fosterer
Say, "Come I will read to you that which your Fosterer has made unlawful for you: (It is unlawful) that you should associate any partner with Him. And (you) should be good to parents and you should not kill your children because of (the fear of) poverty, We provide for you and for them too, and (you) should not go near indecencies (both) those of them which are open and those which are secret and (you) should not kill a soul (anyone, the killing of) whom Allah has made unlawful except in the cause of justice. That He directs you with, that you may understand
And you should not go near the wealth of the orphan, except in (a manner) that is best (having good intention), till the (orphan) reaches his (age of) maturity, and you should give back full measure and weight, with justice. We do not task a soul except to its capacity. And when you speak then (you) should be just, even if it be (against) a relative, and fulfill the agreement with Allah. That He directs you with, that you may be mindful
And that, this is My path, straight, so follow it and do not follow other ways which will part you from His way. That He directs you with, that you may guard (against evil)
Then We gave the book to Musa, complete for him who would do good, and an explanation of everything, and a guidance and mercy, that they may believe in the meeting with their Fosterer
And this is a blessed book which We have sent down, so follow it and guard (against evil) that you may be dealt with mercifully
lest you should say, that, "The book was sent down only to two parties before us and we were unaware of what they read
or you should say, "Had the book been sent down to us we would have been better guided than them." So a clear proof has come to you from your Fosterer, with guidance and mercy. Then who is more unjust than he who denies the signs of Allah and turns away from them. We will reward, those who turn away from Our signs, with an evil punishment because they used to turn away
Do they wait for anything else than that the angels should come to them or your Fosterer should come or some signs of your Fosterer should come. The day some signs of your Fosterer come, the believing of a soul (anyone, after seeing the signs on that day) will not profit him who neither believed earlier nor earned good through his belief. Say, "(All of you) wait, we too are certainly waiting
Those who divide their religion and become sects, you have nothing to do with them in anything, their affair is only with Allah, later He will inform them of what they used to do
Whoever comes with (one) good then (the reward) for him is ten (times) like it and whoever comes with (one) evil, he will be rewarded only with the like of it and they will not be dealt with unjustly
Say, "My Fosterer has certainly guided me to the straight path ( leading to ) the established religion (consisting of ) the religious dictates of Ibrahim the upright, and he was not of the polytheists
Say, "My worship (salat) and my sacrifice and my life and my death are for Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds
He has no partner and this I am commanded, and I am the first of those who submit (as Muslims)
Say, "Shall I seek a fosterer other than Allah, when He is the Fosterer of everything? And every soul earns only against itself, and no bearer of a burden will bear the burden of another, then to your Fosterer will be your return, and He will inform you of that in which you differed
And He it is Who made you successors of the earth, and raised the grades of some of you above others that He may test you through that which He has given you. Your Fosterer is certainly Quick in requiting while He is (also) Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Alif Laam Miim Saad
(This Quran is) a book sent down to you, so that through it you may warn (people), so let there be no difficulty in your heart on account of it, and it is reminder for the believers
Follow that which is sent down to you from your Fosterer and do not follow friends besides Him, little is it that you mind
And how many a city We destroyed, so Our punishment came to it by night or while they slept in the afternoon
And when Our punishment came to them, their cry was nothing except that they said, "We were certainly unjust
So We will definitely question those to whom We sent (Our messengers) and We will definitely question the messengers
Then We will definitely narrate to them with knowledge because We were never absent
And the weighing on that day will be true (correct). Then as for him whose weight (of good deeds) will be heavy, then those will be the persons who will be successful
And as for him whose weight (of good deeds) will be light, then those will be the persons who will cause loss to themselves because they used to be unjust to Our signs
And We have established you in the earth and We have made therein (means) of your livelihood, (but) the gratitude which you express is little
And We indeed created you (mankind) then gave you a form, then We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam," so they bowed down except Iblis, he was not of those who bowed down
He (Allah) said, "What prevented you, that you did not bow down when I commanded you?" He (Iblis) said, "I am better than him, You created me from fire whereas You created him from clay
He (Allah) said, "Then go down from it, because it does not befit you that you should consider yourself great in it, so get out, you are certainly of those who are degraded
He (Iblis) said, "Give me time till they are raised (after death on the day of resurrection)
He (Allah) said, "You are certainly of those who are given time
He (Iblis) said, "Because You have removed me from the way, I will definitely sit waiting for them (human beings) on Your straight path
then I will definitely come to them from before them and from behind them and from their right hand side and from their left hand side, and You will not find the majority of them grateful
He (Allah) said, "Get out of it, disgraced, driven away, whoever of them follows you, I will definitely fill hell with all of you
And O Adam ! you and your wife dwell in the garden and eat from wherever you will, but do not go near this tree, for then you will be of the unjust
But the devil whispered to them both, so as to make manifest to them that which was hidden from them of their shame, and said, "Your Fosterer has forbidden you this tree only (for the reason that after eating it), both of you will become angels or become immortals
And he swore to them both, "I am certainly a sincere adviser to you
Thus he caused them to fall through his deceit. So when they tasted of the tree their shame became manifest to them* and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden, and their Fosterer called out to them, "Did I not forbid you both (from going near) that tree and tell you both that the devil is certainly your open enemy?" *Probably earlier to this they too, like the animals, were not conscious of shame
They said, "Our Fosterer ! we have been unjust to ourselves and if You do not protectively forgive us and have mercy on us we will definitely be of those who are at loss
He (Allah) said, "Go down, some of you will be the enemies of others, and there is a place of stay and provision for you in the earth till a time
He (Allah) said, "In it you will live and in it you will die and from it you will be brought out
O children of Adam ! We have sent down to you clothing for hiding your shame and for good appearance, and clothing that guards (against evil), that is the best. That is of the signs of Allah that they may be mindful
O children of Adam ! do not let the devil tempt you as (he tempted and) got your parents (Adam and Hawwa driven) out of the garden, pulling off from both of them their clothing to show them their shame; he sees you, he and his tribe, from a place where you cannot see them. We have certainly made the devils friends of those who do not believe
And when they do anything indecent they say, "We found our fathers doing this and Allah has commanded us to do it." Say, "Allah certainly does not command anything that is indecent. Do you say about Allah that which you do not know
Say, "My Fosterer commands justice and (that you) set right your attention at every time/place of prostration (worship) and (then) pray to Him making religion exclusively for Him. You will return, in the manner in which He originated you
A party has He guided while (another) party, error is due on them (because) they have taken the devils as their friends besides Allah and they think that they are (rightly) guided
O children of Adam ! take (care of) your adornment (in dress) at every time/place of prostration (worship) and eat and drink and do not be extravagant, He certainly does not like those who are extravagant
Say, "Who has made unlawful the adornment and the good things from the provision of Allah which He has brought forth for His servants?" Say, "For those who believe, these are (the provisions) in the life of this world, (and they will be) exclusively (for them, on the) day of resurrection." Thus do We detail Our signs for a people who know. ur signs for a people who know
Say, "My Fosterer has made unlawful only the indecencies, those of them which are apparent and those which are secret, and sin, and rebellion without having the right to do so, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down any authority, and that you say about Allah that which you do not know
And for every community there is a (fixed) term, so when (the end of) their term comes they will neither be able to postpone the time nor advance it
O children of Adam ! whenever there come to you messengers from among you, narrating to you My signs, then whoever guards (against evil) and amends, then there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve
And those who deny Our signs and (turn away) from them considering themselves great, those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay in it
So who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or denies His signs? Those are the persons whose portion of (that which is written in) the book (as destiny) will reach them till Our messengers come to them to take them back (at the time of their death), (when) they will say, "Where are those whom you used to pray to, besides Allah?" They will say, "They have gone away from us," and they will bear witness against themselves that they were infidels
He will say, "Enter the fire with the communities which have passed away before you, from among the jinn and human beings." Whenever a community enters, it will curse its sister, (earlier community) until they follow each other into it, all together. The later of them will say regarding the former of them, "Our Fosterer ! these led us astray, so give them double punishment of the fire." He (Allah) will say, "For everyone there is double (punishment) but you do not know
And the former of them will say to the later of them, "So there is no preference for you over us, therefore taste the punishment for that which you used to earn
Those who deny Our signs and (turn away) from them considering themselves great, the gates of the sky will certainly not be opened for them and they will not enter the garden until the camel passes the eye of the needle, and thus do We reward the criminals
For them there will be a bed * in hell and coverings from above them, and thus do We reward the unjust. * Habitation
And those who believe and do righteous works, We do not task a soul (anyone) but to its capacity, those are the inhabitants of the garden, they will stay in it
And We will remove whatever of ill-feeling would be there in their hearts, rivers will flow beneath them and they will say, "Praise is due only for Allah, Who guided us to this and we would not have been guided had Allah not guided us. Messengers of our Fosterer indeed came to us with the truth." And it will be called out to them, that: "This is the garden, you have been made to inherit it because of that which you used to do
And the inhabitants of the garden will call out to the inhabitants of the fire (saying) that, "We have found that which our Fosterer promised us, to be true, so have you (too) found that which your Fosterer promised you, to be true?" They will say, "Yes." Then an announcer will announce among them that: "Curse of Allah is on the unjust
who turn away (people) from the way of Allah and seek to make it crooked and they are rejecters of the hereafter
And between them (there will be) a veil, and on the heights (from where one can recognise), there will be men who will recognise everyone by their marks and they will call out to the inhabitants of the garden (saying) that, "Peace be on you all." They would not have (yet) entered it though they would be in the hope (of entering it)
And when their eyes will turn towards the inhabitants of the fire, they will say, "Our Fosterer ! do not place us with the unjust people
And the inhabitants of the heights (from where one can recognise), will call out to the men whom they would recognise by their marks, saying, "Your collections (hoardings) and that in which you considered yourselves great, have not saved you (from the punishment)
Are these the persons about whom you swore that Allah will not bestow them with His mercy? Enter the garden, there will neither be any fear on you nor will you grieve
And the inhabitants of the fire will call out to the inhabitants of the garden (saying) that, "Pour out on us water or (something) of that which Allah has provided you." They will say, "Allah has certainly forbidden both (the things) for the infidels
who took their religion as sport and pastime and the life of the world deceived them." So this day We will forget them as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs, and because they used to knowingly reject Our signs
And We have indeed bestowed them with a book which We have explained in detail on (the basis of ) knowledge, a guide and a mercy for a people who believe
Do they wait for anything else than the fulfillment (of the promise made in the book)? The day its fulfillment comes, those who had forgotten it earlier will say, "Messengers of our Fosterer had indeed come with the truth. So are there any mediators for us, that they may mediate for us or could we be sent back so that we may do something other than that which we used to do?" They have indeed caused loss to themselves and that which they used to forge has gone away from them
Your Fosterer is certainly Allah Who created the skies and the earth in six periods, then He set the balance on the throne (of the universe) . He makes the night to cover the day, which (i.e. the day) seeks the (night) rapidly (in succession). And the sun and the moon and the stars are compelled to follow His command. Is not His the creation and he command? Blessed be Allah the Fosterer of the worlds
Pray to your Fosterer humbly and secretly, He certainly does not like those who exceed the limits
And do not act corruptly in the land after it has been set right. And pray to Him in fear and hope. Allah's mercy is certainly near those who are doers of good
And He it is Who sends the winds as bearers of good news before His mercy, until when they bring up a heavy cloud, (then) We drive it to a dead land, then We send down through it water, then We bring out through it fruits of every kind. Thus We bring out the dead. Perhaps you will me mindful
And [from] the land which is good its vegetation comes out by the permission of its Fosterer and [from the land] which is bad nothing comes out except a little [vegetation]. Thus do We repeat the signs for a people who are grateful
We had sent Nuh to his people, so he said [to them], "O my people ! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him, I fear for you the punishment of the great day
The leaders of his people said, "We certainly see you in clear error
He said, "O my people ! there is no error in me but I am a messenger from the Fosterer of the worlds
I convey to you the messages of my Fosterer and advise you, and I know from Allah that which you do not know
What ! do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Fosterer through a man from among you, that he may warn you and that you may guard (against evil) and that you may be dealt with mercifully
But they denied him so We delivered him and those with him in the ship and We drowned those who denied Our signs, they were certainly a blind people
And to (the tribe of) Aad, (We had sent) their brother Hud. He said (to them), "O my people ! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him, will you not then guard (against evil)
The leaders of those who did not believe from among his people said, "We certainly see you in foolishness and we certainly think that you are of the liars
He said, "O my people ! I am not in foolishness, but I am a messenger from the Fosterer of the worlds
I convey to you the messages of my Fosterer and I am a trustworthy adviser to you
What ! do you wonder that a reminder has come to you from your Fosterer through a man from among you that he may warn you? And remember when He made you successors after the people of Nuh and caused you to grow into an extensive creation (nation), so remember the bounties of Allah that you may be successful
They said, "Have you come to us (to tell us) that we should worship Allah alone and leave off (worshipping) that which our forefathers worshipped? Then bring to us that with which you threaten us, if you are of the truthful
He said, "Uncleanliness and anger from your Fosterer have already fallen on you. What ! do you dispute with me about names which you have named, you and your forefathers, for which Allah has not sent down any authority, then wait, I (too), with you, will be one of those who wait
So We delivered him and those with him by mercy from Us and We cut off the roots of those who denied Our signs and were not believers
And to (the tribe of ) Samood (We had sent) their brother Salih. He said (to them), "O my people! serve Allah, you have no god other than Him, clear proof has indeed come to you from your Fosterer, this is the she-camel of Allah, a sign for you, so leave her to pasture in Allah's earth and do not touch her to harm (her), otherwise a painful punishment will seize you
And remember when He made you successors after Aad and settled you in the earth, you build palaces in its plains and carve out houses in the mountains, so remember the bounties of Allah and do not cause disturbance in the earth being corrupt
The leaders of his people who considered themselves great, said to those who believed from among those who were considered weak, "Do you surely know that Salih is a messenger from his Fosterer?" They said, "Certainly, we are believers in that with which he has been sent
Those who considered themselves great said, "We do not believe in that which you believe
So they killed the she-camel and revolted against the commandment of their Fosterer and (then) they said, "O Salih ! bring on us what you threaten us with, if you are of the messengers (sent by Allah)
So the earthquake took hold of them, thus they became motionless in their houses
Then he (Salih) turned away from them and said, "O my people ! I had conveyed to you the message of my Fosterer and given you good advice but you do not love good advisers
And (We had sent) Lut, when he said to his people, "What ! do you commit an indecency which no one in the worlds has committed before you
You come to men with lust besides women. No ! you are an extravagant people
And the answer of his people was nothing except that they said, "Send them out of your city, they are people who want to be clean
So We delivered him and his followers except his wife, she was of those who stayed behind
And We rained on them a rain, then see how the end of the criminals was (brought about)
And to Midian (We had sent) their brother Shuaib, he said, "O my people ! serve Allah, you have no god other that Him. Clear proof has come to you from your Fosterer so give back full measure and weight, and (with regard to) goods, do not give to people anything which is less than what is due to them, and do not cause corruption in the earth after it has been set right. That is the best for you if you are believers
And do not sit on every road threatening and turning away from the way of Allah him who believes in Him, and seeking to make it crooked, and remember when you were few then He multiplied you, and see how the end of the corrupt was (brought about)
And if there is a party among you which believes in that which I am sent with and there is another party which does not believe, then be patient until Allah judges between us and He is the Best of judges
The leaders of those who considered themselves great form among his people said, "We will definitely send you out form our city, O Shuaib, and (also) those who believe with you or else you should return to our religious dictates." He said, " Even though we dislike it
We would forge a lie against Allah, if we return to your religious dictates after Allah has delivered us from it. And it is not for us to return to it unless Allah our Fosterer wills. Our Fosterer's knowledge extends over everything, we trust in Allah. Our Fosterer ! decide between us and our people with truth and You are the Best of judges
And the leaders of those who did not believe from among his people said, "If you follow Shuaib then you will certainly be losers
So the earthquake took hold of them, thus they became motionless in their houses
Those who denied Shuaib became as though they had not lived therein, who denied Shuaib, they were the losers
So he turned away from them and said, "O my people ! I had conveyed to you the messages of my Fosterer and given you good advice, then how should I feel sorry for a people who reject
And We did not send a (single) prophet to any city but We seized its people with distress and harm that they may humble themselves
Then We changed the evil for good, until (the good became) surplus and they said, "(Such) harm and happiness did afflict our forefathers (too)," then We seized them suddenly while they did not perceive
And had the people of the cities believed and guarded (against evil), We would have opened on them blessings from the sky and the earth, but they denied, so We seized them on account of what they used to earn
Are the people of the cities then secure from the distress that could come from Us on them at night while they are asleep
Or are the people of the cities secure from the distress that could come from Us on them in the day time while they are playing
Are they then secure from Allah's pain? So no one feels secure from Allah's plan except the people who are losers
Is (history) not a (source of ) guidance for those who inherit the earth after its (previous) inhabitants (who were destroyed for their sins) that if We will, We can afflict them (too), for their sins, and set a seal on their hearts so that they would not be able to hear? sins, and set a seal on their hearts so that they would not be able to hear
Those (are) the cities from whose histories We narrate to you, and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs, but they would not believe in that which they had denied earlier. Thus does Allah set a seal on the hearts of the infidels
And We did not find in most of them (faithfulness) in(their) agreement and We found most of them to be transgressors
Then after them, We sent Musa with Our signs to Firawn and his leaders, but they were unjust to them, so see how the end of the corrupt was (brought about)
And Musa said, "O Firawn ! I am a messenger from the Fosterer of the worlds
(It is) incumbent upon (me) that I should not speak anything about Allah except the truth. I have come to you with clear proof from your Fosterer so send the children of Israel with me
He (Firawn) said, "If you have come with a sign (from Allah) then bring it, if you are of the truthful
So he (Musa) threw his staff, when it became a clear serpent
and he drew forth his hand, when it became white for those who were seeing
The leaders of Firawn's people said, "This is certainly a learned magician
he intends to drive you out of your land, so what do you advise
They said, "Keep him and his brother (waiting in) hope, meanwhile send collectors into the cities
that they may come to you with every learned magician
And the magicians came to Firawn, saying, "There should certainly be a reward for us if we are victors
He said, "Yes, and you will be of those who are near (to me)
They said, "O Musa ! will you throw (show your magic first) or shall we be the first to throw
He said, "You throw (first)." So when they threw, they cast a magic on the eyes of the people and sought to frighten them, and they came out with a great magic
And We communicated to Musa that: "Throw your staff," so when it swallowed that which they had falsely devised
the truth was established and what they did was falsified
Thus they were defeated there and they returned degraded
And the magicians were made to fall down prostrate
saying, "We believe in the Fosterer of the worlds
Fosterer of Musa and Harun
Firawn said, "You believe in Him before I permit you? This is certainly a plan you have planned in the city so that you may drive out of it, its people, but you will know
I will definitely have your hands and your feet cut off from opposite sides, then I will definitely have you crucified all together
They said, "We will anyhow return to our Fosterer
and you do not take vengeance on us except (for the reason) that we believed in the signs of our Fosterer when they came to us. Our Fosterer ! pour out patience on us and take us back (make us die) as Muslims
And the leaders of the people of Firawn said, "Will you leave Musa and his people to cause corruption in the land and to leave you and your gods?" He said, "We will have their sons killed and leave their women alive, and we certainly have power over them
Musa said to his people, "Seek the help of Allah and be patient, the earth is certainly Allah's, He makes it to be inherited by whomever He wills from among His servants, and the end is (good) for those who guard (against evil)
They said, "We were harmed before you came to us and (even) after you came to us." He said, "It may be that your Fosterer will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land, then see how you act
And We indeed seized Firawn's people with famine and reduction of fruits that they may be mindful
So when good befell them, they said, "This is due to us," and when evil befell them, they ascribed it to the ill-luck of Musa and those with him. Beware ! their ill-luck is only with Allah, but the majority of them does not know
And they said, "Whatever sign you may bring to us, to influence us with its magic, we will not believe in you
So We sent on them the flood and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and the blood, signs explaining in detail (the power of Allah), but they considered themselves great and they were a criminal people. criminal people
And whenever the penalty befell them they said, "O Musa ! pray for us to your Fosterer by virtue of His agreement with you, if you remove the penalty from us we will definitely believe in you and we will definitely send the children of Israel with you
But whenever We removed the penalty from them for a term which they had to reach, then they broke (the promise)
So We inflicted retribution on them and drowned them in the flowing water (of the sea) because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them
And We made those people who were considered to be weak, inherit the eastern parts of the land and the western parts thereof which We had blessed, and the good word of your Fosterer was fulfilled for the children of Israel because of their patience. And We destroyed that which Firawn and his people had built and that which they had erected
And We took the children of Israel across the sea. Then they came across a people who were devoted to their idols. They said, "O Musa ! make for us a god like the gods they have," he said, "You are certainly an ignorant people
(as for) these, (the idol worship) in which they are (involved) will certainly be destroyed and that which they are doing is false
He said, "Should I seek for you, a god other than Allah, when He has favoured you above the worlds
And (remember) when We delivered you from the people of Firawn who afflicted you with an evil punishment : they killed your sons and left alive your women, and in that there was a great trial (for you) from your Fosterer
And We appointed for Musa thirty nights and completed them with ten (more), so he completed forty nights (as) the time appointed by his Fosterer. And Musa said to his brother Harun, "Succeed me (to be in charge, in my absence), of my people, and set right (things) and do not follow the way of those who are corrupt
And when Musa came at the time/place appointed by Us and his Fosterer spoke to him, he said, "My Fosterer ! show me (Yourself) that I may look at You." He said, "You cannot see Me, but look at the mountain, so if it stays in its place then you will (be able to) see Me." So when his Fosterer unveiled Himself to the mountain, He made it crumble to pieces and Musa fell down senseless. Then when he recovered he said, "Glory be to You ! I turn to You (for mercy) and I am the first of the believers
He said, "O Musa !I have chosen you above mankind by (selecting you for delivering) My messages and by My speaking (to you), so take hold of that which I give you and be of those who are grateful
And We prescribed for him in the tablets, admonition regarding everything and explanation of everything (saying), "So take hold of it with strength and command your people to take hold of it in the best (manner), I will show you the home of the transgressors
I will turn away from My signs those who exhibit greatness in the earth without having the right to do so, and even if they see every sign they will not believe in it, and if they see the right way, they will not take it as (their) way, but if they see the way of error, they will take it as (their) way. That is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them
And those who deny Our signs and the meeting of the hereafter, their deeds are fruitless. Will they be rewarded for anything other than that which they used to do
And the people of Musa, after he (had left), took (for worship) the (mere) body of a calf (which they had made) from their ornaments, the (calf) had a hollow sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them (to the right) way? They took it (for worship) and they were unjust. to the right) way? They took it (for worship) and they were unjust
And when they repented and saw that they had gone astray, they said, "If our Fosterer does not have mercy on us and protectively forgive us, we will definitely be of those who are losers
And when Musa returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said, "Evil is that with which you succeeded me after me. Did you (wish to) hasten the command of your Fosterer?" And he put down the tablets and seized his brother by the head, dragging him towards himself. He said, "Son of my mother ! the people certainly considered me weak and almost killed me, so do not make the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me with the people who are unjust
He said, "My Fosterer ! protectively forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy and You are the Most Merciful of those who are merciful
Those who took the calf (for worship), anger from their Fosterer will certainly reach them and (also) disgrace in the life of this world. And thus do We reward those who invent lies
And those who do evil works then repent after that and believe, your Fosterer, after that, is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And when the anger of Musa calmed down, he took up the tablets, and in its inscription there was guidance and mercy for those who were afraid of their Fosterer
And Musa chose seventy men from his people for Our appointed time/place, then when the earthquake took hold of them, he said, "My Fosterer ! if You had willed You could have destroyed them before along with me. Will You destroy us for what the fools among us did? This is nothing but Your testing (us), through it You lead astray whom You will and You guide whom You will, You are our Guardian, therefore protectively forgive us and have mercy on us and You are the Best of those who protectively forgive
And prescribe for us good in this world and in the hereafter, we certainly turn to You." He said, "I afflict with My punishment whom I will, whereas My mercy extends over everything, so I will prescribe it for those who guard (against evil) and give charity (zakat) and those who believe in Our signs
Those who follow the messenger, the unlettered prophet about whom they find recorded in the Torah and the Injeel (which are) with them, (that) he will enjoin upon them that which is recognised (as good) and forbid them from that which is not recognised (as good) and make lawful for them the good things and make unlawful on them the bad things and remove from them their burden and the chains which were upon their (necks), then those who believe in him and honour him and help him and follow the light that is sent down with him, those are the successful persons
Say (Muhammed), "O mankind ! I am certainly a messenger of Allah to you all, Whose is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, there is no god but He, He brings to life and causes to die." So believe in Allah and His messenger, the unlettered prophet who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him so that you may be guided
And among the people of Musa there is a community which guides with truth and thereby they do justice
And We divided them into twelve tribal communities. And We communicated to Musa, when his people asked him for water, to strike the rock with his staff; thus twelve springs gushed out from it, (and) all people came to know their drinking place. And We made the clouds to give shade over them and sent down on them manna and quails (saying), "Eat of the good things which We have provided for you." And they did not do injustice to Us but they were unjust to their own souls
And when it was said to them, "Dwell in the city and eat from wherever you will, and say: put down from us our heavy burdens, and enter the gate prostrating, We will protectively forgive you your mistakes, We will give more to the doers of good
then those who were unjust from among them changed the word to something other than that which was said to them, so We sent on them a punishment from the sky because they were unjust
And ask them about the city which was facing the sea, when they transgressed in (the matter of) Sabbath, when the fish came to them visibly on the day of the Sabbath and the day they did not keep the Sabbath, it (fish) did not come to them. Thus did We test them because they transgressed
And when a community from among them said, "Why do you admonish a people whom Allah would destroy or whom He would punish with a severe punishment?" They said, "(We admonish them so that) we may be free from blame (when we go back) to your Fosterer, (that we did our duty), and that they may guard (against evil)
So when they forgot that with which they were reminded, We delivered those who forbade evil, and caught in an evil punishment, those who were unjust because they transgressed
So when they revolted against that which they were forbidden, We said to them, "Be apes, despised
And (remember) when your Fosterer announced that towards the day of resurrection He will definitely raise against them one who would inflict them with an evil punishment, your Fosterer is certainly Quick in requiting and He is (also) Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And We divided them in the earth (into) communities, of them (some) are righteous and of them (some) are other than that. And We tested them with good and evil that they may return (to the right path)
Then successors who succeeded after them inherited the book, they accepted the apparent good of this low (life) and said, "We will be forgiven." And if a similar apparent good (again) comes to them they would accept it. Was not a pledge taken from them (through) the book, that they should not say anything about Allah except the truth? And they read that which is in the (book). And the home of the hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil). Will you not then understand
And those who hold fast by the book and establish worship (salat), We will certainly not waste the reward of the righteous
And when We shook the mountain above them as if it were a covering and they thought that it would certainly fall on them, "Take hold with strength that which We have given you and remember that which is in it that you may guard (against evil)
And when your Fosterer took out their descendants from the backs of the children of Adam* and made them bear witness against themselves (saying), "Am I not your Fosterer?" They said, "Why not, we bear witness." (We took this testimony from you) lest you should say on the day of resurrection, "We were unaware of this." * Were they in the form of some specific genes of faith
Or you should say, "Our forefathers associated partners (with Allah) before (us) and we were only their descendants (following their traditions) after them, will You destroy us for what the followers of falsehood did
And thus do We explain the signs so that they may return
Read to them the news of him whom We gave Our signs but he slipped off from it, so the devil followed him up and he became of those who are led astray
And had We willed We could have elevated him through it, but he clung to the earth and followed his desire, so his likeness is the likeness of the dog, if you attack it, breathes heavily with its tongue out. Such is the likeness of the people who deny Our signs, so narrate the narration that they may reflect
Evil is the likeness of the people who denied Our signs and were (thus) unjust to themselves
Whom Allah guides, then he it is who is guided, and whom He leaves astray, those are the persons at loss
And We have made for the hell many of the jinn and mankind, they have hearts with which they do not understand, and they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear, they are like cattle, no, they are more astray, those are the heedless persons
And Allah's are the best names, so pray to Him thereby and leave alone those who are perverted regarding His names, they will be rewarded for what they did
And among those whom We created, there is a community which guides (in accordance) with the truth and does justice thereby
And those who deny Our signs, We will catch them gradually, from where, they will not know
and I give them time, My plan is certainly strong
Have they not reflected? Their companion is not under the influence of a jinn, he is but a clear warner
Have they not looked into the kingdom of the skies and the earth and everything which Allah has created and (come to the conclusion) that it may be that (the end of ) their term has come near, then in which statement after this will they believe
One whom Allah leaves in error, then there is no guide for him and He leaves them blindly wandering on in their rebellion
They ask you about the hour (of doom), when will it be anchored? * Say, "The knowledge of it is only with my Fosterer, it will not be unveiled at its appointed time by anyone except Him. It will be heavy (probably having high gravity) in the skies and the earth, it will not come on you but of a sudden." They ask you as If you were in search of its knowledge. Say, "The knowledge of it is with Allah only but the majority of mankind does not know." * Befall
Say, "I have no power to benefit or harm myself, (I have nothing) except that which Allah wills; and had I known the un seen I would have had abundance of good and evil would not have (even) touched me. I am but a warner and a conveyer of good news to people who believe
He it is Who created you from a single soul and made from it, its mate, to dwell with her. So when he covers her she bears a light burden and moves about with it, then when it becomes heavy they both pray to Allah their Fosterer, "If You give us a good (child) we will definitely be of those who are grateful
But when He gives them a good (child) they associate with Him partners in that which He gave them, but Allah is high above that which they associate (with Him)
Do they associate (such) partners (with Allah) who do not create anything while they themselves are created
And they have no power to help them nor can they help themselves
And if you invite them towards guidance, they do not follow you, it is the same to you whether you invite them or you be silent
Those whom you pray to, besides Allah, are certainly servants like you, so pray to them then let them respond to you if you are truthful
Have they feet with which they walk, or have they hands with which they hold or have they eyes with which they see or have they ears with which they hear? Say, "Call upon (those whom you consider as Allah's) partners then plan and give me no time to wait
My Guardian is certainly Allah, Who has sent down the book and He befriends the righteous
And those, whom you pray to, besides Him, have no power to help you nor can they help themselves
And if you invite them towards guidance they do not hear and you see them looking towards you but they do not see
Take to pardon and enjoin that which is recognised (as good) and turn away from the ignorant
And if the devil instigates you with an instigation then seek the protection of Allah, He is certainly Hearing, Knowing
When those who guard (against evil), are touched by circulating evil thoughts from the devil, they remember (Allah), then they certainly see (aright)
And their brothers * pull them into error (and) then they do not cease. * Probably the devils associated with human beings
And when you do not come to them with a sign, they say, "Why have you not chosen (invented) it?" Say, "I follow only that which is communicated to me from my Fosterer. This (Quran) is (a collection of) insights from your Fosterer and a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
And when the Quran is recited listen to it and be silent that you may be dealt with mercifully
And remember your Fosterer within yourself (soul/mind) humbly and with fear, and in words not loud, in the morning and the evening and do not be of the heedless ones
Those who are near your Fosterer, certainly do not consider themselves great to serve Him and they glorify Him and prostrate before Him
They ask you about the spoils of war, say, "The spoils of war are for Allah and the messenger." So fear Allah and set right matters between yourselves and obey Allah and His messenger if you are believers
Believers are only those whose hearts (are filled with) fear when Allah is mentioned, and when His signs are read to them, it increases them (in) faith and they put their trust in their Fosterer
who establish worship (salat) and spend from that which We have provided them
those are the believers in truth, for them there are ranks with their Fosterer and protective forgiveness and an honoured provision
And a party of the believers certainly disliked the manner in which your Fosterer made you to go out of your house in the (cause of) truth
They disputed with you about the truth after it had been made clear, as if they were being driven towards death and they were seeing (it)
And (remember), when Allah promised you (to grant victory at Badr over) one of the two parties, (assuring) that it will be yours, then (at that time) you liked that the one without weapons should be yours while Allah intended to prove true the truth by His words and to cut off the root of the infidels
that He might prove true the truth and falsify the falsehood though the criminals disliked
When you sought help from your Fosterer, He responded to you (saying), "I will certainly help you with one thousand of the angels following one another
And Allah did not make it (anything) but a good news, that your hearts might be at peace through it. And there is no help except (that) from Allah, Allah is certainly Mighty, Wise
When He covered you with drowsiness (to bestow on you) peace from Him, and He sent down on you water from the sky to clean you thereby and remove from you the weakening uneasiness (caused by) the devil and to strengthen your hearts and thereby make (your) feet firm
at that time your Fosterer communicated to the angels, "I am with you, so make firm those who believe, I will cast terror into the hearts of those who do not believe, then strike above their necks and strike off every finger-tip from them
That was because they opposed Allah and His messenger, and whoever opposes Allah and His messenger, then Allah is certainly severe in requiting
That if for you, so taste it, and (know) that the punishment of the fire is for the infidels
O you who believe ! when you meet those who do not believe, marching (against you) for war, then do not turn your backs to them
and whoever turns his back on that day, unless (it be for) altering his position (as a strategy) for the war or to withdraw (to join his) group, then he indeed becomes deserving of the anger of Allah and his settling place is hell and it is an evil destination. Allah and his settling place is hell and it is an evil destination
So you did not kill them but Allah killed them, and you did not throw when you threw but Allah threw, so that He might test the believers with a good test from Him, Allah is certainly Hearing, Knowing
That is for you, and (know) that Allah is the Weakener of the plan of the infidels
If you wanted a decision then the decision has come to you, and if you desist then it will be better for you and if you return then We (too) will return, and your group will not save you from anything though it may (consist of) many (people), because Allah is with the believers
O you who believe ! obey Allah and His messenger and do not turn away from him while you are hearing (him)
And do not be like those who said, "We heard," but they do not listen
The worst of animals in the sight of Allah are certainly the deaf, the dumb who do not have sense
And had Allah known any good in them, He would have made them to hear and (even) if He had made them to hear they would have turned back and they would have been of those who keep away
O you who believe ! respond to Allah and to the messenger when he invites you to that which gives you life, and know that Allah comes between man and his heart and that, He it is towards Whom you will be gathered
And guard yourselves against an affliction which will not fall exclusively on those who are unjust among you, and know that Allah is severe in requiting
And remember when you were few and were considered weak in the land, fearing that people might kidnap you, then He gave you refuge and strengthened you with His help and provided you with good things that you may be grateful
O you who believe ! do not betray Allah and His messenger nor knowingly betray your trusts
And know that your wealth and your children are for (your) trial, and that it is Allah with Whom there is a great reward
O you who believe ! if you fear Allah He will assign to you (the power of) distinction (between right and wrong) and will wipe off from you (the ill effects of) your evils and protectively forgive you, and Allah is the Possessor of great grace
And when those who do not believe, plan against you that they might confine you or kill you or drive you away, while they plan (this) Allah too plans and Allah is the Best of planners
And when Our signs are read to them they say, "We have heard, if we will, we (too) can speak (on topic) like this, these are nothing but stories of the ancient
And (remember) when they said, "O Allah ! if this is the truth from You then rain on us stones from the sky or bring on us a painful punishment
And Allah would not punish them while you were among them and Allah would not punish them while they ask for (His) protective forgiveness
And what (reason) have they that Allah should not punish them, when they hinder (people) from (visiting) the Sacred Mosque though they are not its guardians? Its guardians are only those who guard (against evil), but the majority of them does not know
And their worship near the house (Kaaba) is nothing but whistling and clapping of hands, so taste the punishment because you did not believe
Those who do not believe, certainly spend their wealth to hinder (people) from the way of Allah, so they will (continue to) spend it, then it will become (a cause of) regret for them, then they will be overcome and those who did not believe will be gathered towards hell
that Allah may separate the bad ones from the good ones and put the bad ones one over the other, thus heaping them all together, so as to cast the [heap] into the hell, those are the persons at loss
Say to those who do not believe, if they desist then that which has passed will be protectively forgiven to them but if they repeat, then what happened to the ancient has already passed (as history and should serve as a warning)
And fight with them until there is no persecution and religion is (established) wholly for Allah, but if they desist then Allah is certainly a Seer of what they do
but if they turn back then know that Allah is certainly your Guardian, Excellent is He (as) the Guardian and Excellent is He (as) the Helper
And know that whatever you take as spoils of war, a fifth of it is for Allah and the messenger and for those who are relatives and the orphans and the poor and the wayfarer, if you believe in Allah and that which We sent down on Our servant on the day of distinction, the day the two parties met (at Badr), and Allah has power over everything
when you were on the nearer side (of the valley) and they were on the further side and the caravan was on your lower side, and if you had made a mutual appointment, you would have gone against the appointment, but (this arrangement was made) in order that Allah may accomplish an affair which was to be executed : that he who perished might perish (being involved) in a clear proof and he who survived might live (after having been involved) in a clear proof, and Allah is certainly One Who hears, knows
And (remember) when Allah showed them less in your dream, and had He showed them numerous you would have become weak hearted and you would have disputed about the affair, but Allah kept you safe, He is certainly the Knower of that which is in the hearts
and when He showed them to you less in your eyes when you met (them) and He made you to appear less in their eyes, in order that Allah may accomplish an affair which was to be executed and to Allah are (all) affairs returned
O you who believe ! when you meet a group (of enemies) then be firm and remember Allah much that you may be successful
And obey Allah and His messenger and do not dispute lest you become weak hearted and your strength departs, and be patient, Allah is certainly with those who are patient
And do not be like those who came out of their houses boastfully and to be seen by people and (who) turn away (people) from the way of Allah, and Allah is the Encompasser of what they do
And when the devil made their deeds fair seeming to them and said, "No human being can overcome you this day and I am certainly your protector." But when the two groups came in sight of each other he turned upon his heels saying, " I am free of you, I see that which you do not see, I certainly fear Allah, and Allah is severe in requiting (evil)
When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease said, "Their religion has deceived them." And whoever trusts in Allah then (he will find that) Allah is certainly Mighty, Wise
And if you could (only) see, when the angels take back (cause to die) those who do not believe, striking their faces and their backs and (saying), "Taste the punishment of burning
That is because of what your hands have sent before, and (know) that Allah is not unjust to the servants
The manner of the people of Firawn and those before them was such that they had not believed in the signs of Allah so Allah caught them for their sins, Allah is certainly Strong, Severe in requiting (evil)
That is because Allah does not change the grace with which He has favoured a people until they change that which is in their souls and because Allah is Hearing, Knowing
The manner of the people of Firawn and those before them was such that they had denied the signs of their Fosterer so We destroyed them for their sins and drowned the people of Firawn and they were all unjust
With Allah, the worst of moving creatures are certainly those who do not believe, so they will not believe (in future too)
those of them with whom, whenever you make an agreement, then every time they break their agreement, and they do not guard (against evil)
Then if you dominate them in war, disperse them (in such a manner that) those who succeed (them not being present with) them, they (too) may be mindful
And if you fear betrayal from a people then throw back to them (their agreement) on equal terms, Allah certainly does not love those who betray
And do not let those who do not believe suppose that they will win, they certainly cannot defeat (Allah)
And be prepared for (fighting with) them, with whatever force you can muster, and with companies of horses (cavalry) to frighten thereby the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them, whom you do not know (but) whom Allah knows. And anything of that which you spend in the way of Allah, will be paid back to you in full and you will not be dealt with unjustly
And if they incline to peace, then you (too) incline to it, and trust in Allah, He is certainly the Hearing, the Knowing
And if they intend to deceive you, then Allah is certainly sufficient for you. He it is Who strengthened you with His help and with the believers
and He put unity in their hearts. Had you spent all that is in the earth (even then) you would not have been able to put unity in their hearts, but Allah has put unity among them. He is certainly Mighty, Wise
O prophet ! Allah is sufficient for you and those who follow you from among the believers
O prophet ! rouse the believers to fight, if there are twenty patient ones of you, they shall overcome two hundred and if there are a hundred of you, they shall overcome a thousand of those who do not believe because they are a people who do not understand
For the present Allah has lightened for you (the responsibility) as He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred patient ones of you they shall overcome two hundred and if there are a thousand of you, they shall overcome two thousand by the order of Allah and Allah is with those who are patient
It does not befit a prophet that he should have prisoners (of war, his purpose is to fight) to the extent that he totally dominates in the land (so as to establish his religion). You intend (to have the) apparent good of the world while Allah intends (good for you in) the hereafter and Allah is Mighty, Wise
Had an ordinance from Allah not gone forth earlier, a great punishment would have befallen you due to that which you took
So eat of the lawful good things from that which you took as spoils of war and fear Allah, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
O prophet ! say to those of the prisoners (of war) in your hands (control), "If Allah knows (marks out) anything good in your hearts He will give you (something) better than that which was taken from you and He will protectively forgive you and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
But if they intend to betray you, then they had betrayed Allah earlier, so He has given (you) power over them and Allah is Knowing, Wise
Those who believed and migrated and struggled in the way of Allah with their wealth and their persons, and those who gave shelter and helped (the immigrants), those are certainly guardians of each other. And those who believed but did not migrate, it is not for you to guard them from anything till they migrate, but if they seek help from you in (the matter of) religion then it is your duty to help them except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty, and Allah is a Seer of what you do
And those who do not believe, they are guardians of each other, unless you (too) do this (that is, mutually guard and help each other) there will be persecution in the earth and great corruption
And those who believed and migrated and struggled in the way of Allah, and those who gave shelter and helped (the immigrants), those persons are the real believers, for them there is protective forgiveness and an honourable provision
And those who believed afterwards and migrated and struggled along with you, they (too) are of you, but those having relationships (of blood) are nearer to each other in the ordinance of Allah. Allah is certainly the Knower of everything
A declaration of immunity* from Allah and His messenger to those of the polytheists with whom you made an agreement. * Freedom from obligation
So move about (unrestricted) in the land for (another) four months, and know that you cannot frustrate Allah, and Allah will certainly disgrace the infidels
And an announcement from Allah and His messenger to mankind on the day of the great pilgrimage that Allah and His messenger are free from obligation to the polytheists, so if you repent it will be better for you and if you turn back then know that you cannot frustrate Allah, and convey the news of a painful punishment to those who do not believe
except those of the polytheists with whom you made an agreement then they did not go back in anything (of the agreement) nor did they help anyone against you, so fulfill for them their agreement till the completion of their term. Allah certainly loves those who guard (against evil)
Then when the sacred months pass off, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and catch them and imprison them and sit for them at every place where you can watchfully wait (for them). But if they repent and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) then leave their way free. Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And if anyone of the polytheists seeks your protection then give him protection to the extent that he hears the word of Allah, then make him reach his (place of) safety. That is because they are a people who do not know
How can there be an agreement for the polytheists with Allah and with His messenger except those with whom you made an agreement near the Sacred Mosque? So as long as they are established (on the agreement) with regard to you, you (too) be established (on the agreement) with regard to them. Allah certainly loves those who guard (against evil)
How (can there be an agreement)? If they have an upper hand on you, they neither have regard for ties of relationship nor (their) responsibility of (fulfilling) a pact. They please you with their mouths but their hearts refuse and most of them are transgressors
They have sold the signs of Allah for a small price, so they turn away (people) from His way, certainly their (deeds) ! evil is that which they do
In (the case of) a believer they neither have regard for ties of relationship nor (their) responsibility of a pact and those are the ones who exceed the limits
So if they repent and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) then they are your brothers in religion. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for a people who know
And if they break their oaths after their agreement and taunt (you) in your religion then fight the leaders of infidelity that they may desist, because there is nothing (like a binding of) oaths for them
Will you not fight a people who broke their oaths and planned to send out the messenger and they attacked you first? Do you fear them? Then Allah has more right that you should fear Him if you are believers
Fight with them, Allah will punish them through your hands and disgrace them and help you against them and heal the bosoms (hearts) of the believing people
and He will remove the anger of their hearts, and Allah turns (mercifully) to whom He wills and Allah is Knowing, Wise
Did you suppose that you will be left alone, while Allah has not yet known (marked out) those of you who struggled (in His cause), and not taken any intimate friend besides Allah and His messenger and the believers? And Allah is informed of what you do
It does not befit the polytheists that they should visit the mosques of Allah, being witnesses against themselves of (their) infidelity. Those are the persons whose deeds are fruitless and they will stay in the fire
Only he shall visit the mosques of Allah who believes in Allah and the period hereafter and establishes worship (salat) and gives charity (zakat) and does not fear anyone except Allah, then it may be that such persons will be among those who are guided
What ! do you make (one who) gives drink to pilgrims and maintains the Sacred Mosque, like one who believes in Allah and the period hereafter and struggles in the way of Allah? With Allah, they are not equal. And Allah does not guide the unjust people
Those who believed and migrated and struggled in the way of Allah with their wealth and their persons, they are greater in grade in the sight of Allah and those are the persons who achieve (the goal)
Their Fosterer conveys to them the good news of mercy from Him and (His) pleasure and gardens, wherein will be lasting happiness for them
they will stay therein for ever. Certainly there is a great reward with Allah
O you who believe ! do not take your fathers and your brothers as your friends if they love infidelity instead of belief, and whoever of you takes them as a friend then those are the unjust persons
Say, "If your fathers and your sons and your brothers and your mates and your family and friends and the wealth you have acquired and merchandise regarding which you fear that there will be no sale and the houses with which you are pleased, are dearer to you than Allah and His messenger and struggling in His way, then wait till Allah brings about His command and Allah does not guide the transgressing people
(It was) Allah (Who) had helped you in many battle fields. And on the day of (the battle of) Hunian your number which made you feel exalted, did not help you in any way and the earth, inspite of its being spacious, became constrained on you, then you turned back retreating
Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His messenger and upon the believers, and sent down forces which you did not see and (thus) punished those who did not believe, and that is the reward of the infidels
Then afterwards Allah turns (mercifully) to whom He wills and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Mercifully
O you who believe ! the polytheists are nothing but unclean, so they shall not come near the Sacred Mosque after this year of theirs, and if you fear poverty then Allah will enrich you out of His grace, if He wills, Allah is certainly Knowing, Wise
Fight with those who do not believe in Allah and in the period hereafter nor do they make unlawful that which Allah and His messenger have made unlawful nor do they adopt as their religion, the religion of truth (Islam), from among those who were given the book, till they pay by hand the jizya * and they (accept that they) are in a subdued state. * Tax taken from non-Muslims in an Islamic state for providing them full protection
And the Jews say, "Uzair is the son of Allah," and the Christians say, "The Messiah is the son of Allah." That is their saying with their mouths, they imitate the saying of those who did not believe earlier, may Allah destroy them, how they are turned away (from the truth)
They have taken their priests and monks as their fosterers besides Allah and (also) the Messiah, the son of Maryam; and they were not commanded (anything) except to serve one God. There is no god except Him, be He glorified above that which they associate as partners (with Him)
They intend to put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will not allow anything except that His light should be perfected, though the infidels dislike
He it is who sent His messenger with guidance and the true religion (Islam) that He may make it prevail over all religions though the polytheists may dislike
O you who believe ! many of the priests and the monks certainly swallow the wealth of people wrongfully and turn (them) away from the way of Allah; and those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of Allah, convey to them the news of a painful punishment
on the day it will be heated up in the fire of hell, then their foreheads and their sides and their backs will be branded with it. (It will be said to them), "This is what you hoarded for yourselves so taste (the punishment of) that which you hoarded
The number of months with Allah is certainly twelve months (in a year) in the ordinance of Allah (since) the day He created the skies and the earth, of them four are sacred (during which fighting is prohibited). That is the established law, so do not be unjust to yourselves concerning them. And fight the polytheists all together as they fight with you all together and know that Allah is certainly with those who guard (against evil)
Postponement (of a sacred month) is only an increase in infidelity through which are misled those who do not believe; they make it lawful one year and unlawful (another) year, that they may make up the number of months which Allah has made unlawful (for fighting). Thus they make lawful what Allah has made unlawful. The evil of their deeds is made fair seeming to them and Allah does not guide a people who are infidels
O you who believe ! what is (the matter) with you, that when it is said to you to go out in the way of Allah (to Tabuk) , you cling heavily to the earth. Are you more pleased with the life of this world compared to the hereafter? Then the provision of the life of this world compared to the hereafter is but little
If you do not go forth He will punish you with a painful punishment and will bring in your place a people other that you, and you cannot harm Him in anyway as Allah has power over everything
If you do not help him (Muhammed), then Allah helped him when those who did not believe sent him out (of Mecca, he being the) second of the two when they were both in the cave , when he said to his companion (Abu Bakar), "Do not grieve, Allah is certainly with us." So Allah sent down His tranquility over him and strengthened him with forces which you did not see, and made lowest the word of those who did not believe; and the word of Allah, that is the highest; and Allah is Mighty, Wise
Go forth, lightly (armed) and heavily (armed) and struggle with your wealth and your persons in the way of Allah. That is the best for you if you know
Had the gain been near and the journey easy, they would have followed you, but the distant journey was tiresome for them. And they will swear by Allah, "Had we been able to, we would have certainly gone forth with you." They destroy themselves and Allah knows that they are liars
Allah pardon you ! why did you give them permission, until those who spoke the truth were manifest to you and you had (also) known the liars
Those who believe in Allah and the period hereafter, they do not ask you for exemption from struggling with their wealth and their persons (in the cause of Allah) and Allah is the Knower of those who guard (against evil)
Only those ask for exemption (from fighting) who do not believe in Allah and the period hereafter and their hearts are in doubt, so they waver in their doubt
And had they intended to go forth (for fighting) they would have made some preparation for it. But Allah did not like their going forth, so He held them back and it was said (to them), "Sit with those who sit
Had they gone forth with you they would not have increased for you anything but loss, and would have hurried to and fro among you seeking your affliction, and among you there are some who would have listened to them, and Allah is the Knower of those who are unjust
They had sought your affliction earlier (too), and they had upset matters for you till the truth came and Allah's command prevailed, though they disliked
And among them is he who says, "Permit me (to be away from fighting) and do not put me into affliction." Have they not fallen into the affliction? And hell certainly encompasses the infidels
If good befalls you it grieves them and if any disaster befalls you, they say, "We had taken (precaution in ) our affair before hand." And they turn away and rejoice
Say, "Nothing can ever befall us except that which Allah has decreed for us, He is our Guardian. And in Allah let the believers put their trust
Say, "Do you await for us, for anything other than one of the two good things (victory or martyrdom)? And we await for you that Allah should afflict you with punishment from Him or through our hands, so wait, we (too) are waiting with you
Say, "Spend willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you, for you are certainly a transgressing people
And nothing prevents their spendings being accepted from them except that they do not believe in Allah and in His messenger, and they come for worship (salat) while they are sluggish and they spend while they are unwilling
So do not let their wealth and their children make you wonder, Allah wills only to punish them through it in this world's life and (that) their souls should depart while they are infidels. ls should depart while they are infidels
And they swear by Allah that they are with you while they are not with you, but they are people who are afraid
if they could find a refuge or caves or a place to enter (and hide) they would have turned towards it running in haste
And among them is he who blames you regarding the (distribution of) alms, so if they are given from it they are pleased and if they are not given from it then they are displeased
And had they been pleased with that which Allah and His messenger gave them and said, "Allah is sufficient for us, Allah will give us out of His grace and His messenger (too), to Allah do we (turn as) seekers (of His grace)," (it would have been better for them)
Alms are only for the poor and the needy and for those (officials who are) appointed for administering them and those whose hearts are to be reconciled and to free the captives and those in debt and (for spending) in the way of Allah and for the wayfarer, a duty imposed by Allah. And Allah is Knowing, Wise
And among them are those who annoy the prophet and they say, "He is a hearer." Say, "A hearer of good for you, he believes in Allah and believes in (what) the believers (say) and (he is) a mercy for those among you who believe." And those who annoy the messenger of Allah, for them there is a painful punishment
They swear to you by Allah (just) to please you, but Allah, with His messenger, has a greater right that they should please Him if they are believers
Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His messenger, then for him there is the fire of hell, he will stay in it? That is a great disgrace
The hypocrites are afraid lest a chapter (of the Quran) be sent down about them informing them of that which is in their hearts. Say, "Mock ! Allah will certainly bring out that which you are afraid of
And if you ask them they will definitely say, "We were only talking idly and sporting." Say, "Was it at Allah and His signs and His messenger that you were mocking
Do not make any excuse, you did reject after your belief. If We pardon a group from among you We will punish (the other) group because they were criminals
The hypocrite men and the hypocrite women, they resemble each other. They enjoin that which is not recognised (as good) and stop (people) from recognised good and withhold their hands. They have forgotten Allah so (Allah too) has forgotten them. The hypocrites, they certainly are the transgressors
Allah has promised the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women and the infidels, fire of hell, they will stay therein, that is sufficient for them and Allah has cursed them and for them there is an eternal punishment
Like those before you, they were mightier than you in strength and had more wealth and children. So they enjoyed their portion and you have enjoyed your portion like those who enjoyed their portion before you, and you indulged in idle talk as they indulged in idle talk. Those are the persons whose works have become fruitless in this world and in the hereafter and those are the persons who are at loss
Has not the news of those before them come to them: the people of Nuh and Aad and Samood and the people of Ibrahim and the dwellers of Midian and the overthrown cities. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, so it was not Allah Who was unjust to them but they were unjust to themselves
And the believing men and the believing women are guardians of each other. They enjoin that which is recognised (as good) and stop (people) from that which is not recognised (as good) and they establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and obey Allah and His messenger. Allah will be merciful to those persons, Allah is certainly Mighty, Wise. they establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and obey Allah and His messenger. Allah will be merciful to those persons, Allah is certainly Mighty, Wise
Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women, gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein and (in) good houses in gardens of everlasting bliss, and the greatest (of all will be) pleasure from Allah, that is a great achievement
O prophet ! strive against the infidels and the hypocrites and be firm against them, and their settling place is hell and it is an evil destination
They swear by Allah that they did not say (anything) and they did speak the word of infidelity, and they became infidels after their having accepted Islam, and they planned that which they could not attain, and they do not (take) revenge except (for the reason) that Allah and His messenger enriched them out of His grace, so if they repent it will be better for them and if they turn back, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter, and they will neither have a guardian nor a helper for them in the (whole of the ) earth
And of them are those who made an agreement with Allah (saying), "If He gives us out of His grace we will definitely give alms and we will definitely be of those who are righteous
But when He gave them out of His grace they hoarded it (being niggardly) and turned back and they withdrew (from the agreement)
Therefore, their consequence was, that He put hypocrisy in their hearts till the day they meet Him, because of their going against Allah in that which they had promised Him and because they lied
Do they not know that Allah knows what they hide and their secret talks and (that) Allah is the Knower of the unseen
Those who taunt such of the believers who give alms willingly and such who do not find (anything to give as alms) except (the fruit of) their striving, and consider the (believers) low among them, Allah will make them low among (the believers) and for them there is a painful punishment
Whether you seek protective forgiveness for them or do not seek protective forgiveness for them, even if you seek protective forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them protectively. That is because they did not believe in Allah and His messenger and Allah does not guide the transgressing people
Those who were left behind were happy at their sitting (by staying off), after the messenger of Allah (had left), and they disliked to strive with their wealth and their persons in the way of Allah and said, "Do not go in the heat." Say, "The fire of hell is severer in heat," had they but understood
So let them laugh a little and they will weep much (as) a reward for what they used to earn
So if Allah brings you back to (any) group from among them and if they ask you for permission to go forth, then say, "You will not go forth with me for ever nor will you fight the enemy along with me, you were pleased with sitting (and staying off from fighting) the first time, so sit with those who remain behind
And do not ever pray for anyone of them who dies nor stand by his grave. They had not believed in Allah and His messenger and had died while they were transgressors
And do not let their wealth and their children make you wonder, Allah intends only to punish them with it in this world and that their souls should depart while they are Infidels
And when a chapter (of the Quran) is sent down (ordering) that you believe in Allah and strive along with His messenger, those among them who are well-off, ask for your permission saying, "Leave us, so that we may remain with those who sit
They are pleased that they will be with those who are left behind and there is a seal on their hearts, therefore they do not understand
But the messenger and those who believe with him, they strive with their wealth and their persons, and those are the persons for whom there are good things and those are the persons who are successful
Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein, that is a great achievement
And those among the desert Arabs who came with an excuse in order that permission might be granted to them and those who lied to Allah and His messenger, sat (at home), a painful punishment will afflict those among them who did not believe
There is no blame on the weak nor on the sick nor on those who do not find that which they are required to spend, when they are sincere to Allah and His messenger. There is no way (to blame) the doers of good and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
nor (is there any blame) on those, (to whom), when they came to you that you might (arrange) to carry them, you said, "I do not find that on which I could (arrange to) carry you." They went back with their eyes overflowing with tears due to grief that they did not find that which they were to spend
The way (to blame) is only against those who ask for permission though they are rich. They are pleased that they will be with those who remain behind and Allah has set a seal on their hearts so they do not know
They will present their excuse to you when you return to them, say, "Present no excuse, we will not believe you, Allah has given us your news (by) informing us. And Allah and His messenger will see your work, then you will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen then you will be informed by Him of that which you used to do
They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them that you may keep away from them, so keep away from them, for they are unclean and their settling place is hell, a reward for that which they used to earn
They will swear to you that you may be pleased with them, but (even) if you are pleased with them, Allah is certainly not pleased with the transgressing people
The desert Arabs are stronger in infidelity and hypocrisy and more fitted for not knowing the limits which Allah has sent down to His messenger, and Allah is Knowing, Wise
And of the desert Arabs are those who take that which they spend, as a fine, and wait for some evil turns of fortune to (fall on) you. May the evil turn of fortune be on them and Allah is Hearing, Knowing
And of the desert Arabs is he who believes in Allah and the period hereafter and takes that which he spends as a means of nearness to Allah and for obtaining the prayers of the messenger. Beware ! that is certainly a means of nearness for them, Allah will make them enter into His mercy. Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And the foremost of the first of the immigrants (from Mecca) and the helpers (residing at Madina who gave shelter to the Muslim immigrants from Mecca) and those who followed them in (doing) good, Allah was pleased with them and they were pleased with Him. And He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein forever, that is a great achievement
And from among those around you of the desert Arabs, there are hypocrites and from among the people of Madina (also, there are those who) persist in hypocrisy, you do not know them, We know them. We will punish them twice, then they will be turned back to a great punishment
And (there are) others who have acknowledged their sins, they have mixed a righteous deed with another which was bad. It may be that Allah will turn to them (mercifully), Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Take alms from their wealth, through which you may clean them and purify them and pray for them, your prayer will certainly be (a source of) security for them and Allah is Hearing, Knowing
Do they not know that Allah accepts repentance from His servants and accepts alms and that Allah is the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful
And say, "Act ! so Allah will see your action and His messenger and the believers (too), and you will be brought back to the Knower of the unseen and the seen, then you will be informed by Him of what you used to do
And (there are) others who are made to wait for the command of Allah, whether He punishes them or turns to them (mercifully); and Allah is Knowing, Wise
And there are those who chose the mosque to cause harm and for infidelity and to cause disunity among the believers and as a place where one who warred against Allah and His messenger earlier, could watchfully wait; and they will definitely swear, "We intend nothing but good," but Allah bears witness that they are liars
Never stand in it. A mosque founded for guarding (against evil) from the very first day, is more deserving that you should stand in it. In it are men who love that they should be cleaned, and Allah loves those who are clean
Then, is he who founded his building for guarding (himself) from (the punishment of) Allah and (for winning) His pleasure better or he who founded his building on the edge of a cracking hollowed bank, so that it crumbles down with him into the fire of hell? And Allah does not guide the unjust people
The building which they have built will never cease to be a (source of) restlessness in their hearts unless their hearts get cut into pieces, and Allah is Knowing, Wise
Allah has certainly purchased from the believers, their lives and their wealth (and in return) for that there is the garden for them, they fight in the way of Allah so that they kill and are killed. A promise made by Him in truth through the Torah and the Injeel and the Quran. And who (can) fulfill his agreement better than Allah? So rejoice in your trade which you have traded (with Allah) and that is a great achievement
Those who repent, who serve (Him), who praise (Him), who fast, who bow down, who prostrate themselves, who enjoin that which is recognised (as good) and stop (people) from that which is not recognised (as good) and those who protect (themselves by remaining within) the limits (imposed by ) Allah; so convey the good news to the believers (described above)
It is not (fit) for the prophet and those who believe that they should ask for the protective forgiveness for the polytheists even though they be relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are inhabitants of hell
And Ibrahim's asking for protective forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise which he had promised to him. But when it became clear to him that his (father) was an enemy of Allah, he declared himself free from him. Ibrahim was certainly soft hearted, clement (kind)
And it is not (the practice) of Allah to mislead a people after He has guided them to the extent of His making clear to them that which they should guard (against). Allah is certainly the Knower of everything
The kingdom of the skies and the earth is certainly Allah's. He brings to life and causes to die, and besides Allah there is neither a guardian nor a helper for you
Allah has turned (mercifully) to the prophet and the immigrants (from Mecca) and the helpers (of these immigrants at Madina) who followed him during the period of hardship, after the hearts of a party from among them had almost deviated, then He turned to them (mercifully), to them He is certainly full of pity, Merciful
and to the three who were left behind (from going to the battle and whose condition became bad) to the extent that the earth, inspite of its spaciousness, became constrained on them and their souls (too) became constrained on them and they thought that there is no refuge from Allah except (in going) to Him. Then He turned to them (mercifully) that they may repent, Allah is certainly the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful
O you who believe ! fear Allah and be with those who are truthful
It did not befit the people of Madina and those around them of the desert Arabs to stay behind (refusing to go with) the messenger of Allah nor to prefer their own lives to his life. That is because there does not afflict them thirst or fatigue or hunger in the way of Allah nor do they tread a path which angers the infidels nor do they receive from their enemy whatever they receive, but a righteous deed is recorded for them thereof. Allah certainly does not waste the reward of the doers of good
nor do they spend any spending, small or great nor do they cut across a valley, but it is recorded for them that Allah may reward them with (something) better than that which they used to do
And it is not (proper) for the believers that they should go out all together (to fight), so why not a group go out from every party among them, so that (those who remain behind) could develop sound understanding in religion and (through this religious knowledge) warn their people when they return to them (from war) so that they (too) could be cautious
O you who believe ! fight those of the infidels who are near you and let them find firmness in you. And know that Allah is certainly with those who guard (against evil)
And whenever a chapter (of the Quran) is sent down, then from among them is he who says, "Which of you has this (chapter of the Quran) increased in belief? "So, as for those who believe, it has (further) increased them in belief and they rejoice
And as for those in whose hearts is a disease, it has (only) added uncleanliness to their uncleanliness and they die while they are infidels
Do they not see that they are afflicted once or twice every year, even then, they neither repent nor are they mindful
And whenever a chapter (of the Quran) is sent down, some of them look at others, (as if saying), "Does anyone see you?" Then they turn away. Allah has turned away their hearts because they are a people who do not understand
There has come to you a messenger from among yourselves, grievous to him is your distress, (he is) excessively desirous for your (good) and full of pity and merciful to the believers
So if they turn back, then say, "Allah is sufficient for me, there is no god but He, in Him have I put my trust and He is the Lord of the great throne (of the universe)
Alif Laam Raa. There are the signs of the book of wisdom
Is it a wonder for mankind that We have communicated to a man from among them, that he should warn mankind and convey good news to those who believe, that for them is the true footing with their Fosterer? The infidels say, “This is certainly a clear magician.”
Your Fosterer is certainly Allah Who created the skies and the earth in six periods, then He set the balance on the throne (of the universe), directing the affair. No mediator (can recommend) without (obtaining) His permission. That is Allah your Fosterer, so serve Him. Will you not then mind? without (obtaining) His permission. That is Allah your Fosterer, so serve Him. Will you not then mind
To Him will be the return of all of you, the promise of Allah is true. He it is Who begins the creation, then gets it reproduced that He may reward with justice those who believe and do righteous works. And for those who do not believe, there will be a drink of hot water and a painful punishment, because they did not believe
He it is Who has made the sun self luminous and the moon radiant (reflecting the sun light) and programmed for it stages that you may know the number of years and (keep) the account. Allah did not create that but in reality. He explains the signs in detail for a people who have knowledge
In the alternation of the night and the day and (in) that which Allah has created in the skies and the earth, there are certainly signs for a people who guard (against evil)
Those who do not hope to meet Us and are pleased with the life of this world and are satisfied with it and those who are heedless of Our signs
for such, their settling place is certainly the fire because of that which they used to earn
Those who believe and do righteous works, their Fosterer will certainly guide them through their belief, (to) rivers flowing beneath them in gardens of bliss
Their call therein will be, “You are glorified (above all) O Allah,” and their greeting therein will be “Peace,” and another call of theirs will be that, “Praise is due only for Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds.”
And if Allah were to hasten for mankind the evil, as they wish the hastening of good on them, then their term would have been brought to an end for them; so We leave those who do not hope to meet Us, blindly wandering on in their rebellion
And when harm afflicts man he prays to Us, lying on his side or sitting or standing but when We remove from him that which harmed him, he passes on as if he had not prayed to Us for the harm that had afflicted him. Thus, that which they do is made fair seeming to the extravagant
And We indeed destroyed generations before you when they were unjust, and their messengers had come to them with clear proofs but they did not believe. Thus do We reward the criminal people
Then We made you the successors in the earth after them, to see how you act
And when Our clear communications are read to them, those who do not hope to meet Us say, “Bring a Quran other than this or change it.” Say, “It is not for me to change it of my own accord, I follow nothing except that which is communicated to me, I certainly fear the punishment of the great day, if I disobey my Fosterer.”
Say, “Had Allah willed, I would not have read the (Quran) to you, and He would not have made you understand it, I have indeed lived a life time among you before it (was revealed to me). Do you not then understand?”
Who then, is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or denies His signs? The criminals will certainly not be successful
And they serve besides Allah that which neither harms them nor profits them and say, “These are our mediators with Allah.” Say, “Do you inform Allah of that which is in the skies and in the earth (which you presume that) He does not know?” Glory be to Him and Highly Exalted be He above all that they associate (with Him) as partners
And mankind were but a single community, then they disagreed. And had a word not gone forth from your Fosterer, the matter in which they had disagreed among themselves would have been settled (once for all). for all
And they say, “Why has not a sign been sent down on him from his Fosterer?” So tell (them), “(I do not know) the unrevealed (affairs, it) is only for Allah (to decide), so wait, I (too), with you, will be of those who wait.”
And when We make mankind to taste mercy after the harm that had afflicted them, then they devise a plan against Our signs. Say, “Allah is Fastest at planning, Our messengers certainly record that which you all plan.”
He it is Who makes you travel in the land and the sea, till when you are in the ships, and they sail with them due to a pleasant breeze and they are happy with it, a violent wind comes to it and (with it) a wave comes to them from all sides and they think that they are encompassed therein, (then) they pray to Allah making religion exclusively for Him, “If You deliver us from this then we will definitely be of those who are grateful.”
But when He delivers them (from the storm), they rebel in the earth without having the right to do so. O mankind ! your rebellion is only against yourselves, a provision of the life of this world, then to Us will be your return, then We will inform you of that which you used to do
The likeness of the life of this world is only like water which We send down from the sky, then with the (water) mixes up the vegetation of the earth, from which mankind and cattle eat, to the extent that the earth takes up its decoration and is adorned (with luxuriant vegetation); and (when) its owners think that they are all powerful over (getting full benefit out of) it, Our command comes (down on it) by night or by day and We make it a reaped (field of vegetation) as if it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do We explain the signs in detail for a people who reflect
And Allah invites you to the home of peace and guides whom He wills to the straight path
For those who do good is a good (reward) and more, neither darkness nor disgrace will cover their faces, those are the inhabitants of the garden, they will stay therein
And those who earn evils, (their) reward (will be) similar to their evil and disgrace will cover them, there will be no protector for them (to protect them) from Allah, their faces will be as if they were covered with pieces of dark night, those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay therein
And on the day when We will gather them all together, then say to those who associated partners (with Us), “(Stay in) your places ! you and your partners.” Then We will separate them one from the other and their (presumed) partners will say, “It was not us that you served (worshipped)
so Allah is sufficient as a witness between us and you that we were unaware of your serving (worshipping) us.”
There every soul will examine that which it had sent before, and they will be returned to Allah their Real Guardian, and that which they used to falsely fabricate will go away from them
Say, “Who provides you from the skies and the earth or who is it that has power over the hearing and the sight and who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and who governs the affair (of the universe)?” They will immediately say, “Allah,” then say, “Will you not then guard?”
So, that is Allah your Real Fosterer. Then what is left after truth except error? How then are you turned away (from the truth)
Thus the word of your Fosterer is proved true on those who exceed the limits that they will not believe
Say, “Is there anyone among your (presumed) partners (of Allah) who begins the creation then gets it reproduced?” Say, “Allah begins the creation then gets it reproduced, how then are you turned away (from the truth)?” “Allah begins the creation then gets it reproduced, how then are you turned away (from the truth)?”
Say, “Is there anyone among your (presumed) partners (of Allah) who guides to the truth?” Say, “Allah guides to the truth.” Then has He, Who guides to the truth, greater right that He should be followed, or he who does not go aright unless he (himself) is guided? Then what is the matter with you? How do you judge?”
And most of them follow nothing but conjecture (and) conjecture is certainly of no use in anything compared to the truth, and Allah is certainly the Knower of that which they do
And this Quran is not such that it could be invented by someone besides Allah, but it confirms that which is before it and it is a detailed explanation of the book (prescribed law) from the Fosterer of the worlds, in which there is nothing doubtful
Or do they say, “He has invented it.” Say, “(If any human being can invent it) then bring one chapter like it and call whomever you can besides Allah, if you are truthful.”
No ! they deny it because of that (part of it) which they cannot grasp through their (existing) knowledge and (because) its interpretation has not yet come to them. Thus did those before them deny, then see how the end of the unjust was (brought about)
And of them is he who believes in it, and of them is he who does not believe in it and your Fosterer has the best knowledge of those who are corrupt
And if they deny you then say, “For me my deeds and for you your deeds; you are free from that which I do and I am free from that which you do.”
And of them are those who (pretend to) hear you. But can you make the deaf to hear when they are not (in a position to) understand
And of them are those who look at you. But can you show the way to the blind when they are not (in a position to) see
Allah is certainly not unjust to human beings in anything but human beings are unjust to themselves
And the day on which He will gather them, it will be as if they did not stay (in the earth) except for a part of a day, they will recognise each other. Those who denied the meeting with Allah and were not guided, will be at a loss
And whether We show you a part of that which We promise them or take you back (i.e. cause you to die before that), ultimately their return is to Us; then (even after you) Allah will be a Witness over that which they do
And for every community there was a messenger, so when their messenger came to them (their affair was) decided between them with justice and they were not dealt with unjustly
And they say, “When will this promise be fulfilled, if you are truthful.”
Say, “I do not have power (even to) harm or benefit myself (I have nothing) except that which Allah wills For every community there is a (fixed) term, when their term comes (to an end), then they can neither postpone it for (some) time nor advance it.”
Say, “Do you see, whether His punishment comes to you by night or by day, what is there of it, which the criminals wish to hasten
Then will you believe in it (only) when it has befallen? What ! now (you believe) and (earlier, not believing in it) you had wished for its hastening.”
Then it will be said to those who were unjust, “Taste the punishment that stays. Will you be rewarded for something other than that which you used to earn?”
And they ask you to inform them, “Is that true?” Say, “Yes! and by my Fosterer, it is certainly true and you cannot defeat (the truth).”
And if every soul that was unjust had (all) that is in the earth, it would offer it as ransom, and they will hide the regrets when they see the punishment, and (the affair will be) decided between them with justice and they will not be dealt with unjustly
Beware ! certainly all that is in the skies and the earth is Allah’s. Beware ! certainly the promise of Allah is true but the majority of them does not know
He gives life and causes to die and to Him you will be returned
O mankind ! there has come to you an admonition from your Fosterer and a healing for (the diseases) which are in the hearts and a guidance and a mercy for the believers
Say, “In the grace of Allah and in His mercy, then in that, let them be happy, that is better than what they gather (hoard).”
Say, “Have you seen the provision which Allah has sent down for you? Then you make (something) of it unlawful and (something) lawful.” Say, “Has Allah permitted you (to make things lawful and unlawful) or do you forge (a lie) against Allah?”
And what do those who forge a lie against Allah guess (regarding) the day of resurrection? Allah is certainly Graceful to mankind but the majority of them is not grateful
And you are not (engaged) in any affair nor do you read about it from the Quran nor do you execute any work but We are Witnesses over you when you are engaged in it. And not (even) the weight of a particle in the earth or in the sky is hidden from your Fosterer and nothing less than that nor greater but it is (recorded) in a clear record
Beware ! certainly (for) the friends of Allah, there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve
Those who believe and guard (against evil)
for them is good news in the life of this world and in the hereafter, there is no change in the words of Allah, that is a great achievement
And do not let their speech grieve you, certainly the might is totally Allah’s, He is the Hearing, the Knowing
Beware ! whoever is in the skies and whoever is in the earth is certainly Allah’s, and what do they follow who pray to (their presumed) partners besides Allah? They follow nothing but conjecture, and they do nothing but lie
He it is Who made the night for you that you may rest therein and the day for visibility, certainly there are signs therein for a people who listen
They say, “Allah has taken a son,” far it is from His Glory, He is Independent, His is whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth, you have no authority with you for this (statement of yours). Do you say about Allah that which you do not know
Say, “Those who forge a lie against Allah will not be successful.”
(They have made such activities the source of their) provision in this world, then to Us will be their return, then We will make them taste a severe punishment because they did not believe
And read to them the news of Nuh when he said to his people, “O my people ! if my staying (with you) and my reminding through the signs of Allah is hard on you, then (as for me), I put my trust in Allah, now you make a collective decision in your affair along with your (presumed) partners (of Allah) then do not let your affair be dubious to you, then have it executed against me and give me no time. and give me no time
But if you turn back , then I have not asked you for any reward, my reward is with none but Allah and I have been commanded to be of those who submit (as Muslims).”
But they denied him so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and made them successors and drowned those who denied Our signs. See then, how the end of those who were warned was (brought about)
Then after him We raised messengers (who were sent) to their people, and they came to them with clear proofs but they were not ready to believe in that which they had denied earlier. Thus do We set a seal on the hearts of those who exceed the limits
Then after them We raised Musa and Harun (and sent them) to Firawn and the leaders of his (community) with Our signs, but they considered themselves great and they were a criminal people
So when the truth came to them from Us they said, “This is certainly clear magic.”
Musa said, “Do you speak (like this) about the truth when it has come to you? Is this magic? And magicians are not successful.”
They said, “Have both of you come to us to turn us away from that on which we found our fathers, and thereby become great in the earth? But we will not believe in you.”
And Firawn said, “Bring to me every learned magician.”
So when the magicians came, Musa said to them, “Put down that which you are to put down.”
So when they had put down (and exhibited their magic), Musa said, “What you have come with is magic, Allah will certainly falsify it, Allah certainly does not set right the work of those who are corrupt
and Allah confirms the truth by His words though the criminals may dislike.”
So none believed in Musa except the descendants of his people due to the fear of Firawn and their leaders, lest he should persecute them, and Firawn was certainly dominating in the earth and he was certainly of the extravagant
And Musa said, “O my people ! if you believe in Allah then put your trust in Him, if you are those who submit(as Muslims).”
So they said, “We put our trust in Allah; our Fosterer ! do not make us an (item of) trial for the unjust people
and deliver us through your mercy from a people who are infidels.”
And We communicated to Musa and his brother, “Settle your people in houses in Egypt and make your houses the Qibla (direction during worship) and establish worship (salat) and give good news to the believers
And Musa said, “Our Fosterer ! You have given to Firawn and the leaders of his (community) adornment and wealth in the life of this world, our Fosterer ! that they may mislead people from Your way. Our Fosterer ! destroy their wealth and harden their hearts so that they do not believe till they see the painful punishment.”
He said, “The prayer of both of you is accepted, so be established (on your religion) and do not follow the way of those who do not have knowledge.”
And We made the children of Israel to cross the sea. Then Firawn and his army followed them in rebellion and transgression till when the drowning grasped him, he said, “I believe that there is no god but He in Whom the children of Israel believe and I am of those who submit (as Muslims).” m the children of Israel believe and I am of those who submit (as Muslims).”
What ! now ! and you had disobeyed earlier and you were of those who were corrupt
So this day We will deliver you in (the form of) your bodythat you may be a sign for those who come after you, and certainly there are many of the human beings who are heedless of Our signs
And We indeed made the children of Israel settle down a real settling and We provided them with the good things, then they did not disagree till the knowledge came to them. Your Fosterer will certainly decide between them on the day of resurrection concerning that in which they used to disagree
So if you are in a doubt regarding that which We have sent down to you then ask those who read the book (which was revealed) before you. The truth has indeed come to you from your Fosterer so do not be of those who doubt
And do not be of those who deny the signs of Allah, then you (too) will be of those who are losers
Those on whom the word of your Fosterer has proved true will certainly not believe
even if every sign comes to them, till they see the painful punishment
Then why was there not a single city which believed so that their belief would have profited them, except the people of Yunus? When they believed We removed from them the punishment of disgrace from the life of this world and We gave them provision till a time
And had your Fosterer willed, those who are in the earth would have believed, all of them together. Will you then compel mankind till they become believers
And it is not (possible) for any soul to believe except by the permission of Allah and He casts uncleanliness on those who have no sense
Say, “See (all) that is there in the skies and the earth.” But signs and warnings are of no use for a people who do not believe
Then do they wait for anything other than the days similar to (the days of) those who passed away before them? Say, “Then wait, I am (also) with you from among those who wait.”
Then We save Our messengers and those who believe; like that, it is incumbent on Us to save the believers
Say, “O mankind ! if you are in doubt about my religion, then I do not serve those whom you serve besides Allah but I serve Allah who takes you back (causes you to die) and I have been commanded to be of the believers,”
and that, “Establish yourself for the upright religion (Islam) and do not be of the polytheists
And do not pray to (something) besides Allah, which neither benefits you nor harms you, for if you do so, then you will certainly be of the unjust
And if Allah afflicts you with harm, then there is none who can remove it but He, and if He intends good for you, then there is none who can keep back His grace, He grants it to whom He wills of His servants, and He is the Protectively Forgiving, the Merciful.”
Say, “O mankind ! the truth has come to you from your Fosterer, so whoever receives guidance, he receives guidance only for (the benefit of) his own soul, and whoever goes astray, then (the loss of his) going astray is only on him, and I am not a trustee over you.”
And follow that which is communicated to you and be patient till Allah judges and He is the Best of judges
Alif Laam Raa, (This is) a book, the communications of which are established (in wisdom, decisive), then explained in detail, from One Wise, Informed
that you should not serve anyone but Allah, I am a warner from Him and a conveyer of good news
and that you should ask for protective forgiveness from your Fosterer, then turn to Him (in repentance). He provides you with a good provision till an appointed term and bestows His grace on every possessor of grace. But if you turn back, then I fear for you the punishment of the great day
To Allah is your return and He has power over everything
Beware ! they cover up their bosoms doubly that they may hide from Him. Beware ! even when they cover themselves with their clothes, He knows that which they hide and that which they make public, He certainly knows the contents of their bosoms
And there is no moving creature in the earth but (the responsibility of) its provision is on Allah, and He knows its place/time of stay and its place/time of departure, everything is in a clear record
And He it is Who created the skies and the earth in six periods when His throne was on water,* that He may test you as to which of you is best in action. And if you say, “You will be raised up after death,” those who do not believe will definitely say, “This is nothing but clear magic.” * Fluid
And if We postpone the punishment from them for a measured period of time, they will definitely say, “What stops it? Beware ! the day it will come on them, nothing will turn it away from them and that which they used to mock at will surround them
And if We make man taste mercy from Us then take it off from him, he certainly becomes despairing, ungrateful
And if We make him taste happiness after the harm that afflicted him, he definitely says, “Evils have gone away from me,” and he is exultant, boastful
except those who are patient and do righteous works; those are the persons for whom there is protective forgiveness and a great reward
Then it may be that you will give up part of that which is communicated to you, and your bosom will become straitened by it, because they say, “Why has not a treasure been sent down on him or an angel come with him?” You are only a warner while Allah is the Trustee over everything
Or they say, “He has forged it.” Say, “Then bring ten chapters like it, forged (if it is humanly possible) and call upon whom you can, besides Allah, (for helping you in forging it), if you are truthful.”
But if they do not respond to you, then know that it has been sent down by the knowledge of Allah and that there is no god but He. Then will you be those who submit (as Muslims)
Whoever intends the life of this world and its adornment, We will pay them in full for their deeds in (this world) itself and they will not have anything reduced in it
Those are the persons for whom there is nothing in the hereafter except the fire, and the work which they did in the (world) will be fruitless and that which they used to do will become vain
Then will he, who is on a clear proof from his Fosterer and a witness from Him reads it to him, and before it (when) there is the book of Musa, (as) a guide and a mercy, (not believe in the Quran)? They will believe in it. And whoever does not believe in it from among the parties, then the fire is his promised place. So do not be in doubt about it, it is certainly the truth from your Fosterer but the majority of human beings does not believe
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah? Those will be presented before their Fosterer and the witnesses will say, “These are the persons who lied against their Fosterer.” Beware ! the curse of Allah is on the unjust
Those who turn away (people) from the way of Allah and seek crookedness in it and they do not believe in the hereafter
those cannot frustrate (Him) in the earth, and for them there will be no guardians besides Allah, the punishment will be doubled for them (because) they did not use their capacity of hearing and they did not see
Those are the persons who have caused loss to their souls and that which they used to forge has gone away from them
Assuredly, they will be the losers in the hereafter
Those who believe and do righteous works and humble themselves before their Fosterer, those are certainly the inhabitants of the garden, they will stay therein
The likeness of the two parties is as the blind and the deaf and the seeing and the hearing. Are they equal in likeness, will you not then mind
And We had sent Nuh to his people, (he said), “I am a clear warner for you
that you should not serve anyone except Allah, I fear for you the punishment of a painful day.”
So the leaders of those who did not believe from among his people said, “We see that you are only a man like us and we do not see anyone following you except those who are the lowest among us, immature in judgment, and we do not see in you any excellence (in anything) over us. No ! we think you are liars.”
He said, “O my people ! you see, if I am on a clear proof from my Fosterer and mercy has come to me from His presence but it has been made obscure to you, shall we compel you to accept it while you dislike it
And O my people ! I do not ask you for wealth (as a reward) for it, my reward is with none but Allah and I am not going to drive away those who believe, they will certainly meet their Fosterer, but I see that you are an ignorant people
And O my people ! who will help me against Allah if I drive them away, will you not then mind
And I do not say to you that with me are treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, and I do not say to you that I am an angel and I do not say about those whom your eyes hold in low estimation that Allah will never grant them good, Allah knows best that which is there in their souls, then I will certainly be of those who are unjust.”
They said, “O Nuh, ! you have disputed with us and disputed too much with us, so bring upon us that which you threaten us with, if you are of the truthful.”
He said. “Only Allah can bring it upon you if He wills and you will not be able to frustrate (it)
And my advice will not profit you, if I intend to advise you while Allah intends to leave you in error, He is your Fosterer and towards Him you will be returned.”
Or do they say, “He has forged it.” Say, “If I have forged it then on me is my crime and I am free from the crimes which are committed by you.”
And it was communicated to Nuh that, “None of your people will believe except those who have already believed, so do not grieve because of what they do
And build the ship before Our eyes and (according to) Our communication and do not speak to Me about those who are unjust, they will certainly be drowned.”
And he (became engaged in) building the ship. So every time the leaders of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him, he said, “If you ridicule us (now) then we (too) will certainly ridicule you as you ridicule
then you will know, who it is on whom the punishment will come which will disgrace him, and on whom will the eternal punishment be let loose.”
(This dispute continued) until when Our commandment came and the water gushed forth from the (reservoir in the) valley (and) We said, “Load in the (ship) two from every pair and your people and whoever believes, except him against whom the word has already gone forth,” and a small number believed with him
And he said, “Embark in it. In the name of Allah be its sailing and its anchoring, your Fosterer is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful.”
And it sailed with them in waves like mountains and Nuh called out to his son while he was separate (from those in the ship), “O my son ! embark with us and do not be with the infidels.”
He said, “I will betake myself to a mountain, it will protect me from the water.” He said, “This day there is no protector (for anyone) against the commandment of Allah except for him on whom He has mercy,” and a wave came in between them so he was among those who were drowned
And it was said, “O earth ! swallow your water and O sky ! withhold (the rain).” And the water was absorbed (in the earth) and the affair was decided and the (ship) rested on (the mountain) Al Judi. And it was said, “Away with the unjust people.”
And Nuh called out to his Fosterer and said, “My Fosterer ! my son is certainly from my people and your promise is certainly true and you are the Best Judge of (all) the judges.”
He said, “O Nuh ! he (your son) is certainly not from your people, his work is certainly other than righteous, so do not ask of Me that of which you have no knowledge, I admonish you lest you be of the ignorant.”
He said, “My Fosterer ! I seek Your protection lest I ask You that of which I have no knowledge, and if You do not protectively forgive me and have mercy on me I will be of the losers.”
It was said, “O Nuh ! go down (from the ship and the mountain) with peace from Us and blessings on you and on communities from him who is with you. And (there will be) communities whom We will give provision, then a painful punishment from Us will afflict them.”
That is from the news of the unseen which We communicate to you, before this you did not know it, you nor your people, so be patient, the (best) end is certainly for those who guard (against evil)
And to (the people of) Aad (We sent) their brother Hud (as a messenger), he said, “O my people ! serve Allah, there is no god for you other than Him, you are nothing but forgers
O my people ! I do not ask you for a reward for it, my reward is with none but Him Who initiated my creation. Do you not then understand
And, O my people ! ask protective forgiveness from your Fosterer, then turn to Him (in repentance), He will send (down from) the sky abundant rain on you and add strength to your strength, and do not turn back to be criminals.”
They said, “O Hud ! you have not come to us with a clear proof and we are not going to give up our gods on your word and we do not believe in you
We say nothing but that some of our gods have attacked you with evil.” He said, “I call Allah to witness and you (too) bear witness, that I am certainly free from (worshipping) that which you associate as partners (with Allah)
instead of Him. So plot against me all together, then do not wait (to execute it)
I certainly put my trust in Allah, my Fosterer and your Fosterer. There is no moving creature but He holds it by its forelock. My Fosterer is certainly on the straight path
So if you turn back, then I have conveyed to you that with which I was sent to you, and my Fosterer will make a people other than you to succeed you, and you cannot harm Him in anything; my Fosterer is certainly a Protector over everything.”
And when Our commandment came to pass, by Our mercy, We saved Hud and those who believed with him and We saved them from a hard punishment
And that was (the community of) Aad, they denied the signs of their Fosterer and disobeyed His messengers and followed the command of every compelling opponent
And a curse was made to follow them in this world and on the day of resurrection. Beware ! Aad did not believe in their Fosterer, so away with Aad the people of Hud
And to (the community of) Samood (We sent) their brother Salih, he said, “O my people ! serve Allah, there is no god for you other than Him. He produced you from the earth and made you dwell therein. So ask Him for protective forgiveness then turn to Him (in repentance), my Fosterer is certainly Near, Responsive.” you dwell therein. So ask Him for protective forgiveness then turn to Him (in repentance), my Fosterer is certainly Near, Responsive.”
They said, “O Salih ! earlier to this, you were one among us, in whom our (high) hopes were placed. Do you forbid us to worship that which our fathers worshipped? And we are certainly in doubt causing restlessness, concerning that which you invite us to.”
He said, “O my people ! do you see, if I am on a clear proof from my Fosterer and there has come to me mercy from Him, then who will help me against Allah if I disobey Him? Then you will add nothing to me except loss
And O my people ! this is the she camel of Allah, a sign for you, so leave her to pasture in the earth of Allah and do not afflict her with (any) harm (and if you do so), then a near punishment will seize you.”
But they slew her, so he said, “Enjoy yourselves in your houses for three days, that is a promise not to be belied.”
Then, when Our commandment came, by Our mercy, We saved Salih and those who believed with him, from the disgrace of that day. Certainly your Fosterer, He is the Strong, the Mighty
And the loud cry seized those who were unjust, so that the morning found them prostrate in their houses
as if they had never dwelt therein. Beware ! Samood did not believe in their Fosterer, so away with the Samood
And Our messengers came to Ibrahim with good news. They said, “Peace,” he said, “Peace,” then he did not delay in bringing a roasted calf
Then when he saw their hands not extending towards it, he considered them strange and conceived a fear due to them. They said, “Do not fear, we have been sent to the people of Lut.”
And his wife (who was) standing, laughed when We gave her the good news of (a son) Ishaq and after Ishaq (of a grandson) Yaqub
She said, “Sorrowful is my state, shall I have a child when I am an old woman and this my husband is an old man? This is certainly a wonderful thing.”
They said, “Do you wonder at the commandment of Allah? The mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you O people of the house. He is certainly Praised, Glorious.”
So when the fear went away from Ibrahim and the good news came to him, he began to plead with Us for the people of Lut
Ibrahim was certainly kind, tender-hearted, frequently turning (to Allah)
(It was said), “O Ibrahim keep away from this, the command of your Fosterer has (already) gone forth, and a punishment that cannot be turned back will certainly come upon them.”
And when Our messengers came to Lut he was grieved on account of them and straitened due to them, being unable (to protect them); and he said, “This is a distressful day,”
when his people came rushing towards him. And (he knew, that) earlier (too) they used to do evil things, (therefore) he said, “O my people ! these are my daughters, they are cleaner for you (if you marry them), so fear Allah and do not disgrace me with regard to my guests, is there not (even a single) right minded man among you?”
They said, “You already know that we do not have any real (interest) in your daughters and you certainly know that which we intend.”
He said, “I wish I had strength against you or could be take myself to a strong support.”
They (messengers) said, “O Lut ! we are messengers of your Fosterer, they cannot (even) approach towards you. So travel with your people during a part of the night, and do not let anyone of you turn back, except your wife, that which befalls them will certainly befall her. Certainly, their promised time is the morning. Is not the morn near?”
So when Our commandment came to pass, We made its high places (to become) its low places (turning them upside down, probably through an earthquake) and rained on them porous stones of baked clay (which probably erupted from an associated volcano and got deposited in the form of) layers
having been marked from your Fosterer, and the (township of Lut) is not far from the unjust (people, who did not believe in the Quran)
And to the (people of) Midian (We sent) their brother Shuaib, he said, “O my people ! serve Allah, there is no god for you other than Him. And do not measure and weigh less than what is due. I see you in prosperity and I fear for you the punishment of the encompassing day
And O my people ! give back full measure and weight, with justice and do not reduce those things that are due to people and do not cause disturbance in the earth, being corrupt
That which Allah causes to remain (with you with honesty) is better for you if you are believers; and I am not a protector over you.”
They said, “O Shuaib ! does your worshipping (Allah) enjoin on you (the condition) that we should give up (worshipping) that which our fathers worshipped or that we should not do whatever we like (to do) with our wealth? You are certainly kind, one on the right way (therefore think it over).”
He said, “O my people ! do you see? If I am on a clear proof from my Fosterer and He has promised me (with a) good provision from Himself, and that, disagreeing with you (on your wrong practices, if) I do not intend to go towards that from which I (myself) forbid you, (then am I wrong)? I do not intend anything but to reform to the extent of my capability, and (the success of) my conciliatory (effort, depends) on no one but Allah, in Him I trust and to Him I turn. wrong practices, if) I do not intend to go towards that from which I (myself) forbid you, (then am I wrong)? I do not intend anything but to reform to the extent of my capability, and (the success of) my conciliatory (effort, depends) on no one but Allah, in Him I trust and to Him I turn
And O my people ! do not let (your) opposition to me make you commit a crime so that there may befall you the like of that which befell the people of Nuh or the people of Hud or the people of Salih, and the people of Lut are not far off from you
And ask for protective forgiveness from your Fosterer then turn to Him (in repentance), my Fosterer is certainly Merciful, Loving.”
They said, “O Shuaib ! we do not understand much of that which you say and we certainly see you weak among us, and were it not for your family we would have stoned you and you are not mighty against us.”
He said, “O my people ! do you esteem my family more than Allah and you take Him (as something) cast behind your back? My Fosterer is certainly an Encompasser of all that you do
And O my people ! work according to your ability, I (too) am working. You will come to know, on whom will come the punishment which will disgrace him, and who is the one who lies? And be vigilant I too am vigilant with you.”
And when Our commandment came, by Our mercy, We saved Shuaib and those who believed with him, and the loud cry seized those who did injustice, so the morning found them prostrate in their houses
as if they did not dwell therein. So away with (the people of) Midian as were removed Samood
And We had sent Musa with Our signs and clear authority
to Firawn and the leaders of his (community), but they followed the commandment of Firawn and the commandment of Firawn was not right
He will lead his people on the day of resurrection so as to present them to the fire, and evil will be the place of presentation and those presented
And a curse was made to follow them in this (world) and on the day of resurrection. Evil will be the gift which will be gifted
That is from the news of the cities which We narrate to you, (some cities are still) standing while (others are) reaped (having been uprooted)
And We did not do injustice to them but they did injustice to themselves; and their (presumed) gods whom they prayed to, besides Allah, were of no use to them in anything when the commandment of your Fosterer came to pass, and they did not add to them anything other than ruin
And like that your Fosterer seizes when He seizes the cities while they are unjust. His seizing is certainly severely painful
In that there is certainly a sign for one who fears the punishment of the hereafter. That is the day on which mankind will be gathered and that is the day which will be witnessed
And We do not delay it but till a term computed
The day when it comes, no soul will be able to speak except by His permission. Then of them (some) will be wretched while others blessed
As for those who are wretched, they will be in the fire, therein for them there will be sighing and groaning
they will stay in it so long as the skies and the earth endure, except as your Fosterer wills. Your Fosterer is certainly the Doer of what He intends
And as for those who are blessed, they will be in the garden, they will stay in it so long as the skies and the earth endure, except as your Fosterer wills, a gift without break
So do not be in doubt concerning that which they worship. They do not worship but in the manner in which their fathers worshipped earlier. And We will certainly pay them back in full their portion without reduction
And We certainly gave the book to Musa, but disagreement arose therein, and if a (decisive) word had not gone forth from your Fosterer, the matter would have been decided between them, and about it they are certainly in a doubt causing restlessness
And your Fosterer will definitely pay back in full (the reward of) their deeds to all. He is certainly informed of that which they do
So establish yourself as you are commanded, (you) and he who turns (to Allah) with you, and do not rebel. He is certainly a Seer of what you do
And do not incline towards those who are unjust, lest the fire afflict you, and you have no guardians besides Allah, then you will not be helped
And establish worship at the two ends of the day and in the early parts of the night. Good deeds certainly remove evil deeds. That is a reminder for those who are mindful
And be patient, Allah certainly does not waste the reward of the doers of good
So among the generations before you, why, persons retaining (religious understanding) did not come (forward) to forbid (people) from being corrupt in the earth, except a small number of those whom We had saved from among them? And those who were unjust pursued that which was made for their enjoyment therein, and (thus) they became criminals. those whom We had saved from among them? And those who were unjust pursued that which was made for their enjoyment therein, and (thus) they became criminals
And your Fosterer is not (such as) to destroy the cities unjustly while their people are righteous
And had your Fosterer willed He would have made mankind a single community, and they will not cease to disagree (among themselves)
except those on whom your Fosterer has mercy and for that did He create them. And the word of your Fosterer will be fulfilled, “I will definitely fill hell with the jinn and mankind all together.”
And We narrate to you all the news from (the histories) of the messengers (just) to strengthen your heart there with, and through this there has come to you the truth and an admonition and a reminder for the believers
And say to those who do not believe, “Work according to your ability, we too are working
and wait, we too are waiting.”
And Allah’s is the unseen of the skies and the earth, and to Him is returned every affair. So serve Him, and put your trust in Him and your Fosterer is not unaware of that which you do
Alif Laam Raa. Those are the signs of the book that makes clear
We have sent it down as an Arabic Quran that you may understand
We narrate to you the best of narratives through that which We have communicated to you (in) this Quran, though before this you were of those unaware (of it)
When Yusuf said to his father, “O my father ! I saw eleven planets and the sun and the moon, I saw them bowing down to me.”
He (father) said, “O my son ! do not narrate your vision to your brother lest they plot a plot against you. The devil is certainly an open enemy to man
And thus your Fosterer will choose you and teach you the interpretation of events and make His favour complete on you and on the family of Yaqub, as He earlier completed it on your forefathers Ibrahim and Ishaq. Your Fosterer is certainly Knowing, Wise.”
In Yusuf and his brothers, there are indeed signs for those who inquire
When they said, “Yusuf and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, though we are a strong group. Our father is certainly in clear error
Kill Yusuf or cast him away in some (other) land, then the attention of your father will be exclusively for you, and after that you become righteous people.”
A speaker from among them said, “Do not kill Yusuf but put him in a deep well if you have (decided) to do (something to get rid of him, so that) some caravan may pick him up.”
They said, “O our father ! what reason have you that you do not trust us with (respect to) Yusuf, when we are his sincere well wishers
Send him with us tomorrow that he may enjoy himself and play and we will be his protectors.”
He said, “It grieves me that you should take him away and I fear that the wolf may eat him when you are heedless of him.”
They said, “(How) would the wolf eat him when we are a strong group? Then we would certainly be losers.”
So when they went away with him and collectively decided that they will put him in a deep well, then We communicated to him that you will definitely inform them of this affair of theirs while they do not perceive
And they came to their father at night fall, weeping
They said, “O our father ! we went off racing and left Yusuf with our things and the wolf ate him and you will not believe in us though we are truthful.”
And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said, “No ! your souls have induced this affair for you, so patience is good, and it is Allah Whose help is sought for against that which you describe.”
And a caravan came there, and they sent their water drawer and he let down his bucket (and) said, “O good news ! here is a youth,” and they hid him as an item of merchandise and Allah knew what they did
And they sold him for a low price, a counted number of dirhams*and they were disinterested in him (not knowing that he was a messenger of Allah). * Silver Coins
And the Egyptian who purchased him said to his wife, “Give him an honourable home, may be he will be profitable to us or we may take him (as an adopted) son.” And thus We established Yusuf in the land that We may teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah is Dominating in His affair but the majority of mankind does not know
And when he reached his maturity We gave him wisdom and knowledge and thus do We reward the doers of good
And she, in whose house he was, sought (to make) him yield to herself (for an evil act) and she closed the doors and said, “Come here.” He said, “I seek the protection of Allah, He, my Fosterer, has certainly given me a good home, certainly the unjust are not successful.”
And she longed for him and he (would have) longed for her had it not been that he saw a clear evidence of his Fosterer. Thus it was (made to happen), so that We might turn away from him the evil and the indecency, he was certainly of those who are exclusively Our servants
And they raced towards the door and she tore his shirt from behind and they found her husband near the door, she said, “What is the reward of one who intends (to do something) evil with your wife, except that he should be imprisoned or (given) a painful punishment?”
He said, “She sought (to make) me yield (for an evil act and thus attempted to cause me to slip) from myself.” And a witness from her people bore witness, “If his shirt is torn from the front then she speaks the truth and he is of the liars
and if his shirt is torn from behind then she speaks the lie and he is of the truthful.”
So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said, “It is certainly a plot of you women, your plot is certainly great
Yusuf : turn away from this and (O my wife:) ask protective forgiveness for your sin, you are certainly of those women who are at fault.”
And the women in the city said, “The Aziz’s wife seeks her slave to yield to her (for an evil act, his) love has affected her heart deeply, we certainly see her in manifest error.”
So when she heard of their plot (to defame her) she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave to everyone of them a knife and said ( to Yusuf), “Come out before them.” So when they saw him they regarded him great and (in their amazement) cut their hands and said, “Glory be to Allah above all ! this is not a human being, he is none other than an honoured angel.”
She said, “That is the person with respect to whom you blamed me and I did seek to make him yield himself to me but he abstained, and if he does not do what I command him to do, he will definitely be imprisoned and he will be of those who are degraded.”
He said, “My Fosterer ! the prison is dearer to me than that to which they invite me and if You do not turn away their plot from me, I may incline towards them and become one of the ignorant.”
So his Fosterer responded to him and turned away from him their plot, He is certainly the Hearing, the Knowing
Then it became clear to them, after having seen the signs, that they should imprison him till a time
And two young men entered the prison with him. One of them said, “I say myself pressing wine (in my dreams),” and the other said, “I saw myself carrying bread on my head from which birds ate. Inform us about its interpretation, we certainly see you to be of the doers of good.” rm us about its interpretation, we certainly see you to be of the doers of good.”
He said, “The food which you are provided with would not (even) come to you but I will inform you both about its interpretation before it(actually) come to you, that is (something) of what my Fosterer has taught me, I have forsaken the religious dictates of people who do not believe in Allah and do not believe in the hereafter
And I follow the religious dictates of my fathers, Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqub. It does not befit us that we should associate anything with Allah (as His partner), that’s by the grace of Allah on us and on human beings, but the majority of human beings is ungrateful (by not accepting this)
O my two companions of the prison ! are different masters better or Allah, the One, the Omnipotent
You do not serve besides Him but names which you have named, you and your forefathers, for which Allah has not sent down any authority, the judgment is on one’s but Allah’s. He commands that you serve no one but Him alone, that’s the established religion but the majority of human beings does not know
O my two companions of the prison ! as for one of you, he will give his master wine to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head; the affair concerning which you inquired is decided.”
And he said to him of the two regarding whom he thought that he would be safe, “Mention (about) me to your master,” but the devil made him forget mentioning (it) to his master, so he stayed in the prison for some years
And the king said, “I see seven fat cows which seven lean ones were consuming, and seven green ears of corn and (seven) others dry. O leaders ! explain to me my vision, if you can interpret dreams.”
They said, “Confused dreams and we do not have the knowledge of interpreting dreams.”
And he who was safe, of the two (prisoners with Yusuf) and who remembered after a long time, said, “I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me.” (He came to the prison and said)
“Yusuf, O truthful one ! explain to us: Seven fat cows which seven lean ones were consuming, and seven green ears of corn and (seven) others dry; so that I may return to the people (and tell them the interpretation), that they may know.”
He said, “You will sow for seven consecutive years, then leave in the ears (the grain) which you reap, except a small quantity from which you will eat
Then after that, there will be seven years of hardship, which will (make up) consume all that you kept in advance for them, except a small quantity from which you will have (something) preserved (probably for sowing in future)
Then after that there will be a year during which people will receive abundant rain and during which they will press (wine and oil).”
And the king said, “Bring him to me,” But when the messenger came to him, he said, “Return to your master then ask him what is the case of the women who had cut their hands, my Fosterer is certainly the Knower of their plot.”
He (the king) said (to the women), “What was your affair when you sought Yusuf to yield himself (to you)?” They said, “Glory be to Allah above all ! we did not know (find) any evil on his part.” The Aziz’s wife said, “Now the truth is manifest, I sought him to yield himself (to me) and he is certainly of those who are truthful.” said, “Now the truth is manifest, I sought him to yield himself (to me) and he is certainly of those who are truthful.”
(Yusuf said, “All)that (was done), because he (my master) should know that I did not betray him in secret (behind his back) and Allah certainly does not guide the betrayers (in their) plot
And I do not regard my soul free from (short comings), the soul is certainly an enjoiner of evil except that (soul on which) my Fosterer has had mercy, my Fosterer is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful.”
And the king said, “Bring him to me, I will appoint him exclusively for myself.” Then when he talked to him, he (the king) said, “This day you are certainly established (as) a trustworthy (in charge) by us.”
He (Yusuf) said, “Appoint me (as an In charge) over the warehouses of the land, I am certainly a custodian who knows.”
And thus did We establish Yusuf in the land to dwell in it wherever he willed. We send down Our mercy on whom We will and We do not waste the reward of the doers of good
and the reward of the hereafter is certainly better for those who believe and guard (against evil)
And Yusuf’s brothers came and entered in his presence, so he recognised them but they did not recognise him
And when they were provided with their provision he said, “Bring to me your brother from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure and I am one among good hosts
And if you do not bring him to me then there will be no measure (of provision) for you from me nor will you come near me.”
They said, “We will try to get him from his father, we will certainly do (it).”
And he (Yusuf) said to his servants, “Place their merchandise in their bags so that they may recognise it when they go back to their people and thereby return (to me).”
So when they returned to their father, they said, “O our father ! the measure (of provision) will be withheld from us, therefore send our brother with us so that we may get the measure (of provision) and we will certainly be his protectors.”
He said, “Shall I believe you with respect to him in a manner other than the manner in which I believed you with respect to his brother earlier? But Allah is the Best Protector and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones.”
And when they opened their belongings they found their merchandise returned to them. They said, “O our father ! what (more) do we desire? This is our merchandise returned to us, so we will get more food for our people and we will protect our brother and will have an additional measure of a camel (load), that will be an easy measure.”
He said, “I will never send him with you until you give me an undertaking in (the name) of Allah that you will bring him back to me unless you are surrounded (and thereby become helpless).”So when they gave him their undertaking, he said, “Allah is a Trustee over what we say.”
And he said, “O my sons ! (all of you) do not enter through one gate but enter through different gates, and nothing from Allah can be kept away from you by me, the decision is no one’s but Allah’s, in Him do I put my trust and therefore, let all those who trust, put their trust in Him.”
And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined them, it did not keep away from them anything (that was to happen to them) from Allah, it was nothing but an urge in the soul of Yaqub which he fulfilled, and he was certainly a possessor of knowledge because We had taught him, but the majority of human beings does not know
And when they entered (in the presence of) Yusuf, he took his brother to stay with him. He said, “I am your brother, so do not grieve because of what they did.”
So when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking cup in his brother’s bag. Then an announcer announced, “O caravan ! you are certainly thieves.”
They said, while facing them, “What is it that you miss?”
They said, “We miss the king’s drinking cup and he who brings it will have a camel load and I am responsible for it.”
They said, “By Allah, you know for certain that we have not come to cause corruption in the land and we are not thieves.”
They said, “Then what should be the penalty for it if you are liars?”
They said, “The penalty for it (is that), he in whose bag it is found, he (himself will receive) the penalty for it, thus do we penalize the unjust.”
So he began (the search) with their sacks before (searching) the sack of his brother, then he brought out the (cup) from the sack of his brother. Thus did We plot for Yusuf. It was (otherwise) not (possible) for him to retain his brother under the law of the king unless Allah willed. We raise the grades of whom We will, and above every possessor of knowledge there is (the Great) Knower
They said, “If he has stolen, then his brother too stole earlier,” but Yusuf kept it a secret in his soul and did not reveal it to them. He said, “You are in a bad position and Allah knows what you describe.”
They said, “O you who are mighty ! He has a father a very old man, so you seize one of us in his place, we see you to be of the doers of good.”
He said, “Allah protect (us) that we seize (some) one other than him with whom we found our property, in that case we will certainly be unjust.”
So when they despaired of him they went apart conferring secretly. The eldest of them said, “Do you not know that your father had taken an undertaking from you in (the name of) Allah, and earlier (too) you failed (in keeping up your undertaking) in the case of Yusuf. Therefore I will not leave this land till my father permits me or Allah decides (something) for me and He is the Best of judges
Return to your father and say: O our father ! your son committed theft and we do not bear witness except regarding that which we know and we could not be protectors of the unseen
And inquire in the city in which we were, and (also from) the caravan with which we travelled and we are certainly truthful.”
He (Yaqub) said, “No ! your souls have induced this affair for you so patience is good. May be Allah will bring them all together to me, He is certainly the Knowing, the Wise.”
And he turned away from them and said, “O my sorrow for Yusuf,” and his eyes became white due to grief but he suppressed
They said, “By Allah ! you will not cease to remember Yusuf till your health is ruined or you become one of those who perish.”
He said, “I expose my distress and grief only to Allah and I know from Allah that which you do not know
O my sons ! go and inquire about Yusuf and his brother and do not despair of the mercy of Allah, no one despairs of the mercy of Allah except the people who are infidels.”
So when they entered in his (Yusuf’s) presence, they said, “O you who are mighty ! harm has afflicted us and our people and we have brought poor merchandise, so give us full measure (of provision) and be charitable to us, Allah certainly rewards the charitable.”
He said, “Do you know what you did with Yusuf and his brother while you were ignorant.”
They said, “You ! are you indeed Yusuf ?” He said, “I am Yusuf and this is my brother, Allah has indeed been gracious to us; (for) him who guards (against evil) and is patient, Allah certainly does not waste the reward of the doers of good.”
They said, “By Allah, Allah has indeed preferred you above us and indeed we were at fault.”
He said, “Let there be no reproach on you this day. May Allah protectively forgive you and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful ones
Go with this shirt of mine and put it on the face of my father, (his power of) seeing will come (back to him) and come to me with all your people.”
And when the caravan departed, their father said, “I certainly perceive the smell of Yusuf, if you do not consider me weak in mind due to old age.”
They said, “By Allah, you are certainly in your old error.”
So when the conveyer of the good news came, he put (Yusuf’s shirt) on his face when (his power of) seeing returned. He said, “Did I not say to you that I know from Allah that which you do not know ?”
They said, “O our father ! ask for protective forgiveness for our sins on our behalf, we were certainly at fault.”
He said, “I will ask my Fosterer for protectively forgiving you, He is certainly the Protectively Forgiving, the Merciful.”
So when they entered (in the presence of) Yusuf, he took his parents to stay with him and said, “Enter Egypt in safety, if Allah wills.”
And he raised his parents on the cough and they fell bowing down to him, and he said, “O my father ! this is the interpretation of my vision (which I had seen) earlier, my Fosterer indeed made it a reality and He was indeed good to me when He took me out of the prison and brought you all from the desert after the devil had instigated (ill feelings) between me and my brothers. My Fosterer is certainly kind to whom He wills, He is certainly the Knowing, the Wise
My Fosterer ! You have given me (something) of power and taught me about interpreting the events. Initiator of the creation of the skies and the earth ! You are my Guardian in this world and the hereafter, take me back (make me die) in submission (as a Muslim) and join me with the righteous.”
That’s the news of the unseen which We communicate to you and you were not with them when they collectively decided their affair and (when) they were planning
And the majority of the human beings will not believe though you desire excessively
And you do not ask them for any reward. It is nothing but a reminder for the worlds
And how many of the signs in the skies and the earth do they pass by yet they turn away from them
And the majority of them does not believe in Allah without associating partners (with Him)
Then do they feel secure from the covering of punishment of Allah which will come on them or the hour of doom which will come suddenly while they do not perceive
Say, “This is my way, I invite towards Allah (being) on sure proof, myself and those who follow me. And Glory be to Allah and I am not of the polytheists.”
And We did not send (any messenger) before you but they were men from among the people of the cities, to whom We had communicated. Have they not traveled in the earth and seen how the end of those before them was (brought about)? And the home of the hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil). Then do you not have sense
Our help came to them at the point when the messengers were despaired, and they thought that they were denied. Then whom We willed, he was saved. And Our punishment was not turned away from the criminal people
In their narratives there is indeed a lesson for men of understanding. The (Quran) is not a fabricated statement but it is a confirmation of what is before it (of the earlier Divine books) and an explanation of everything and a guide and a mercy for a people who believe
Alif Laam Miim Raa. Those are the signs of the book. And that which is sent down to you from your Fosterer is the truth, but the majority of human beings does not believe
It is Allah Who raised the skies (heavenly bodies) without any support which you see, then set the balance on the throne (of the universe), and He compelled the sun and the moon (to follow His laws), each one moves fast till an appointed time. He governs the affair. The signs are explained in detail by Him that you may be certain of meeting your Fosterer
And He it is Who stretched the earth and made in it mountains and rivers. And of every fruit in it, He has made pairs of two. He covers the night over the day. In that there are certainly signs for a people who reflect
And in the earth there are neighboring tracts, and gardens of grapes and fields sown with corn and date palms, having one root and (others) having distinct roots, watered with one water. And We have made some to excel others in fruit. In that there are certainly signs for a people who understand
And if you would wonder, then wonderful is their saying, “What ! when we become (part of the ) soil (after our death) shall we indeed be (created ) in a new creation?” Those are the persons who do not believe in their Fosterer and those will have chains in their necks and those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay therein
And they ask you to hasten on the evil before the good, when there have been exemplary punishments before them. And your Fosterer is certainly Protectively Forgiving to mankind (inspite) of their being unjust and your Fosterer (at the same time) is certainly Severe in requiting (evil)
And those who do not believe say, “Why has not a sign been sent down to him from his Fosterer?” You are only a warner and for every people there is a guide
And Allah knows that which every female bears and that which the wombs absorb and that which they grow; and with Him, everything is according to a programme
Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Great, the Most High
He who speaks secretly from among you and he who speaks openly and he who hides himself in the night and (he who) goes forth in the day time, are all equal (to Him)
For him there are (angels) following him closely, before him and behind him, protecting him by the command of Allah. Allah certainly does not change (the condition) in which a people are, until they change that which is in their souls. And when Allah intends evil for a people then there is no turning it back, and besides Him there is no guardian for them
He it is Who shows you the lightning (causing) fear and hope and He produces the heavy clouds
And the thunder glorifies Him with His praise and the angels (too), because of His fear; and He sends the thunder-bolts, then strikes with it whom He wills, and they dispute about Allah while He is Severely Powerful
To Him is due the real prayer (for help), and those to whom they pray (for help) besides Him, do not respond to them in anything but like one who stretches his hands towards water that it may reach his mouth but it does not reach it. And the prayer of the infidels (is nothing) but in vain, (being fruitless)
And to Allah bows down whoever (and whatever) is in the skies and the earth willingly and unwillingly and their shadows (too), in the mornings and the evenings
Say, “Who is the Fosterer of the skies and the earth?” Say, “Allah.” Say, “Then do you take guardians besides Him, who do not have the power to benefit or harm (even) their own selves?” Say, “Are the blind and the seeing equal or is the darkness equal to light. Or do they assign partners for Allah who have created as He has created, so that the creation (of Allah and theirs appear) similar to them?” Say, “Allah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Omnipotent.” Allah and theirs appear) similar to them?” Say, “Allah is the Creator of everything and He is the One, the Omnipotent.”
He sends down water from the sky which flows in valleys according to its programme, so that the torrent bears (on its surface) a swelling foam, and from that which they melt in fire for making ornaments or things (of utility, rises) a foam similar to it, thus Allah strikes (a comparison between) the truth and the falsehood. So as for the foam it passes away as useless froth and as for that which is useful to mankind, it remains in the earth. Thus does Allah (explain by) striking examples
It is good for those who respond to their Fosterer, and those who do not respond to Him, (even) if they had all that is in the earth and the like thereof with it, they would offer it as ransom, for such persons there is an evil accountability and their settling place is hell and it is an evil place of habitation
Then, is he who knows, that what is sent down to you from your Fosterer is the truth, like him who is blind? Only men of understanding will mind
those who fulfill the agreement with Allah and do not break the pledge
and those who join that which Allah has commanded to be joined and fear their Fosterer and are afraid of an evil accountability
and those who are patient seeking the Attention of their Fosterer and establish worship (salat) and spend from that which We have provided them, secretly and publicly and turn off evil with good. For such persons there will be the final (good) home
gardens of ever lasting bliss which they will enter along with those who were righteous from among their parents (forefathers) and their spouses and their descendants. And the angels will enter on them from every gate (saying)
“Peace be on you because of your patience,” so (for them is) happiness of the final (good) home
And those who break the agreement of Allah after having pledged it, and cut off that which Allah has commanded that it should be joined, and cause corruption in the earth, for such persons there will be the curse and for them will be the evil home
Allah enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (it for whomever and whenever He wills). And they are happy with the life of this world and the life of this world, compared to the hereafter, is nothing but (temporary) enjoyment
And those who do not believe say, “Why is not a sign sent down on him from his Fosterer?” Say, “Allah certainly leaves in error whom He wills and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him)
those who believe and whose hearts find peace in the remembrance of Allah. Beware! hearts do find peace in the remembrance of Allah
Those who believe and do righteous works, for them is pleasing good and a beautiful place of return.”
Thus We have sent you to a community, before whom other communities have passed away, that you may read to them that which We have communicated to you, yet they do not believe in the Beneficent (Allah). Say, “He is my Fosterer, there is no god except Him, in Him do I put my trust and to Him do I turn.”
And if there were a Quran, with which mountains could be moved or with which the earth could be cleaved asunder or with which the dead could be made to speak (even then they would not have believed). No! the command is wholly Allah’s. Then, do not those who believe know, that if Allah had willed He would have guided the whole of mankind? And as for those who do not believe, disaster will not cease to afflict them because of that which they do or it will alight near their houses until the promise of Allah comes to pass, Allah certainly does not go against His promise. do or it will alight near their houses until the promise of Allah comes to pass, Allah certainly does not go against His promise
And messengers were certainly mocked at before you, but I gave (sufficient) time to those who did not believe, then I caught them. How then was my requital (of evil)
Then, is He, Who is established on every soul (so as to know) that which it earns, (like those who are powerless)? And they appoint partners for Allah. Say, “Name them. Or do you wish to inform Him about (something) which He does not know in the earth? Or (is your polytheism just an) expression of words (and nothing else)?” No! their plans are made to appear fair seeming to those who do not believe and they are turned away from the way, and whom Allah leaves in error, then for him there is no guide
For them there is punishment in the life of this world and the punishment of the hereafter is more painful, and they will have no defender against Allah
The likeness of the garden which is promised to those who guard (against evil): rivers flow beneath it, its food is everlasting and (also) its shade. That is the end of those who guard (against evil) and the end of the infidels is the fire
And those whom We gave the book are happy because of that which is sent down to you. And from among the parties, is he who does not recognise a part of it. Say, “I am commanded that I should serve only Allah and that I should not associate partners with Him. Towards Him do I invite and towards Him is my return.”
And thus have We sent it down (as) a judgment in Arabic, and if you follow their desires after the knowledge which has come to you, (then) you will not have any guardian or defender against Allah
And We had sent messengers before you, and We had given to them wives and off spring; and it was not in (the power of) a messenger to bring a sign without the permission of Allah. For every term (period) there is a prescription (book)
Allah abolishes what He wills and keeps established (what He wills) and with Him is the original prescription (book)
And whether We make you see something of that which We have promised them or We take you back (cause you to die), on you then, is (incumbent) only the conveyance (of the message) while on Us (it is to take) the account
Or do they not see that We certainly give the earth its reduction from its borders . And (when) Allah commands none can reverse His command and He is Quick at (settling) the account
And those before them did indeed plan, but the planning is wholly Allah’s (consequently) He knows what every soul earns. And the infidels will come to know, for whom is the final (good) home
And those who do not believe say, “You are not a messenger.” Say, “Allah is sufficient as a Witness between me and you along with him with whom is the knowledge of the book.”
Alif Laam Raa. A book which We have sent down to you so that, by the permission of their Fosterer, you may bring out mankind from the darkness (and lead them) towards the light, towards the path of the Mighty, the Praised
Allah is He, Whose is whatsoever is in the skies and whatsoever is in the earth; and sorrowful will be the state of the infidels due to a severe punishment
Those who love the life of this world more than the hereafter and turn away (people) from Allah’s way and seek crookedness in it, they are far astray
And We did not send any messenger (with a message) but in the language of his people that he might make (things) clear to them. Then Allah leaves in error whom He wills and guides whom He wills and He is the Mighty, the Wise
And We had sent Musa with Our signs (saying) that, “Bring out your people from the darkness towards the light and remind them of the days (favours) of Allah, certainly in that there are signs for every patient, grateful one.”
And when Musa said to his people, “Remember Allah’s favour on you when He delivered you from the people of Firawn who subjected you to severe punishment, when they killed your sons and let your women live, and in that there was a great trial from your Fosterer
And when your Fosterer announced: If you are grateful I will definitely give you more, but if you are ungrateful, My punishment is certainly severe.”
And Musa said, “If you are ungrateful, you and all in the earth together, (even) then Allah is certainly Independent, Praised.”
Has the news of those before you not come to you: people of Nuh and Aad and Samood and those after them? They do not know them but Allah (knows). Their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they thrust their hands in their mouths and said, “We certainly do not believe in that which you are sent with, and we are certainly in doubt causing restlessness, about that which you call us to.”
Their messengers said, “Is there a doubt about Allah, the Initiator of the creation of the skies and the earth? He invites you to protectively forgive you your sins and to give you time till an appointed term.” They said, “You are nothing but men like us, you intend to turn us away from that which our fathers used to serve (worship), so bring to us some clear authority.” othing but men like us, you intend to turn us away from that which our fathers used to serve (worship), so bring to us some clear authority.”
Their messengers said to them, “We are (of course) nothing but men like you but Allah bestows (his) favour on whom He wills of His servants, and it is not possible for us to come to you with an authority without the permission of Allah, and therefore, let the believers put their trust in Allah
And what (reason) have we that we should not put our trust in Allah when He has guided us to our ways? And we will definitely be patient on the harm which you do to us, and therefore, let those who trust, put their trust in Allah.”
And those who did not believe said to their messengers, “We will definitely drive you out from our land or else you should return to our religious dictates.” So their Fosterer communicated to them, “We will definitely destroy the unjust
and We will definitely make you dwell in the land after them.” That’s for him who fears standing before Me and fears My threat
And the (messengers) sought for victory, so every compelling opponent was defeated
Hell is before him and he will be made to drink from boiling water
He will drink it little by little but he will not be able to swallow it, and death will come to him from every place yet he will not die, and before him there will be a harsh punishment
The likeness of those who do not believe in their Fosterer (is like those) whose works will be like ashes on which the wind blows hard on a stormy day. They will not have power on anything of that which they earned. That (in fact), will be going far astray (from success)
Do you not see that Allah created the skies and the earth in reality? * If He wills He can remove you and bring in a new creation, * The universe is real, not an illusion
and that is not mighty for Allah
And they will all appear before Allah. Then the weak will say to those who were considered great, “We were your followers, so can you keep us safe from anything of Allah’s punishment?” They will say, “Had Allah guided us we would have guided you, (now) it is the same to us whether we are impatient or patient, there is no way of escape for us.”
And the devil will say after the affair is decided, “Allah certainly promised you the promise of truth and I promised you but went against (my promise to ) you, and I had no authority over you except that I invited you and you responded to me, so do not blame me but blame yourselves. I cannot help you (on your cries for help) nor can you help me I certainly rejected that (act of yours) in which you earlier associated me as a partner (with Allah). Those who are unjust, for them there is certainly a painful punishment.”
And those who believed and did righteous works will be made to enter the gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will stay therein by the permission of their Fosterer. Their greeting therein will be ‘Peace’
Did you not consider how Allah sets forth a similitude? A good statement is like a good tree, the root of which is firm and the branches of which are in the sky
It gives its fruit in every season by the permission of its Fosterer, and Allah sets forth similitude’s for mankind, that they may be mindful
And (another) similitude: A bad statement is like a bad tree (which can be easily) uprooted from the earth’s surface, it has no stability
Through the confirmed statement Allah establishes those who believe, (both) in the life of this world and in the hereafter, and Allah leaves the unjust in error and Allah does what He wills
Did you not see those who exhibit ingratitude in exchange for Allah’s favours and make their people alight into the home of loss
hell, they will enter it and it is an evil place (and time for) staying
And they set up equals with Allah that they may mislead (people) from His way. Say, “Enjoy yourselves, but you are certainly destined for hell.”
Say to My servants who believe, that they should establish worship (salat) and spend from that which We have provided them, secretly and publicly, before the coming of a day in which there will be neither (mutual) trade nor friendship
Allah is He Who created the skies and the earth and sent down water from the sky, then through it He brought forth (many varieties) of fruits (as) provision for you. And He compelled the ships (to follow His laws) and thereby sail in the sea by His command for your (service), and He compelled the rivers (to follow His laws) for your (service)
And He compelled the sun and the moon (to follow His laws) constantly for your (service) and compelled the night and the day (to follow His laws) for your service
And He gives you everything which you ask from Him and if you count Allah’s favours you will not be able to compute them. Man is certainly unjust, ungrateful
And when Ibrahim said, “My Fosterer ! make this city secure and save me and my sons from worshipping idols
My Fosterer ! they have misled many of the mankind, so whoever follows me is of me and whoever disobeys me, then certainly You are Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Our Fosterer ! I have settled (some) of my off-spring in a valley without cultivation, near Your Sacred House, our Fosterer ! that they may establish worship (salat), so make the hearts of mankind to incline towards them, and provide them with fruits that they may be grateful
Our Fosterer ! You certainly know that which we hide and that which we make public and nothing is hidden from Allah (whether) in the earth or in the sky
Praise is due only for Allah Who has granted me in old age, Ismael and Ishaq, my Fosterer is certainly the Hearer of prayer
My Fosterer ! make me one who establishes worship (salat) and (also) from my offspring. Our Fosterer ! and accept my prayer
Our Fosterer ! protectively forgive me and my parents and the believers on the day the account (of deeds) will be established.”
And do not think that Allah is unaware of that which the unjust do. He only gives them time till the day on which the eyes will stare (in horror)
(they will be) running with their heads raised without blinking their eyes and their hearts (will be) vacant
And warn mankind of the day when the punishment will come upon them, then those who were unjust would say, “Our Fosterer ! give us time till a near term, we will respond to your invitation and we will follow the messengers.” (They will be answered), “Did you not swear before, that there will be no decline for you
And you dwelt in the dwellings of those who were unjust to themselves and it was made clear to you how We dealt with them and We had set forth similitude’s for you.”
And they had planned their plan, and their plan is with Allah, and if their plan was implemented (it would have been sufficient) for moving away mountains thereby
So do not think that Allah will go against His promise to His messengers, Allah is certainly Mighty, Capable of retribution
The day on which the earth will be changed to other than the (present) earth and the skies (too), and they will appear before Allah, the One, the Omnipotent
And on that day you will see the criminals linked together in chains
their shirts made of pitch and the fire covering their faces
that Allah may reward every soul (according to) that which it earned. Allah is certainly Quick (at settling) the account
This is a message for mankind that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is certainly one God, and that men of understanding may be mindful
Alif Laam Raa. Those are the signs of the book and a Quran that makes things clear
Those who do not believe will often wish that they had been Muslims
Leave them eating and enjoying and let (false) hope amuse them, but they will come to know
And We did not destroy any city but at the known prescription (of the time which was destined) for it (earlier)
No community can advance (the time of) its term (for destruction) nor can it postpone (it)
And they say, “O you on whom the reminder has been sent down ! you are certainly possessed by a jinn
Why do you not come to us with the angels, if you are of the truthful ones?”
We do not send down the angels except with the truth and then they would not be given time
We have certainly sent down the reminder and We are its Custodians
And We had indeed sent (messengers) before you to the ancient sects
And there did not come to them a single messenger but they mocked at him
Thus do We make it to enter the hearts of the criminals
(So) they (too) will not believe in it, and this (has been) the procedure of the ancients (who) have passed away
And even if We had opened on them a gate of the sky so that they could keep on ascending in it
they would only say, “Our eyes are intoxicated. No ! we are people influenced by magic.”
And We have made galaxies in the sky and adorned it for those who see
And We have protected it from every driven away devil
except him who steals a hearing, so a clear flame* follows him. * Probably a meteorite
And the earth We have stretched it and We have put in it (sedimentary) mountains and caused to grow in it everything balanced (in due proportion)
And We have made for you means of livelihood therein, and for him (too) for whom you are not the providers
And there is not a single thing but with Us are treasures of it and We do not send it down but in a known measure (according to a programme)
And We send the winds fertilizing, then We send down water from the sky and We provide it to you for drinking and you are not the storers of it
And certainly, it is We Who bring to life and cause to die and We are the Inheritors
And We indeed know those of you who have (lived and) gone before (you) and We indeed know those who are (yet) to come
And your Fosterer will certainly gather them (all), He is certainly Wise, Knowing
And We had created man from mud containing black particles # (which were) processed . # Probably carbon compounds
And the jinn We had created earlier from a fiery heat wave
And when your Fosterer said to the angels, “I am creating man from mud containing black particles (which were) processed
so when I set him up in equilibrium and blow into him of My spirit, then fall bowing down to him.”
So the angels bowed down all of them together
except Iblis, he refused to be with those who bowed down
He (Allah) said, “O Iblis ! what is your reason for your not being of those who bowed down?”
He (Iblis) said, “I am not one to bow down to man whom You created from mud containing black particles (which were ) processed.”
He said, “Then get out of it, for you are certainly driven away
and there is certainly a curse on you till the day of judgment.”
He said, “My Fosterer ! so give me time till the day they are raised.”
He said, “So you are of those who are given time
till the day, the timing of which is known.”
He said, “My Fosterer ! because You have removed me from the way, I will definitely make (evil) fair seeming to them in the earth and I will definitely remove all of them from the way (leading to paradise)
except Your servants among them who exclusively (serve You).”
He said, "This (path of My servants) is the path (leading) straight to Me
You will certainly not have any authority on My servants, except him who follows you from among those who are removed from the way (leading to paradise)
and hell is certainly the promised place for all of them.”
There are seven gates for it, for each of these (gates) there will be an assigned portion
And those who guard (against evil) will certainly be in the midst of gardens with water springs
(It will be said to them), “Enter them in peace, being secure.”
And We will remove whatever of ill feeling would be there in their hearts, (they will be like) brothers, (sitting) on couches, facing each other
toil will not touch them there in nor will they be sent out from there
Inform My servants that, “I am certainly the Protectively Forgiving, the Merciful,”
and (also) that, “My punishment is certainly a painful punishment.”
And inform them about the guests of Ibrahim
when they entered in his presence and said, “Peace.” He said, “We are certainly afraid of you.”
They said, “Do not be afraid, we (have come to) give you the good news of a son possessing knowledge.”
He said, “Do you give me the good news when old age has effected me? Then what is it about which you give me good news?”
They said, “We give you the good news in truth, so do not be of those who are astray?”
He said, “ And who despairs of the mercy of his Fosterer except those who are despair.”
He said, “ Then what is your (other) business O you messengers?”
They said, “We are sent towards a criminal people
except the family of Lut, we will certainly save all of them
except his wife." We had destined that she should be of those who are to be left behind
So when the messengers came to the family of Lut
he said, "You are a people whom (we) do not recognise
They said, "No! we have come to you with that about which they used to doubt
and we have come to you with the truth and we are certainly truthful
So go away with your followers during part of the night, and (you) follow behind them and do not let anyone of you turn round, but go to the place to which you are commanded
And We decided (and revealed) that affair to him, that the roots of these (people who are to be left behind) will be cut off by the morning
And the people of the city came rejoicing
He said, "They are certainly my guests so do not defame me
and fear Allah and do not disgrace me
They said, "Did we not forbid you from (speaking on behalf of everyone in) the worlds
He said," These are my daughters (for marriage), if you are to do (anything)
By your life! they were certainly blindly wandering in their intoxication
So the loud cry seized them at morning
Thus We made their (city) turn upside down and rained on them porous stones of baked clay* . *Probably volcanic debris
In that there are certainly signs for those who understand signs
And the (city) is on the existing road
In that there are certainly signs for those who believe
And the inhabitants of the jungle were also unjust
so We inflicted retribution on them and certainly, both (the cities) are on the open road (seen) clearly
And the inhabitants of Al Hijr (The Rocky Tract) denied the messengers
And We sent to them Our signs but they turned away from them
And they used to carve out houses in the mountains (for their) security
So the loud cry seized them at morning
So that which they used to earn was of no use to them
And We did not create the skies and the earth and that which is between them both, but in reality. And the hour of doom is certainly coming, so overlook, overlooking in a good manner
Your Fosterer is certainly the Creator Who knows
And We have given you seven of the frequently repeated (verses of chapter one) and the great Quran
Do not strain your eyes (by looking) towards that which We have given for enjoyment to some groups among them, and do not grieve over them and lower your wing to the believers
And say," I am certainly a clear warner
Like that We will send down (the punishment) on the dividers
who made the Quran into parts (accepting some and rejecting other parts)
So by your Fosterer, We will definitely question all of them
regarding that which they used to do
So proclaim that which you are commanded to (proclaim) and turn away from the polytheists
We are certainly sufficient for you against those who mock (at you)
those who set up another god with Allah, they will come to know
And We indeed know that your heart is straitened due to that which they say
so glorify by praising your Fosterer and be of those who prostrate
And serve your Fosterer till that which is certain comes to you
The commandment of Allah will come to pass so do not desire to hasten it. Glory be to Him and He is high above that which they associate (with Him as partners)
He sends down the angels with the spirit by His command on whom he wills of His servants (with the message) that, “Warn that there is no god but Me, so fear Me.”
He created the skies and the earth in reality, He is high above that which they associate (with Him as partners)
He created man from a sperm, even then he is an open disputant
And He created the cattle for you, (you have) in their (skins) warm clothing and (other) uses, and (some) of them you eat
And there is a beautiful (sight) for you in them, when you bring them home (in the evening) and when you take them out (for pasture, in the morning)
And they carry your heavy (things) to a land which you could not have reached but with hardship to yourselves, your Fosterer is certainly full of pity, Merciful
And (He created) horses and mules and asses that you may ride upon them and as an ornament and He creates that which you do not know
And on Allah (rests) the direction (towards the right) way and (some) of the (ways) turn aside and had He willed He would have guided all (of you). (R)
He it is Who sends down water from the sky for you, from it you drink and through it (grow) trees on which you feed your cattle
through it He causes vegetation to grow for you and (also) the olives and the date palms and the grapes and all (kinds) of fruits. There is certainly a sign in that for a people who reflect
And He compelled the night and the day and the sun and the moon (to follow His laws) for your (service), and the stars (too) are compelled (to follow His laws) by His command. There are certainly signs in that for a people who understand
And He has produced for you in the earth (things) differing in their colours. There is certainly a sign in that for a people who are mindful
And He it is Who compelled the ocean (to follow His laws) that you may eat fresh flesh (of fish) from it and bring out form it ornaments (pearls) which you wear, and you see the ships cleaving (the water and sailing) in it, that you may seek of His grace and that you may be grateful (to Him)
And He has put in the earth mountains lest it should shake with you and (He has made) rivers and roads that you may find guidance (to their desired destination)
And (through) landmarks and through the stars they find guidance (to your desired destination)
Then, is He Who creates, like one who does not create? Will you not then be mindful
And if you count the favours of Allah you will not be able to compute them. Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And Allah knows that which you keep secret and that which you make public
And those whom they pray to, besides Allah, they do not create anything, while they are themselves created
(They are) dead, not alive and they do not perceive when they will be raised
Your God is one God, so those who do not believe in the hereafter, their hearts do not recognize( this) and they consider themselves great
Allah assuredly knows that which they keep as secret and that which they make public. He certainly does not like those who consider themselves great
And when it is said to them, “What has your Fosterer sent down?” They say, “Stories of the ancient,”
that they may bear their own burdens in full on the day of resurrection, along with the burdens of these whom they mislead without knowledge. Beware! evil is that which they will bear
Those before them had (also) planned, so Allah brought (down) their building from the (very) foundations so that the roof fell down on them from above them and the punishment came to them from directions they did not perceive
Then on the day of resurrection He will disgrace them and say, “Where are those whom you associated with Me as partners, due to whom you were in opposition?” Those who are given knowledge will say, “This day disgrace and evil are upon the infidels,”
whom the angels take back (cause to die) while they are unjust to themselves. They would then put (forward) submission (saying), “We did not do any evil.” Why not! Allah is certainly the Knower of what you used to do
so enter the gates of hell. They will stay therein. So evil is the home of those who consider themselves great
And (when) it is said to those who guard (against evil), “What has your Fosterer sent down?” They say, “Good.” For those who do good in this world is good, and the home of the hereafter will be better, and the home of those who guard (against evil) is excellent
everlasting gardens, they will enter therein, rivers flowing from beneath them, for them therein, there will be whatever they will (for).Thus does Allah reward those who guard (against evil)
those whom the angels take back(cause to die while they are good),saying, “Peace be on you, enter the garden because of that which you used to do.”
Do they wait for anything else, except that the angels should come to them or the command of your Fosterer should come to pass? Thus, those before them (also) did, and Allah was not unjust to them but they were unjust to themselves
So the evil (consequences) of what they did afflicted them and that which they used to mock at, surrounded them. vil (consequences) of what they did afflicted them and that which they used to mock at, surrounded them
And those who associate partners (with Allah) say, “Had Allah willed we would not have served (worshipped) anything besides Him, we and our fathers; and we would not have made anything unlawful, besides Him*.” Those before them (also) did like that, so what (else is incumbent) on the messengers except clear conveyance (of the message)? * In addition to His making certain things unlawful
And We had raised a messenger in every community (saying) that, “Serve Allah and keep away from false deities.” So among them were (some people) whom Allah guided and among them were (others) on whom error became due. So travel in the earth and see, how the end of those who denied was (brought about)
(Even) if you excessively desire for their guidance, (even) then Allah certainly does not guide him whom He leaves to stray and for them there are no helpers
And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths, “Allah will not raise him who dies.” Why not? It is a promise binding on Him but the majority of mankind does not know
(He will raise them) that He might make clear to them that in which they disagreed and that those who did not believe might know that they were liars
Our saying for anything when We intend it is that We say to it only, “Be,” so it is
And those who migrated in (the cause of) Allah after the injustice that was done to them, We will definitely settle them well in this world and the reward of the hereafter will be greater, if (only) they knew
those who were patient and had put their trust in their Fosterer
And We did not send before you, (messengers) other than men, to whom We had communicated. So ask the people who remember, if you do not know
(they came) with clear proofs and books. And We sent down the reminder to you, that you may make clear to mankind that which is sent down to them and that they may reflect
Then, do those who plan evil (things consider themselves) secure that Allah will (not) sink the earth with them, or that the punishment will (not) come to them from directions they do not perceive
or that He will (not) seize them in their going to and fro, when they will not be in (a position to) frustrate (Him)
or that He will (not) seize them by causing them to suffer a gradual loss? But your Fosterer is certainly full of pity, Merciful
Or did they not see towards all the things which Allah has created, (how) their shadows return from right and left bowing down to Allah while they are humbly (following His laws)
And to Allah bows down whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth of moving creatures and the angels and they do not consider themselves great
They fear their Fosterer above them and do what they are commanded
And Allah has said, “Do not take two gods, He is only One God, so fear Me alone.”
And whatever is in the skies and the earth is His and His is the law (that prevails) forever. Will you then fear (someone) other than Allah
And whatever (items of) comfort are with you they are from (no one) but Allah. Then when harm afflicts you, to Him (alone) do you cry for help
But when He removes the harm from you, then (there is ) a party from among you, which associates partners with their Fosterer
so as to be ungrateful for that which We have given them. So enjoy yourselves, but you will come to know
And they assign a portion from that which We have provided them, to that which they do not (even) know. By Allah, you will definitely be asked about that which you forged
And they assign daughters to Allah, far it is from His Glory, and for themselves what they will
And when one of them is given the news of (the birth of a) girl, his face is shadowed black and he becomes a restless restrainer (of grief)
He hides himself from the people because of the (presumed) bad news which is given to him, shall he retain her in shame or bury her in the soil? Beware! evil is that which they decide
For those who do not believe in the hereafter, there is an evil similitude and for Allah is the highest similitude, and He is the Mighty, the Wise
And had Allah caught mankind for their injustice, He would not have left on the (earth) any moving creature, but He gives them time till an appointed term, so when their term comes (to an end), they will neither be able to postpone the hour of doom nor advance (it)
And they assign to Allah what they (themselves) dislike, and their tongues utter the lie, that the good is for them. Assuredly, for them is the fire and they will be the first to be sent (into it)
By Allah, We had sent (messengers) to the communities before you but the devil made their deeds fair-seeming to them, so he is their friend this day and for them there is a painful punishment
And We sent down the book to you so that you should make clear to them that about which they disagree and (that it should serve as) a guidance and a mercy for a people who believe
And Allah sends down water from the sky and gives life through it to the earth after its death, there is certainly a sign in that for a people who listen
And there is certainly a lesson for you in the cattle. We give you to drink from that which is in their stomachs, (formed) from (the conjunction) between the particles of food in the intestine and blood, pure milk, agreeable for those who drink (it)
And from the fruits of the date palms and the grapes, you take (out) intoxicants there from and (also) good provision (in the form of food). There is certainly a sign in that for a people who understand
And your Fosterer communicated to the bee that it should take residence (by making hives) in the mountains and in the trees and on (buildings) which the men rise high
then eat from all fruits and move in the ways of your Fosterer in humility*. There comes forth from their stomachs a drink, the varieties (colours) of which are different, there is healing in it for mankind. There is certainly a sign in that for a people who reflect. *This movement may be the bee’s dance which is a means of communication to other bee’s
And Allah creates you then He takes you back (causes you to die) and among you is he who (on account of old age) is brought back to the worst part of life, so that he does not know anything (even) after (having had) knowledge. Allah is certainly Knowing, Powerful
And Allah has made some of you to excel others in provision. So those who are made to excel do not give away their provision to those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, so that they all become equal in it. Then is it the favour of Allah (which) they deny
And Allah has made for you, from among yourselves, mates and made for you through your mates sons (and daughters) and grandsons (and grand-daughters) and has provided you of the good things. Then is it falsehood in which they believe and are ungrateful for the favour of Allah
And they serve besides Allah, that which does not control for them anything of the provision from the skies and the earth, nor do they have any power
So do not set forth similitude’s for Allah, Allah certainly knows and you do not know
Allah sets forth a similitude: a slave under someone’s control, having no power on anything; and (another person) whom We have provided from Ourselves a good provision so that he spends from it secretly and openly; are they equal? Praise is due only for Allah. No! the majority of them does not know
And Allah sets forth (another) similitude (of) two men, one of them dumb having no power on anything and he is a burden on his guardian, in whichever direction he sends him he brings no good; is he equal to (one) who enjoins justice and is on the straight path
And Allah’s is the unseen of the skies and the earth and the affair of the hour of doom will be like the twinkling of the eye or it may be quicker, Allah certainly has power over everything
And Allah brought you out form the wombs of your mothers (when) you did not know anything and gave you the (senses of) hearing and seeing, and the hearts that you may be grateful
Did you not see towards the birds compelled (to follow His laws) in the space of the sky, no one holds them but Allah, there are certainly signs in that for a people who believe
And (it is) Allah (Who) has made your houses as places of rest for you and He has made for you houses (tents) from the skins of cattle which you find light to carry on the day you travel and on the day you halt (camp), and of their wool and their fur and their hair( you make) things of necessity and (it is) a provision till a time
And (it is) Allah (Who) has made shelters for you from (things) which He created and He has made (places of) refuge for you in the mountains and made for you garments to protect you from the heat and garments to protect you in your fighting. Thus He completes His favor on you that you may submit (to Him)
But if they turn away, then (the only duty incumbent) on you is clear conveyance (of the message)
They recognize the favor of Allah (even) then (they behave as if) they have not recognized it, and the majority of them is ungrateful
And on the day when We will raise a witness from every community, then (on that day), those who did not believe will not be excused, nor will they be able to seek good will
And when those who did injustice will see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them nor will they be given time
And when those who associate partners (with Allah) will see their (presumed) partners, they will say, “ Our Fosterer! these are our (presumed) partners to whom we used to pray besides You.” But they will throw back ( the reply ) to them by saying, “You are certainly liars.”
And on that day they will offer submission before Allah, and that which they used to forge will go away from them
Those who do not believe and turn away (people) from the way of Allah, We will increase for them the punishment over (their) punishment because they used to cause corruption
And on the day when We will raise from every community a witness against them from among themselves, then (on that day) We will bring you (as) a witness against these. And We have sent down on you the book (which gives) an explanation for everything, and (it is) a guide and a mercy and good news for those who submit (as Muslims)
Allah certainly enjoins doing of justice and good (to others) and giving to relatives, and He forbids indecency and (things) not recognized (as good) and rebellion, He admonishes you that you may be mindful
And fulfill the agreement of Allah when you have made an agreement (with Him) and do not break the oaths after you have confirmed them when you have made Allah surety over you. Allah certainly knows that which you do
And do not be like her who breaks her thread, disintegrating it into pieces after it has been (spun) strong, (by) taking your oaths (as means of) deceit between you that you may become a community more elevated (or numerous) than (another) community. Allah only tests you through it, and He will definitely make clear to you on the day of resurrection, that in which you disagreed
And had Allah willed He would have made you a single community, but He leaves astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills and you will definitely be asked about that which you used to do
And do not take your oaths (as a means of) deceit between you, so that your foot should slip after its establishment, and you should taste evil because you turned away (people) from the way of Allah and there should be a great punishment for you
And do not sell the agreement of Allah for a small price. Only that which is with Allah is better for you if you were to know
That which is with you passes away and that which is with Allah remains. And We will definitely reward, those who are patient, with their reward (which will be) better than that which they used to do
Whoever does righteous work, whether male or female and he/she is a believer, We will definitely cause him/her to live a good life and We will definitely reward them with their reward (which will be) better than that which they used to do
So when you recite the Quran, seek the protection of Allah from the accursed devil
he certainly has no authority over those who believe and put their trust in their Fosterer
he has authority only on those who turn to him (for friendship) and those who are polytheists because of him
And when We change (one) sign in the place of (another) sign, and Allah knows best that which He sends down, they say, “You are only a forger.” No! the majority of them does not know
Say, “The holy spirit has brought it down from your Fosterer in truth, that those who believe may be established, and (it is) a guidance and good news for those who submit (as Muslims).”
And We indeed know that they say, “Only a man teaches him.” The language of the person towards whom they incline (doubting that he teaches the messenger of Allah) is foreign and this is clear Arabic language
Those who do not believe in the signs of Allah, Allah will certainly not guide them for them and there is a painful punishment
Only they who do not believe in the signs of Allah, forge falsehood and those are the persons who are liars
He who does not believe in Allah after his having believed (in Him), except he who is compelled while his heart is peaceful with belief, but he who opens (his) bosom for infidelity, then on them is anger from Allah and for them there is a great punishment
That is because they love the life of this world more than the hereafter and because Allah does not guide a people who are infidels
Those are the persons on whose hearts and their hearing and their eyes Allah has set a seal and those are the persons who are heedless
Assuredly, they will be the persons who will be at loss in the hereafter
Then certainly your Fosterer, for those who migrated after they are persecuted then struggled and were patient, your Fosterer, after that, is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
(One) day every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will be paid back in full (for) that which it did and they will not be dealt with unjustly
And Allah sets forth a similitude of a town (which was) secure, peaceful, its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, then it became ungrateful to Allah’s favors, so Allah made it taste the confusion of hunger and fear because of the (evil) they used to do
And there had come to them a messenger from among them but they denied him so the punishment seized them while they were unjust
So eat the lawful and good (things) from that which Allah has provided for you and be grateful for Allah’s favor, if it is Him alone you serve (worship)
He has forbidden for you only: the dead and blood and flesh of swine and that over which (a name) other than that of Allah has been invoked, but one who is driven to necessity (being helplessly forced to eat) neither desiring it nor revolting, then Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And do not say regarding (anything) which is (based just on) the false utterances of your tongues, “This is lawful and this is unlawful,” so as to forge (a lie) against Allah, those who forge a lie against Allah will certainly not be successful
A little enjoyment and (then) there will be a painful punishment for them
And on those who are Jews, We had made unlawful that which We narrated to you earlier and We did not do injustice to them but they were unjust to themselves
Then your Fosterer, for those who do evil in ignorance then repent after that and amend (themselves), your Fosterer, after that, is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Ibrahim was certainly a leader obedient to Allah, upright, and he was not of the polytheists
grateful for His favors, He chose him and guided him to the straight path
And We gave him good in this world and in the hereafter he will certainly be among the righteous
Then We communicated to you that you should follow the religious dictates of Ibrahim the upright and he was not of the polytheists
The Sabbath was appointed only for those who disagreed about it and your Fosterer will certainly judge between them, on the day of resurrection, regarding that in which they used to disagree
Invite to the way of your Fosterer with wisdom and good admonition and dispute with them in (a manner) which is the best. Your Fosterer certainly knows best about him who goes astray from His path and He knows best those who are guided
And if you retaliate then retaliate in a manner similar to that in which you are afflicted, but if you are patient, (then) that is certainly the best for those who are patient
And be patient, and your patience is not (due to anything) but by (the help of) Allah and do not grieve over them nor be in a state of distress because of that which they plan
Allah is certainly with those who guard (against evil) and those who are doers of good
Glorified be He Who made His servant travel on a night from the Masjid-il-Haram (Kaaba) to the Masjid-il-Aqsa (in Jerusalam) the neighborhood of which We have blessed, that We might show him (some) of Our signs . He is certainly the Hearing, the Seeing
And We gave Musa the book and made it a (source of) guidance for the children of Israel (in which it was stated) that: “Do not take a trustee besides Me,”
(they were) the descendants of those whom We carried (in the ship) along with Nuh, he was certainly a grateful servant
And We had decreed for the children of Israel in the book, that you will definitely cause corruption in the earth twice and you will definitely transgress (with) a great transgression
So when (the time for) the first of the two promises came, We raised against you Our servants of severe might who entered into the very spaces in between (your) houses, and the promise was fulfilled
Then We gave you back (your) turn (to prevail) over them and We helped you with wealth and sons and We made you a party more numerous
If you do good, you do good for your own selves and if you do evil then it is against it (your own self). Then when (the time for) the second promise came (We raised your enemies against you) that they may spoil your faces and that they may enter the mosque as they had entered it the first time and that they may destroy with utter destruction whatever they conquered
Perhaps your Fosterer will have mercy on you, but if you return (to disobedience) We (too) will return (to punishment) and We have made hell, a prison for the infidels
This Quran certainly guides to that which is the straightest, and gives good news to the believers who do righteous works that for them there is a great reward
and that, those who do not believe in the hereafter, We have prepared a painful punishment for them
And man prays for evil as he ought to pray for good, for man is hasty (by temperament)
And We have made the night and the day two signs, then We darken the sign of the night and make the sign of the day visible that you may seek the grace of your Fosterer and that you may know the numbering of years and (keep) the account (of your works). And We have explained everything in detail
And We have made every man’s fate (or action) to cling to his neck , and We will bring out for him on the day of resurrection, a book (or a record) which he will find wide open
(It will be said to him), “Read your book, this day your own self is sufficient against you as one who takes account.”
He who receives guidance receives it only for (the benefit of) his own self and he who goes astray, (the loss of) his going astray is only on him. And no bearer of a burden will bear the burden of another. And We do not punish until We have raised a messenger
And when We intend to destroy a town, We send our commandment to those who are well-off therein, but they transgress in it, thus the word is proved true against the (town), then We destroy it with utter destruction
And how many of the generations have We destroyed after Nuh, and your Fosterer is sufficient (as) One Informed, seeing the sins of His servants
Whoever intends (the comfort of the life of this world) which hasten away, We hasten it for him therein what We will (and) for whom We intend, then We appoint hell for him, he will enter it disgraced, driven away
And whoever intends (to achieve the benefits of) the hereafter and strives for it (with the) striving (due for) it while he is a believer, then those are the persons whose striving will be acknowledged
We help all, these as well as those, from the bounty of your Fosterer, and the bounty of your Fosterer is not confined
See how We have made some of them to excel others, and the hereafter is certainly greater in grades and greater in excellence
Do not set up another god with Allah, lest you sit down disgraced, forsaken
And your Fosterer has decreed that you should not serve anyone except Him and (that you should do) good to parents. If one of them or both of them reach old age in your presence, then do not say (even), “Uff,” to them nor scold them, but speak to them in words of honour
and lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say , “My Fosterer ! have mercy on them in a manner similar to the manner in which they fostered me when I was a small (child).”
Your Fosterer knows best about that which is in your souls (minds). If you are of those who are righteous, then He is certainly Protectively Forgiving to those who turn (to Him)
And give to the relative his due, and (also to) the needy and (to) the wayfarer, and do not squander (just) squandering (away)
The squanderers are certainly the brothers of the devils, and the devil was ungrateful to his Fosterer (by disobeying Him)
And (not having anything to give as charity), if you have to turn away from them seeking mercy from your Fosterer which you hope for, then speak to them (in) words which make them feel easy
And do not make your hand tied to your neck nor stretch it to its full stretching (capacity) lest you sit down blamed, full of regrets
Your Fosterer certainly enlarges the provision for whom He wills and He straitens (it whenever and for whomever He wills), He is certainly informed of His servants, seeing (them)
And do not kill your children for fear of poverty, We provide for them and for yourselves (too). Killing them is certainly a great mistake
And do not (even) go near adultery, it is certainly indecent and an evil way
And do not kill any person, whose (killing) Allah has made unlawful except (when his killing is) for the right (cause). And whoever is killed unjustly, then We have given authority to his heir, so let his (heir) not exceed the limits in killing (because) he is helped (by the law)
And do not go near the wealth of an orphan, except in (a manner) which is the best, till he reaches his (age of physical and mental) strength. And fulfill the agreement, (you will) certainly be questioned (about) the agreement you had made
And give back in full, the measure which you measure, and weigh with a balance that is straight. That is good and best (from the point of view of) the result
And do not follow that about which you do not have (any) knowledge, the hearing and the sight and the heart, regarding each of those (you) will certainly be questioned
And do not walk proudly in the earth, you can neither tear the earth nor can you ever reach the mountains in height
The evil of all that (which is mentioned above) is disliked by your Fosterer
That is from what your Fosterer has communicated to you of wisdom. And do not set up another god with Allah, lest you should be put in hell, blamed, driven away
Then has your Fosterer selected sons for you and He has (Himself) taken daughters from among the angels? You certainly utter a greatly( dreadful )saying
And We have repeated (various subjects) in this Quran that they may be mindful, but that increases in them nothing but hatred
Say, “Had there been (other) gods along with Him as they say, then they would have sought a way to the (Real) Owner of the throne (of the universe).”
Glory be to Him and He is high above that which they say, Exalted, Great
The seven skies and the earth and whoever is in them, (all) declare His glory, and there is nothing which does not glorify Him by praising Him but you do not understand their glorification. He is certainly Clement, Protectively Forgiving
And when you recite the Quran, We place between you and those who do not believe in the hereafter, an invisible veil
And We have placed coverings over their hearts, lest they understand it, and in their ears is heaviness, and when you mention (about) your single Fosterer in the Quran, they turn on their backs in hatred
We know best about that which they wish to hear when they seek to hear you, and when they have secret talks when the unjust say, “ You follow none except a man under the influence of magic.”
See how they strike similes for you, thus they are astray so they cannot find (the right) way
And they say, “What! when we become bones and powder, will we be raised (as) a new creation?”
Say, “Become stones or iron
or a creation from (something) which you consider great in your minds.” Then they will say, “Who will return us (to life)?” Say, “He Who initiated your creation the first time.” Then they will shake their heads towards you and say, “When will it be?” Say, “Perhaps it is near
on the day He will call you, you will respond by praising Him and you will think that you stayed but for a little while.”
And say to My servants, “Speak that which is the best,” the devil certainly instigates (evil) between them. The devil is certainly an open enemy of man
Your Fosterer knows best about you, If He wills he will have mercy on you and if He wills He will punish you, and We have not sent you as a trustee over them
And your Fosterer knows best about whomsoever is in the skies and the earth. And We have made some of the prophets to excel others, and We gave Dawood, Zabur (the book)
Say, “Pray to those whom you claim (to be gods) besides Him, they do not have the power to remove (any) harm from you nor (even) to change (it).”
Those whom they pray to, they themselves seek the means of access to their Fosterer (competing to see) which of them is nearer, and they hope for His mercy and fear His punishment. The punishment of your Fosterer is certainly something to be cautious of
And there is not a town but We will destroy it before the day of resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment, that is written in the book
And nothing prevents Us from sending the signs except that the ancients (too) denied them. And We gave to Samood, the she-camel which could be seen (clearly), but they were unjust to it (by killing it); and We do not send signs but (to cause) fear
And (remember) when We said to you, “Your Fosterer certainly encompasses mankind.” And We did not make the vision which We showed you but a trial for mankind and (also) the cursed tree (mentioned) in the Quran, and We cause them to fear, but it increases them in nothing except a great rebellion
And when We said to the angels, “Bow down to Adam,” they bowed down except Iblis, he said, “Shall I bow down to him whom You created (of) clay?”
He (Iblis) said, “Do you see the (person) whom You have honored above me? If You give me time till the day of resurrection I will definitely bring his descendants under my control (all) but a few.”
He (Allah) said, “Go, and whoever follows you from among them, then hell will certainly be your reward, an ample reward
And upset and dislodge with your voice whom you can from among them, and collect (your forces) against them (to attack them riding) on your horse and (marching on) your foot (that is, all means at your disposal), and have a share with them in their wealth and children making promises to them. And the devil promises them nothing but deceit
You certainly have no authority on My servants and your Fosterer is sufficient (as) a Trustee.”
Your Fosterer is He Who makes the ships to sail in the sea for you that you may seek from His grace, He is certainly Merciful to you
And when harm afflicts you in the sea, (all) whom you pray to, go away (from your minds) except Him, but when He brings you safe to the land, you turn away (from Him). And man is ungrateful
Then do you feel secure that He cannot cause you to sink on a tract of land or send a sand storm on you? Then you will not find for yourselves any trustee
Or do you feel secure that He cannot take you back into it (your plight in the sea) a second time, then send against you a violent wind so as to drown you because of your ungratefulness? Then in that (case) you will not find for yourselves any helper against Us
And We have honored the children of Adam, and We carry them ion the land and in the sea, and We provide for them from the good things, and We have preferred them in excellence over many of those whom We have created
(One) day We will call all mankind with their leaders, then whoever is given his record (of deeds)in his right hand, they will read their record and they will not be dealt with unjustly even to the extent of the hair on a date stone
And whoever is blind in this (world) then he will be blind in the hereafter, and more astray form the way
And they were about to tempt you away from that which We have communicated to you, so as to make you forge against Us (something) other than what (We had communicated), and (if you had obeyed), then they would have taken you as a friend
And had We not made you firm, you were about to incline towards them to some extent
then in that case We would have made you taste double (punishment in this) life and double (punishment in) death, then you would not have found any helper against Us
And they were about to unsettle you from the land, so as to drive you out of it, and in that case they would not have stayed (therein) after you, except for a little while
(This was Our) procedure with those of Our messengers whom We had sent before you and you will not find a change in Our procedure
Establish worship (salat) from the decline of the sun till the darkness of the night, and (recite) the Quran at dawn, (recitation of) the Quran at dawn is certainly witnessed
And forsake sleep for (worshiping during part) of the night. (This is) an additional (duty) for you. May be that your Fosterer will raise you to a praised position
And say, “My Fosterer! cause me to enter the entrance of truth and cause me to exit the exit of truth and grant me from Your presence a helping authority.”
And say, “The truth has come and falsehood departed. Falsehood is certainly bound to depart.”
And We have sent down through the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy for the believers; and to those who are unjust, it adds nothing but loss
And when We bestow favor on man, he keeps away and turns away to his side and when harm afflicts him, he is despairing
Say, “Everyone acts according to the scope allowed to him, (through his inherent character or destiny) but your Fosterer knows best, about him who is best guided on the way.”
And they ask you about the Spirit (Ruh), say, “The Spirit (comes) with the command of my Fosterer$, and you have been given little knowledge,”(therefore you cannot understand everything). $ Or, the Sprit is from one of the affairs of my Fosterer
And if We will We can definitely take away that which We have communicated to you, then you would not find for it any trustee (in whom you could put your trust) against Us
but (this has not been done because of ) the mercy from your Fosterer. His grace on you is certainly great
Say, “If mankind and jinn were to gather together on (the project of) bringing (out) a Quran similar to this, they would not be able to bring (out anything) similar to it, even if they help each other.”
And in this Quran, We have repeated for mankind every kind of similitude, but the majority of mankind refuses (to understand, and accept nothing) but infidelity
And they say, “We will never believe in you till you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us
Or you have a garden of date palms and grapes and cause gushing out rivers to gush forth in spaces between the (trees of the garden)
Or you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces as you claim, or you bring Allah and the angels face to face (with us)
Or you have a house of gold or you climb into the sky, and we will not believe in your climbing till you bring down to us a book which we could read.” Say, “Glory be to my Fosterer! am I anything but a human (news giving) messenger?”
And nothing prevents mankind from believing when the guidance comes to them, except that they say, “Has Allah raised up a human being as a messenger?”
Say, “Had there been angles walking about as settlers in the earth, We would have sent down to them an angel as a messenger form the sky.”
Say, “Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and you, He is certainly informed of and seeing His servants.”
And whomsoever Allah guides, then he (it) is (who is really) guided, But whomsoever He leaves in error, then you will not find for him guardians besides Him; and We will gather them on the day of resurrection on their faces, blind and dumb and deaf, their settling place will be hell, whenever (the fire tends to get) extinguished, We will increase for them the blazing flame
That is their reward because they did not believe in Our signs and said, “What! when we become bones and powder, will we then be raised up (as) a new creation?”
Do they not consider that Allah Who created the skies and the earth is able to create their like? And He has appointed for them a term about which there is no doubt, except unjust refuse (everything) but the infidelity
Say, “Had you (any) control on the treasures of the mercy of my Fosterer, then you would have held back (the treasures, due to the) fear that they will be spent off, and man is niggardly.”
And We did give to Musa nine signs (as) clear proofs, so ask the children of Israel (about the details) when he had come to them (with these signs). But Firawn said to him, “I definitely consider you, O Musa, one under the influence of magic.”
He said, “You do know that none has sent down these (signs) but the Fosterer of the skies and the earth (as) visual proofs, and I definitely consider you, O Firawn, one destroyed.”
So he (Firawn) intended to upset and dislodge them from the land, so We drowned him and those with him all together
And We said to the children of Israel after him, “Dwell in the earth, but when the promise of the hereafter comes to pass, We will bring you together (as a gathering of people coming from different directions).”
And We have sent it down in reality and it has come down in reality, and We have not sent you but as a conveyer of good news and a warner
And We have divided the Quran (in such a manner) that you may recite it to mankind at intervals, and (therefore) We have sent it down, sending it down gradually
Say, “Believe in it or do not believe.” When it is read out to those who were given knowledge before it, they certainly fall down on their faces prostrating
and saying, “Glory be to our Fosterer, the promise of our Fosterer was surely to be fulfilled.”
And they fall down on their faces weeping and it increases their humility
Say “Call upon (God by the name of) Allah or call upon (God by the name of) Rehman (the Beneficent), (by) whichever (name) you call (Him), His are the best names. And do not be loud voiced in your worship (salat) nor be silent in it, but seek a way between these.”
And say “Praise is due only for Allah Who has not taken a son and Who has no partner in the kingdom and who needs no guardian due to weakness (which He does not have),” and regard Him Great by proclaiming His Greatness
Praise is due only for Allah Who has sent down the book to His servant and has not kept any crookedness in it
(and has made it ) straight, that He may give warning of a severe punishment from Him, and ( convey ) good news to the believers who do righteous works, that for them there will be a good reward
in which they will stay for ever
and (also) warn those who say, “Allah has taken a son.”
Neither they have any knowledge of it nor their fathers (had). (It is a) grievous word that comes out of their mouths, they speak nothing but a lie
If they do not believe in this statement, then perhaps you will kill yourself with grief, sorrowing after them
We have made that which is on the earth an adornment for it, so that We may test them as to which of them is best in conduct
And We will make that which is on it, a barren ground
Or do you think that the companions of the cave and the inscription were a wonder from among Our signs
when the young men sought refuge in the cave and said, “Our Fosterer! give us mercy from Yourself and shape for us the right way in our affair?”
So We prevented them from hearing (and kept them sleeping) in the cave, for a number of years
Then We raised them up that We might know (mark out) which of the two parties was better at calculating the time for which they stayed
We narrate to you their news in truth, they were young men (who) believed in their Fosterer, and We increased them in guidance
and We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said, “Our Fosterer is the Fosterer of the skies and the earth, we will never pray to any god besides Him, for then we would have indeed said something far away from truth
These our people have taken gods besides Him, why do they do not bring clear authority (in support) for them? So who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah
And when you withdraw from them and that which they serve (worship) except Allah, then seek refuge in the cave, your Fosterer will shower His mercy upon you and shape an easy course for you in your affair.”
And you would have seen the sun when it rose, move away from their cave to the right and when it set, go past them on the left, and they were in a wide space thereof. That is of the signs of Allah. Whomsoever Allah guides, he (it is who) is (really) guided and whomsoever He leaves in error, then you will never find for him a guardian showing the right way
And you might have thought them to be awake though they were asleep, and We turned them to their right and their left, and their dog lay at the entrance with its paws stretched out. Had you looked at them you would have surely turned away from them in flight, and you would have been filled with terror because of them
And thus We raised them up that they may ask each other. A speaker from among them said, “How long have you stayed (here)?” They said, “We stayed (here) a day or a part of a day.” (Others) said, “Your Fosterer knows best about how long you stayed (here). Now send one of you to the city with this silver coin of yours and let him see what food is pure, then let him come to you with (some) provision from it, and let him be courteous and let no one know about you
for if they prevail over you, they will stone you or turn you back to their religious dictates and then you will not succeed for ever.”
And thus did We make their case known (to people) that they might know that Allah’s promise is true and that (as for) the hour of doom, there is no doubt about it. When the (people of the city) disputed among themselves about their affair and said, “Construct a building over them,” their Fosterer knew best about them. Those who prevailed over their affair said, “We will definitely make a place of worship over them.”
(Some) will say, “(They were) three, their dog being the fourth of them,” while (others) will say, “(They were) five, their dog being the sixth of them.” (They were) seven, their dog being eight of them.” Say, “My fosterer knows best, their number, no one knows them except a few.” So do not dispute about them except a with a superfluous disputation and do not ask any of them about the (companions of the cave)
And do not say about anything, “I will do that tomorrow,”
without (adding to it),“If Allah wills.” And remember your Fosterer when you forget, and say, “It may be that my Fosterer will guide me to (something) more closer to that which is right, than this.”
And they stayed in their cave (for) three hundred years and add nine
Say, “Allah knows best how long they stayed, His is the unseen of the skies and the earth, how clear His sight and how clear His hearing. They have no guardian besides Him and He makes none to share His commandment.”
And read that which has been communicated to you from the book of your Fosterer, there is none who can change His statements and you will never find any refuge beside Him
And restrain yourself with those who pray to their Fosterer at morning and evening, intending (to seek) His Attention and do not let your eyes pass beyond them intending (to seek) the adornment of the life of this world and do not obey him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desires and whose affair exceeds due bounds
And say, “(This Quran is) the truth from your Fosterer, so whosoever wills, let him believe and whosoever wills, let him reject. ”We have prepared for those who are unjust, a fire, an enclosure of which will encompass them, and if they ask for water, they will be given water like molten brass which will burn their faces, evil the drink and ill the resting place
Those who believe and do righteous works, (they will have their reward, because) We certainly do not waste the reward of him who does good work
Those are the persons for whom there are everlasting gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and they will wear green robes of fine silk and thick silk brocade interwoven with gold, reclining therein on raised couches, excellent the reward and good the resting place
And set forth to them the similitude of two men: We had assigned to one of them two gardens of grapes and We had surrounded them both with date palms and placed between them fields (of vegetation)
Each of the two gardens gave its food produce and nothing got reduced from it, and We caused a river to gush forth in the space in between them
and (its) fruit was (totally) his. So he said to his companion while he conversed with him, “I have more wealth than you and I am mightier in the party (of followers)
And he entered his garden while he was unjust to himself. He said, “I do not think that this will ever perish
and I do not think that the hour of doom will be established and even if I am brought back to my Fosterer I will definitely find a place of return better than this
His companion said to him while he conversed with him, "Are you ungrateful to Him Who created you from the soil then from the sperm then granted equilibrium to you (in the form of) a man
But as for me, Allah is my Fosterer and I do not associate anything as a partner with my Fosterer
And when you entered your garden why did you not say: That which Allah willed (is in my possession), there is no power except (that) of Allah? If you see me that I am lesser than you in wealth and children
then it may be that my Fosterer will give me (something)better than your garden and will send on it thunderbolts from the sky so that it will become a smooth ground
or He will make its water go deep so that you will never be able to obtain it (again)
And his fruits were encompassed (with destruction), and it fell down on its roofs (trellises) so he began to wring his hands (in regret) on what he had spent on it, and said, "I wish I had not associated anything as a partner with my Fosterer
And he had no group (of his followers) to help him, besides Allah, nor could he defend himself
There : Protection is the right (only) of Allah, He is the Best Rewarder and the Best Requiter
And set forth to them the similitude of the life of this world: (It is) like water which We send down from the sky, then the vegetation of the earth mixes up with it then it becomes dry broken pieces which the winds scatter, and Allah is the Holder of power over everything
Wealth and sons are an adornment of the life of this world, but the righteous works that remain are better in the sight of your Fosterer in reward and better in respect of hope
And one day We will cause the mountains to move away and you will see the earth appearing plain and We will gather them so that We will not leave anyone of them
and they will be presented before your Fosterer in ranks. (It will be said), "You have come to Us as We had created you the first time. No ! you thought that We had not appointed for you a time/place for the fulfilment of the promise
and the records (of deeds) will be placed, then you will see the criminals fearful of that which is in it and they will say, Ah! sorrowful is our state! what a record (of deeds) is this, it has not left (anything) small or great but has computed it." And they will find (all) that they did, present (in it), and your Fosterer does not deal unjustly with anyone
And when We said to the angels, "Bow down before Adam," so they (all) bowed down except Iblis, he was of the jinn so he went beyond the limits of the commandment of his Fosterer. What ! would you then take him and his descendants as friends besides Me while they are your enemies ? (The friendship of Iblis, compared to the friendship of Allah, is) an evil exchange for those who are unjust
I did not make them witness the creation of the skies and the earth nor their own creation and I am not One to take misleaders as helpers
And the day (when) He will say, "Call those whom you claimed to be My partners." So they will call them but they will not respond to them and We will make a partition between them
And (when) the criminals will see the fire, then they will guess that they have to fall into it, and they will not find (any way) of turning away from it
And We have indeed repeated in this Quran, every kind of similitude for mankind, but man is disputing in most of the things
And nothing holds back mankind from believing when the guidance comes to them, and from asking protective forgiveness from their Fosterer, except that (they wait) that the procedure (adopted) for the ancients should be adopted for them (too), or (that) the punishment should come face to face (with them)
And We do not send the messengers but as conveyers of good news and warners. And those who are infidels dispute, (basing their argument) on falsehood, in order to weaken thereby the truth, and they take My signs and that with which they are warned, as mockery
And who is more unjust than he who is reminded through the signs of his Fosterer but he turns away from them and forgets what his hands have sent forth ? We have certainly placed veils over their hearts lest they should understand the (Quran) and heaviness in their ears, and if you invite them towards guidance, even then they will not accept guidance for ever
And your Fosterer is Protectively Forgiving, Possessor of mercy. Had He caught them for that which they earned, He would have hastened the punishment for them, no, for them there is an appointed time from which they will not find a refuge
And those towns : We destroyed them when they were unjust, and We had appointed a fixed time for their destruction
And when Musa said to his servant, "I will not give up until I reach the junction of the two seas or I will march on for ages
So when they reached the junction between the two (seas), they both forgot their fish, so it took its way into the sea freely
So when they had gone further (after crossing the junction), he said to his servant, "Bring to us our morning meal, we have met with fatigue from this journey of ours
He (the servant) said, "Did you see! when we stayed on the rock, I forgot the fish, and nothing made me forget to mention it (to you) but the devil, and it took its way into the sea (in) a wonderful (way)
He (Musa) said, "That is what we have been seeking for.” So they returned retracing their footsteps
(and) thus they found a servant from among Our servants whom We had given mercy from Us and whom We had given knowledge from Our knowledge
Musa said to him, "May I follow you on (the agreement) that you teach me right (knowledge) from that which you have been taught
He said, “You will not be able to be patient with me
And how can you have patience on (matters) about which you do not have comprehensive information
He (Musa) said, "You will find me, if Allah wills, patient. And I will not disobey you in any matter
He said, "Well, if you follow me then do not ask me about anything till I myself mention about it to you
So they both proceeded until when they embarked in a boat, he made a hole in it. He (Musa) said, "Have you made a hole in it to drown those in it? You have indeed come with something strange
He said, "Did I not tell you that you will not be able to be patient with me
He (Musa) said, "Do not catch me for what I forgot and do not involve me in difficulty in my affair
Then they proceeded until when they met a young man and he killed him. He (Musa) said, "Have you killed an innocent person without (this murder being in retaliation to his unjustly killing some other) person ? You have indeed come with something unrecognised
He said, "Did I not tell you that you will certainly not be able to be patient with me
He (Musa) said, "If I ask you about anything after this then do not keep me in your company, you would have indeed reached (a point of not accepting any) excuse from my side
Then they proceeded until when they came to a people of a town. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to make them guests. Then they found in it a wall on the point of falling down, so he set it right. He (Musa) said, "Had you willed you could have taken a reward for it
He said, “This is (the point of) parting between me and you. I will inform you of the interpretation of that over which you were not able to be patient
As for the boat, it belongs to poor people who work in the sea, I intended to make it defective because there is a king who is after them (and) he takes every boat by force
And as for the young man, his parents are believers and we feared that he will involve them both in rebellion and infidelity
so we desired that their Fosterer should give them in exchange, (one) better than him in purity and nearer to mercy
And as for the wall, it belongs to two orphan boys in the city and beneath it there is a treasure for them and their father was a righteous man, so your Fosterer intended that they should reach their (age of strength and take out their treasure, a mercy from your Fosterer and I did not do it of my own accord. That is the interpretation of that over which you were not able to be patient)
And they ask you about Zulqarnain (Two horned one), say, "I will tell you (something) from his history
We certainly established him in the earth and gave him means of (access to) everything
So he followed a way
until when he reached the setting place of the sun (west), he found it setting in a black muddy spring (or Black Sea) and found near it a people. We said, "O Zulqarnain ! either punish or treat them in a good manner
He said, "As for him who is unjust we will punish him then he will be returned to his Fosterer then He will punish him with an awful punishment
And as for him who believes and does righteous work, then his reward will be good and we will speak to him in an easy (tone) with regard to our affair
Then he followed a way
until when he reached the rising place of the sun (east), he found it rising on a people for whom We had not made any shelter from it
Thus! and We had comprehensive information about (all) that was with him
Then he followed a way
until when he reached (a place)between two mountains he found on the other side of the (two mountains) a people who could hardly understand a word
They said, "O Zulqarnain! Yajooj and Majooj are causing corruption in the earth. Then shall we pay you a tribute on (condition) that you make a barrier between us and them
He said, "That in which my Fosterer has established me is better, so help me with strength (workers), I will make between you and them a strong bank (wall)
bring me blocks of iron." Then at the point when he had leveled (the space) between the two mountain sides, he said, "Blow," until when he made it (red hot) fire, he said, "Bring me molten copper which I may pour over it
Thus they all (communities of Yajooj and Majooj) were not able to climb it nor were they able to pierce it
He said, “This is a mercy from my Fosterer but when the promise of my Fosterer comes to pass, He will make it crumble to pieces and the promise of my Fosterer is true
And We will leave some of them that day (to pass like restless) waves into the others and it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe) and We will gather them all together
And We will present hell on that day to the infidels as a presentation
those whose eyes were under a cover from My reminder and they were unable (even) to hear
Then, do those who do not believe think that they can take My servants as guardians besides Me? We have certainly prepared hell (as) an entertainment for the infidels
Say, "Shall We inform you of the greatest losers (in respect of their) works
Those (are the persons) who misdirect their efforts in the life of this world but they think that they are doing good work
Those are the persons who neither believe in the signs of their Fosterer nor (their) meeting with Him, so their works become fruitless, consequently, on the day of resurrection, We (too) will not assign any weight to their (deeds)
That is their reward, hell, because they did not believe and took My signs and My messengers (as items for) mockery
Those who believe and do righteous works, certainly for them, gardens of paradise will be the entertainment
They will stay in it, they will not seek any change from it
Say, "Had the sea been ink for (writing down) the statements of my Fosterer, the sea would get exhausted before the statements of my Fosterer got exhausted, even if We were to bring (another sea) like it to supplement
Say, "I am a man like you. It is communicated to me that your God is One God, so let him who hopes to meet his Fosterer, do righteous work and (let him) not associate anyone with his Fosterer in His service (worship)
Kaaf Haa Yaa Aiin Saad
A mention of the mercy of your Fosterer on His servant Zakariyya
when he prayed to his Fosterer, praying secretly
He said, "My Fosterer! my bones have become weak and my head is shining with grey hair and I have never been unsuccessful in my prayer to you, my Fosterer
And I fear my heirs after me and my wife is barren. So grant me from Yourself a heir
who should inherit me and inherit from the family of Yaqub, and make him, O my Fosterer! pleasing
(It was said), “O Zakariyya! We give you the good news of a son whose name will be Yahya. We did not assign (this) name to anyone before
He said, "My Fosterer! how shall I have a son when my wife is barren and I have reached the extreme degree of old age
It was said, "(It will be) like that, your Fosterer says it is easy for Me and I had created you before when you were nothing
He said, "My Fosterer! make for me a sign," He said, "Your sign is that you will not speak to mankind for three nights (though) in sound health
So he came out to his people from the sanctuary then communicated to them by signs that they should glorify (Allah) morning and evening
O Yahya ! hold the book with strength." And We gave him wisdom (in) childhood (itself)
and compassion from Us and purity, and he was one who guarded (against evil)
and dutiful to his parents and he was not compelling (rebellious), disobedient
And peace be on him on the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he will be raised alive
And mention in the book (about) Maryam when she withdrew from her people to an eastern place
and took a veil (to screen herself) from them. Then We sent to her Our spirit so he appeared to her like a balanced man
She said, "I seek the protection of the Beneficent (Allah) from you if you are one who guards (against evil)
He said, "I am only a messenger of your Fosterer that I may grant to you a pure son
She said, "How can there be a son to me when man has not touched me and I am not one who has exceeded the limits
He said, "(It will be) like that. Your Fosterer says that is easy for Me and that We will make him a sign for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is an affair decided
So she bore him then withdrew with him to a distant place
And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, "I wish I had died before this and had become forgotten (as something) to be forgotten
Then she was called from beneath her, “Do not grieve, your Fosterer has made a rivulet beneath you
and shake the trunk of the date palm towards you, making ripe dates to fall down to you
Then eat and drink and cool (your) eye, and if you see any man then say: I have vowed a fast to the Beneficent, therefore I will not speak to any man today
Then she came to her people carrying him (Isa). They (her people) said, "O Maryam !you have come with a strange thing
O sister of Harun ! your father was not a bad man nor your mother was one who exceeded the limits
So she pointed towards him (Isa, for the explanation). They said, "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?”
He (Isa) said, "I am a servant of Allah, He has given me the book and made me a prophet
And He has made me blessed wherever I may be and has enjoined on me worship (salat) and (giving of) charity (zakat) as long as I live
And (He has made me) dutiful to my mother and has not made me compelling (rebellious), wretched
And peace be on me the day I was born and the day I die and the day I will be raised alive
Such (was) Isa, the son of Maryam. (This is a) statement of the fact about which they doubt
It is not befitting to Allah that He should take to Himself a son, glory be to Him, when He decrees an affair, He says to it only "Be," so it is
And Allah is certainly my Fosterer and your Fosterer so serve Him, this is the straight path
But the parties disagreed among themselves. So sorrowful will be the state of those who do not believe because of their being present on the great day
How clearly will they hear and how clearly will they see on the day they come to Us, but this day the unjust are in clear error
And warn them of the day of regret when the affair will be decided, and (at present) they are in a state of heedlessness and (therefore) they do not believe
We will inherit the earth and whoever is on it and they will be returned to Us. (R)
And mention in the book (about) Ibrahim, he was certainly a truthful man, a prophet
When he said to his father, "O My father! why do you worship that which neither hears nor sees nor does it make you care-free from anything
O my father! there has come to me of knowledge, (something) which has not come to you. So follow me I will guide you to the balanced path
O my father! do not worship the devil, the devil is certainly disobedient to the Beneficent (Allah)
O my father ! I fear that a punishment from the Beneficent (Allah) may afflict you, then you will become a friend of the devil
He said, "Do you forsake my gods O Ibrahim. If you do not desist I will definitely stone you, now go away from me for a long time
He said, "Peace be on you ! I will seek protective forgiveness of my Fosterer for you, He is certainly Gracious to me
And I will withdraw from you and that which you pray to besides Allah, and I will pray to my Fosterer, may be that I will not be unsuccessful in my prayer to my Fosterer
So when he withdrew from them and that which they worshipped besides Allah, We granted to him Ishaq and Yaqub and We made each one of them a prophet
And We granted to them from Our mercy and We assigned to them a high and true renown. (R)
And mention in the book (about) Musa, he was one who was purified and he was a messenger, a prophet
And We called him from the right (hand) side of the Mount Toor and drew him nearer for secret talk
And We granted to him from Our mercy, his brother Harun, a prophet
And mention in the book (about) Ismael, he was truthful in his promise and he was a messenger, a prophet
And he used to enjoin on his people worship (salat) and charity (zakat) and he was one with whom his Fosterer was pleased
And mention in the book (about) Idris, he was a truthful man, a prophet
and We raised him to a high place
Those are the persons on whom Allah bestowed (His) favour, from among the prophets from the descendants of Adam and from among those whom We carried with Nuh (in the ship) and from among the descendants of Ibrahim and Israel and from among those whom We guided and chose, when the communications of the Beneficent (Allah) were read to them they fell down prostrating and weeping
But the successors who succeeded after them wasted their worship (salat) and followed lusty desires, so they will meet (the punishment for their) error
except him who repents and believes and does righteous work, so those will enter the garden and they will not be dealt with unjustly in anything
gardens of everlasting bliss which the Beneficent (Allah) has promised to His servants in the unseen, His promise will certainly come to pass
Therein they will not hear (any) vain talk but peace, and therein there will be their provision for them morning and evening
That is the garden which We will make (those of) Our servants to inherit who had guarded (against evil)
And we do not come down but by the command of your Fosterer, to Him belongs whatever is before us and whatever is behind us and whatever is between that, and your Fosterer is not forgetful
Fosterer of the skies and the earth and that which is between these two. So serve Him and be constant in His service. Do you know (anyone else having the same) name (or attributes, which) belong to Him? (R)
And man says, "What ! when I am dead, will I surely be brought out alive
Does not man remember that We created him before, when he was nothing
So by your Fosterer, We will definitely gather them and the devils, then We will definitely make them to be present around hell on their knees
Then We will definitely pull out from every sect those of them who were most severe in their revolt against the Beneficent (Allah)
Then surely We know best about those who are most worthy to enter therein
And there is not one of you but will pass over it, this is an inevitable decision of your Fosterer
Then We will deliver those who had guarded (against evil) and We will leave in it those who were unjust, on their knees
And when Our clear signs are read to them, those who do not believe say to those who believe, "Which of the two parties (yours or ours) is better in position and better in assembly
And how many of the generations have We destroyed before them, who were better in riches and in appearance (show)
Say, "For one who is in error, the Beneficent (Allah) allows (the rope of leniency) to stretch for him (with a set) stretching, until when they see that which they were promised, either the punishment or the hour of doom, then they will know who is in an evil position and weaker in forces
And Allah increases the guidance of those who receive guidance, and the (permanent) righteous works which remain, are better in the sight of your Fosterer, in respect of reward and better in respect of returns
Then have you seen him who does not believe in Our signs and says, "I will definitely be given wealth and children
Is the unseen disclosed to him or has he made an agreement with the Beneficent (Allah)
By no means, We will write down what he says and We will prolong for him (the period) of punishment (with a set) prolonging
And We will inherit from him what he says and he will come to Us alone
And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be (a source of) might for them
By no means, they (the false gods) will reject their having worshipped them and they will become their opponents
Did you not consider that We send the devils on the infidels to incite them with an incitement
So do not make haste against them, We only number for them, a number (of days)
The day We will gather those who guard (against evil, like honourable) guests before the Beneficent (Allah)
and We will drive the criminals to hell (like) thirsty (cattle)
none will have the power to mediate except him who has received an agreement, (permission) from the Beneficent (Allah)
And they say, "The Beneficent (Allah) has taken (to Him self) a son
You have indeed come with a disastrous thing
The skies are about to cleave asunder due to it and the earth to split asunder and the mountains to fall down in pieces
that they invoke a son for the Beneficent (Allah)
And it does not suit the Beneficent (Allah) that He should take (to Himself) a son
there is no one in the skies and the earth but he comes to the Beneficent (Allah) as a servant
He has computed them and numbered them a numbering
and everyone of them will come to Him on the day of resurrection, alone
Those who believe and do righteous works, the Beneficent (Allah) will certainly assign love for them
So We have made the (Quran) easy in your language only because you should (be able to) convey the good news through it to those who guard (against evil) and warn through it, quarrelsome people
And how many generations have We destroyed before them, do you find anyone of them or hear (even) their whisper? (R 6, P 15 ½)
Taa Haa
We have not sent down the Quran to you, to distress to you, cause
but (it is sent down as) a reminder for him who fears
sent down from Him Who created the earth and the high skies
the Beneficent (Allah), Who is established on the throne (of the universe)
Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is His and (also) that which is between these two and that which is beneath the moist soil
And whether (or not) you are loud in your speech, He certainly knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden
Allah, there is no god but He, His are the best names
And has the story of Musa come to you
when he saw a fire and said to his family, "(You all) wait, I perceive a fire, perhaps I may come to you with a burning brand from it or find guidance at the fire
So when he came to it, he was called, "O Musa
I am your Fosterer, so take off your shoes, you are in the holy valley Tuwa
And I have chosen you so listen to that which is being communicated
I am Allah, there is no god except Me, so serve Me and establish worship (salat) for My remembrance
The hour of doom is certainly coming, I intend to keep it hidden, so that every soul may be rewarded according to the effort it puts in
So do not let him who does not believe in it and follows his own desire, turn you away from it, lest you perish
And what is that in your right hand O Musa
He said "This is my staff, I recline on it and I beat down the leaves with it for my sheep and there are other uses in it for me
He said, "Throw it down O Musa
So when he threw it down it became a moving snake
He said, "Catch it and do not fear, We will return it to its original condition
And put your hand under your armpit it will come out white without (any) harm, another sign
that We may show you (some) of Our great signs
Go to Firawn, he has certainly rebelled." (R)
He said, "My Fosterer expand for me my bosom
and make easy for me my affair
and loose the knot from my tongue
(so that) they should understand what I say
and appoint for me a minister from my family (to help me)
Harun my brother
and strengthen through him my back
and make him my partner in my affair
that we may glorify You much
and remember (or mention) You much
You certainly see us
He said, "You are granted your request, O Musa
And We had bestowed a favour on you another time (earlier)
when We had communicated to your mother that which was communicated
that (she) should put him (Musa) in a box and put the box in the river, then the river will cast him on the bank, (then) he will be taken by one who is an enemy to Me and an enemy to him. And I cast on you love from Me, so that you might be brought up before My eye
When your sister went and said: shall I direct you to one who will take charge of him? Thus We returned you to your mother that her eye might be cooled and (that) she might not grieve. And you killed a man but We delivered you from the distress and We tried you (with a) trial, then you stayed for years among the people of Midian, then you came here according to (My) programme, O Musa. to (My) programme, O Musa
And I have trained you for Myself
You and your brother go with my signs and do not slacken in remembering (or mentioning) Me
Both go to Firawn, he has certainly rebelled
but speak to him a gentle word, perhaps he may be mindful or fear
They said, "Our Fosterer! we fear that he may hasten (to do evil) to us or that he may rebel (against our message)
He said, "Do not fear, I am certainly there with both of you, I do hear and see
So go both of you to him and say: We are messengers of your Fosterer so send the children of Israel with us and do not punish them, we have come to you with a sign from your Fosterer, and peace will be on him who follows the guidance
It has been communicated to us that punishment (will be inflicted) on him who denies and turns away
He (Firawn) said, "So who is the Fosterer of you two, O Musa
He said, "Our Fosterer is He Who gave to everything its creation (or character), then guided (it)
He said, "Then what is the condition of earlier generations
He said, "The knowledge of that is in a record with my Fosterer. My Fosterer neither errs nor forgets
He (it is) Who has made the earth habitable for you, and made roads for you therein, and sent down water from the sky then We brought out through it various kinds of vegetation
(so that you may) eat and feed your cattle, certainly there are signs in that for possessors of sense
From the (earth) We created you and into it We will return you and from it We will bring you out a second time
And We showed him (Firawn) all Our signs but he denied and refused
He said, "Have you come to drive us out from our land through your magic, O Musa
So we too will definitely produce before you magic similar to it, therefore let there be an appointment between us and you which we shall not break, neither we nor you, at a (neutral) place (where both have) equal (opportunity of victory)
He said, "Your appointment is on the day of adornment (festival) and let the people gather (before) noon
So Firawn went away and brought together (all magicians and made arrangements for) his plan, then came (back)
Musa said to them, "Sorrowful is your state, do not forge a lie against Allah lest He destroy you by punishment, and one who forges (a lie) surely fails
So they disputed among themselves about their affair but kept their talk secret
They said, "These two are surely magicians who intend to drive you out of your land by their magic and do away with your exemplary traditions
So collectively decide (about) your plan, then come in ranks, so one who is uppermost this day will indeed be successful
They said, "O Musa! will you throw or shall we be the first to throw
He said, "No! you throw." So when (they threw), their ropes and their rods appeared to him, due to their magic, as if they were in motion
So Musa conceived a fear in his mind
We said, "Do not fear, you will certainly be uppermost
and throw that which is in your right hand, it will swallow that which they have made. (What) they have made is only a magician's plot and the magician will not be successful wherever he goes
So the magicians were thrown bowing down, saying, "We believe in the Fosterer of Harun and Musa
He (Firawn) said, "You believe in him before I give you permission? He (Musa) is certainly a great (expert) among you all who has taught you the magic. So I will definitely cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides and I will definitely crucify you on the trunks of the palm trees, and you will definitely know which of us has more severe and more lasting punishment
They said, "We will never prefer you to what has come to us of the clear proofs and to Him Who initiated our creation. So decide whatever you (wish to) decide, you can decide only about the life of this world
We certainly believe in our Fosterer, (and hope) that He will protectively forgive us our faults and the magic to which you compelled us, and Allah is the Best and One Who remains for ever
Whoever comes to his Fosterer as a criminal, then for him, certainly there is hell, he will neither die therein nor live
And whoever comes to Him as a believer having done righteous works, then those are the persons for whom there are high ranks
gardens of everlasting bliss, beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein and that is the reward of him who purifies (himself). (R)
And We communicated to Musa that (you should) travel by night with My servants, then strike a dry path for them in the sea, neither fearing to be overtaken nor being afraid
Then Firawn followed them with his forces but there covered them from the flowing water, that which covered them (when the stationary sea started to flow)
So Firawn led his people astray and he did not guide (them a right)
O children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy and We made a promise with you on the right (hand) side of the Mount Toor and We sent down on you manna and quails
Eat from the good things which We have provided for you and do not transgress therein lest My anger come down upon you, and he on whom My anger comes down, he will indeed perish
And I am certainly Protectively Forgiving for him who repents and believes and does righteous work (and is) then guided
(It was asked), “And what has made you to hasten in advance of your people, O Musa?”
He said, “ They are close on my footsteps and I hastened to You my Fosterer, to please You.”
He said, "And We have tested your people after you (left them) and Samiri has misled them
So Musa returned to his people angry and (in) grief. He said, "O my people! did your Fosterer not promise you a good promise? Then, did the (time of) agreement appear long to you? Or did you intend that the anger of your Fosterer should come down upon you (and) therefore you went against your agreement made with me
They said, "We did not go against (our) agreement with you on our own accord but we were made to carry the burdens of the ornaments of the people, so we put them (in the fire) because Samiri had put (the suggestion) like this
Then he took out for them a body of a calf, it had a hollow sound, then he said, "This is your god and the god of Musa, but he forgot
Then could they not see, that it did not return to them (even) a word (in reply) and it had no control on harming or benefiting them? (R)
And Harun had indeed said to them earlier, "O my people! you are only being tested through it and your Fosterer is certainly the Beneficent (Allah), so follow me and obey my order
They said, "We will not give up sticking to its (worship) till Musa returns to us
He (Musa) said, "O Harun! what prevented you, when you saw them going astray
that you did not follow me, did you then disobey my order
He said, "O son of my mother! do not catch me by my beard nor by my head, I feared lest you should say: you have caused a division among the children of Israel and did not wait for my word
He said, "So what was your affair O Samiri
He said, "I saw that, which they did not see, so I took a handful from the footstep of the messenger then I threw it and thus did my soul incline me (to do)
He said, "Then go away, and in this life (it will) certainly (be incumbent) on you to say: do not touch me. And (this is) certainly a promise for you against which you can never go. And look at your god to whose (worship) you were sticking, we will definitely burn it, then we will definitely uproot it disintegrating it in the river
Your God is only Allah, other than Whom there is no god, (His) knowledge extends over everything
Thus do We narrate to you (some) of the news of what happened before. And We have given you a reminder from Us
one who turns away from it, then he will carry a burden on the day of resurrection
staying under it, and it will be an evil (burden) for them to carry on the day of resurrection
the day it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe), and We will gather the criminals blind on that day
whispering among themselves, ''You did not stay but (for) ten (days)
We know best that which they talk about, when the best of them in tradition (following sequence of events) will say, "You did not stay but (for) a day." (R)
And they ask you about the mountains, so say, "My Fosterer will uproot them (to result in) a disintegration
so that He will leave them as a leveled expanse
You will see neither any crookedness nor unevenness
On that day they will all follow the announcer, there will be no crookedness (in responding) to him, and voices will humble before the Beneficent (Allah), so that you will not hear anything except a faint sound
On that day mediation will not be profitable except of him whom the Beneficent (Allah) permits, and with whose word He is pleased
He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them but they cannot encompass it in(their) knowledge
And faces will humble before the Living, the Eternally Existing and he who carries (the burden of) injustice would indeed fail
And whoever does works of righteousness while he is a believer, then he will have neither the fear of injustice nor of getting lesser than what is due to him
And thus We have sent it down an Arabic Quran and We have repeated in it (some) of the threats that they may guard (against evil) or (that) it may serve them as a reminder
So Highly Exalted is Allah the Real King. And do not be in haste with the Quran before its communication to you is completed, and say, "My Fosterer! increase me in knowledge
And We had indeed made an agreement with Adam earlier but he forgot, and We did not find determination in him. (R)
And when We said to the angels, "Bow down to Adam," they (all) bowed down, except Iblis, he refused
Then We said, "O Adam! this is certainly an enemy to you and your wife, so let him not drive you both out of the garden so that you face distress
It is certainly (ordained) for you that you will neither be hungry therein nor naked
and you will neither be thirsty therein nor be exposed to sun's rays, (because of plenty of food, drinks, clothes and the pleasant environment)
But the devil whispered to him saying. "O Adam! shall I lead you to the tree of eternity and a kingdom that has no downfall
So they both ate from it, consequently their shame became manifest to them and they both began to cover themselves with the leaves of the garden, and Adam disobeyed his Fosterer therefore he went astray
Then his Fosterer chose him and turned to him (mercifully) and guided him
He said, "Go down from here both of you together, some of you (will be) enemies of others, but when guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, he will neither go astray nor face distress
And whoever turns away from My reminder, then his life will certainly be miserable and We will raise him blind on the day of resurrection
He will say, "My Fosterer! why did you raise me blind when I was one with sight (in the life of the world)
He will say, "Thus Our signs came to you but you forgot them, therefore in a similar manner, you are forgotten this day
And thus do We reward one who exceeds the limits and does not believe in the signs of his Fosterer and the punishment of the hereafter is more severe and more lasting
Then does not (this fact serve as) guidance for them: how many of the generations, in whose dwelling places they walk, have We destroyed before them? Certainly in that there are signs for possessors of sense. (R)
And had a statement not gone forth from your Fosterer and a term appointed, the (punishment) would have become inevitable (on them)
So be patient on what they say and glorify your Fosterer by praising Him before the rising of the sun and before its setting, and during hours of night (too) glorify (Him), and (also) at the two ends of the day, that you may be pleased
And do not stretch your eyes towards that with which We have made some classes of them to enjoy. (It is) a splendor of the life of this world that We may test them thereby, and the provision of your Fosterer is the best and more lasting
And enjoin worship (salat) on your people and be constant therein. We do not ask you for provision, We provide for you. And the consequence of guarding (against evil, is good)
And they say, "Why does he not bring to us a sign from his Fosterer?" Has a clear proof not come to them through that which was there in previous books
And had We destroyed them with punishment before (sending) him, they would have said, "Our Fosterer! before we were humbled and disgraced, why did you not send to us a messenger, so that we could have followed Your signs (orders).”
Say, "Everyone is waiting, so you (too) wait, and you will come to know who thecompanions of the balanced path are, and who is (rightly) guided
(The time for giving) an account of their deeds has come near for mankind yet they turn away in heedlessness
There does not come to them (anything) new from the reminder of their Fosterer but they hear it while playing
their hearts (being involved) in pastime. And those who are unjust talk in secret, "Is this (person something) other than a man like yourselves? Why do you then come to magic while you see?”
Say, "My Fosterer knows what is spoken in the sky and the earth and He is the Hearing, the Knowing
No ! they say, "Confused dreams, no, he forged it, no, he is a poet, so let him bring to us a sign like that which was sent through the earlier (prophets)
No city which We destroyed before them believed, so will they believe
And We sent before you only men, to whom We communicated, so ask people who remember if you do not know
And We did not make for them bodies which did not eat food, and they were not those who stayed (as immortals)
Then We fulfilled Our promise to them and delivered them and him whom We willed and We destroyed those who committed excesses
We have sent down to you the book in which (there is) a reminder (for) you, will you not then understand? (R)
And how many a town, which was unjust, did We destroy? And We produced after them other people
So when they felt Our might then they ran away from it
Do not run away but return to the enjoyment in which you were (engulfed) and your dwellings, that you may be questioned
They said, "Sorrowful is our state, we were certainly unjust
So, that call of theirs did not cease till We made them (as) reaped (corn), motionless
And We did not create the sky and earth and that which is between these two, for sport
Had We intended to take to pastime We could have taken it from near Us, if (at all) We were to do (it)
No ! We hurl the truth against the falsehood and it knocks out its brain and then it departs, and sorrowful is your state because of that which you describe
And whoever (or whatever) is in the skies and the earth is His and those who are with Him do not consider themselves great to serve Him nor/are they tired
They glorify (Him) night and day without slowing down
Or have they taken gods from the earth who will raise them (after their death)
Had there been (other) gods in the (skies and the earth), besides Allah, there would have been disorder, both (in the skies and the earth). So glorified be Allah, the Lord of the throne (of the universe). (He is high above) that which they describe
He cannot be questioned about what He does but they will be questioned
Or have they taken gods besides Allah? Say, "Bring your proof; this is a reminder for those with me and a reminder for those before me." But the majority of them does not know the truth, therefore they turn away
And We did not send any messenger before you but We communicated to him that, "There is no god except Me, so serve Me
And they say, “The Beneficent (Allah) has taken a son." Glorified be He. No, they are (His) honoured servants
They do not precede Him in speech and they act according to His command
He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them, and they cannot mediate except for him (with whom) He is pleased and they are afraid due to fear of Him
And whoever among them says, "I am god besides Him," then that (is the person) whom We will reward with hell, thus do We reward those who are unjust. (R)
Have not those who do not believe considered that the skies and the earth were both joined together then We tore both of them asunder ; and We made every living thing from water, will they not then believe
And We have made mountains in the earth lest it should shake with them and We have made in it wide ways that they may be guided
And We made the sky a guarded roof elevated and inclined (spherical), yet they turn away from its signs
And He it is Who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon, each one moves fast in an orbit
And We did not assign immortality to any man before you. Then if you die will they be immortal
Every soul tastes death. And We test you with evil and good trial (unfavourable and favourable circumstances), and you will be returned to Us
And when those who do not believe see you, they do not take you but as one to be mocked at (saying), "Is this the one who mentions (about) your gods?" And they, at the mention of the Beneficent (Allah), are rejecters
Man has been created of haste . I will show you My signs, so do not ask Me to hasten
And they say, "When will this promise (come to pass) if you are truthful
Had those who do not believe but known the time when they will not be able to stop the fire from their faces and from their backs and they will not be helped (they would not have asked you such a question)
No! it will come on them suddenly so as to confound them, and they will not be able to turn it away and they will not be given time
And messengers before you were mocked at, then that which they used to mock at, surrounded those of them who ridiculed. (R)
Say, "Who can guard you from the Beneficent (Allah) in the night and the day?" No! they are the persons who turn away from the remembrance of their Fosterer
Or do they have gods besides Us who can guard them? They cannot help themselves nor can they be defended from Us
No ! We gave provision to these and their fathers (too) till life lasted on them. Then do they not see that We give the earth its reduction from its borders? Will they then prevail
Say, "I warn you only according to the communication (I receive), but the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned
And (even) if the breath of the punishment of your Fosterer were to touch them, they would definitely say, "Sorrowful is our state, we were certainly unjust
And We will set up a just balance on the day of resurrection so that no soul will be dealt with unjustly (in any) thing, and if there be (even) the weight of a grain of a mustard seed, We will bring it (to account) and We are sufficient to take account
And We gave to Musa and Harun that which differentiates (between right and wrong) and a light and a reminder for those who guard (against evil)
who fear their Fosterer in secret (without having seen Him) and are (also) fearful of the hour of doom
And this is a blessed reminder which We have sent down. Will you then reject it? (R 4, P 16 ¼)
And earlier We gave Ibrahim (instructions to follow) the way (which was) right for him and We knew about him
when he said to his father and his people, "What are these images to whose (worship) you stick (devotedly)
They said, "We found our fathers worshipping them
He said, "Indeed you are and your fathers were in clear error
They said, "Have you (really) brought to us the truth or are you of those who are not serious
He said, "No! your Fosterer is the Fosterer of the skies and the earth Who initiated their creation and I am of those who bear witness to that
And by Allah, I have a definite plot for your idols after you go away turning your backs
So he broke them to pieces, except the big one among them, so that they might return to it
They said, "Who has done this to our gods? He is certainly one of the unjust
They said, "We heard a young man mentioning about them, they call him Ibrahim
They said, "Then bring him before the eyes of the people that they may bear witness
They said, "Did you do this to our gods, O Ibrahim
He said, "No! he did it, this big one among them, then ask them if they can speak
Then they turned to themselves and said, "Certainly you yourselves are the unjust
Then they were made to hang down their heads (saying), "You surely know that they do not speak
He said, "What! then do you worship besides Allah, that which can neither benefit you in anything nor harm you
Fie * on you and that which you worship besides Allah ! Have you then no sense?" * An expression of disgust
They said, "Burn him and (thereby) help your gods, if (at all) you are to do (anything)
We said, "O fire! be cool and (a source of) peace for Ibrahim
And they intended to set a plot for him but We made them greater losers
And We delivered him and Lut (and brought them safe) to the land (Syria) in which there was Our blessing for the worlds
And We granted him Ishaq and Yaqub in addition (as a grandson), and each of them We made righteous
And We made them leaders who guided by Our command and We communicated to them, "Do good deeds and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat)," and they were (only) Our servants
And Lut, We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and We delivered him from the town which practiced bad things, they were certainly an evil people, transgressors
And We admitted him into Our mercy, he was certainly of the righteous
And Nuh, when he prayed (to Us) earlier, We responded to him and saved him and his followers from the great distress
And We helped him against the people who denied Our signs. They were certainly an evil people so We drowned them all together
And Dawood and Sulaiman, when they both gave judgment concerning the field when the people's sheep pastured therein by night, and We did witness their judgment
So We made Sulaiman to understand it, and to each We gave wisdom and knowledge, and We compelled the mountains and the birds to glorify (Us) with Dawood, and it was We Who did (that)
And We taught him the (art of) making coats of mail for you that they might protect you in your wars. Will you then be grateful
And (We made) the violent wind to blow for Sulaiman by his command to the land which We had blessed, and We have knowledge of everything
And of the devils were those who dived for him and did works other than that, and We were the Custodians for them
And lyub, when he prayed to his Fosterer, "Harm has afflicted me and You are the Most Merciful of those who are merciful
So We responded to him and We removed that which was of harm to him, and We gave him his people (family) and with them (more) like them, a mercy from Us and a reminder for those who serve (worship)
And Ismael and Idris and Zul Kifl each one was of the patient ones
And We admitted them into Our mercy, they were certainly of the righteous ones
And Zan Nun when he went away in anger thinking that We have no power over him, then he prayed from the depths of darkness that, "There is no god but You, glory be to You, it was I (who) was of the unjust ones
So We responded to him and delivered him from the distress, and thus do We deliver the believers
And Zakariyya when he prayed to his Fosterer, "My Fosterer! do not leave me alone, though you are the Best of inheritors
So We responded to him and We granted to him Yahya by setting right for him his wife (who was barren). They were certainly those who were quick in doing good deeds and prayed to Us hoping and fearing and they were humble before Us
And she who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her from Our spirit and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds
This community of yours is certainly one community and I am your Fosterer so you all serve Me
And their (followers) divided their (religious) affair among themselves (becoming sects), each one will return to Us
So whoever does works of righteousness while he is a believer, then there will be no rejection of his striving and We will certainly record it for him
And there is a prohibition on (the people of) the town which We have destroyed, that they will not return
until when Yajooj and Majooj are opened (or are made to conquer) and they set (themselves) free (or fall) from every elevated place
And the true promise will come near, so as a consequence of this, the eyes of those who do not believe will stare ( in horror): "Sorrowful is our state, we were indeed heedless of this, no, we were the unjust ones
You and that which you worshipped besides Allah are certainly fuel of hell, you will be presented to it
Had these been gods they would not have been presented to the (hell) and each will stay in it
There will be the sound of blazing fire for them therein and therein they will not (be able to) hear
Those for whom the good has gone forth from Us, they will certainly be kept far away from it
They will not hear its slightest sound and they will stay in (such a state that they will have) what their souls will
The great horror will not grieve them, and the angels will I meet them (saying), "This is your day which you were promised.”
The day We will roll up the sky (by pulling together all that is in it), like the rolling up of the sheet for writings (in the form of a roll), as We began the first creation We will get it reproduced, a promise binding on Us, We will certainly fulfil it
And We had written in the book, after the reminder, that My righteous servants will inherit the earth
There is certainly a message in this for a people who serve Us
And We have not sent you but as a mercy for the worlds
Say, "It is communicated to me that the God of you all is only One God. Will you then submit (as Muslims)
But if they turn back then say, "I have announced (the message) to all of you equally, and I do not know whether that which you are promised is near or far
He certainly knows (that which is) manifest in speech and He knows that which you hide
And I do not know perhaps it may be a trial for you and a provision till a time
O mankind! fear your Fosterer. The quaking of the hour of doom is certainly a great thing
The day you will see it, every mother giving suck will forget that which she suckled (i.e her child), and every pregnant woman will lay down her burden, and you will see mankind intoxicated though they will not be intoxicated, but the punishment of Allah will be severe
And among mankind is he who disputes regarding Allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil
It is written down about him (devil): whoever turns to him for friendship, he will certainly mislead him and he will guide him to the punishment of the blazing fire
O mankind ! if you are in doubt about the resurrection, then We certainly created you from the soil, then from the sperm, then from that which clings and hangs like a leech, then from (a thing like) chewed flesh in proportion and out of proportion . (This description is given so) that We may make clear to you (the process of your birth). And We cause to stay in the wombs that which We will, till an appointed term, then We bring you out as infants, then (you grow) so as to reach your full strength (of maturity). And among you is he who is caused to die (young), and among you is he who is brought back to (that) worst part of life (i.e. old age), that (even) after having (had) knowledge, he does not know anything. And you see the earth barren, then when We send down water on it, it stirs and swells and puts forth every kind of beautiful growth
That is because, Allah is the Reality, and it is He Who gives life to the dead and He certainly has power over everything
And the hour of doom will come, there is no doubt about it, and Allah will certainly raise up those who are in the graves
And among mankind is he who disputes regarding Allah without knowledge and without guidance and without a book giving light
turning away in pride that he may mislead (people) from the way of Allah, for him is disgrace in this world and on the day of resurrection We will make him taste the punishment of burning
that is because of what your two hands have sent before and Allah is certainly not unjust to His servants. (R)
And among mankind is he who serves Allah (standing) on the verge, so that, if good befalls him he is satisfied with it but if a trial afflicts him he turns away his attention (from the service of Allah). He loses this world as well as the hereafter, that is a clear loss
Besides Allah he prays to that which neither harms him nor benefits him, that is going far astray
He prays to him whose harm is nearer than his benefit, evil is the guardian and evil is the friend
Allah will certainly admit those who believe and do righteous works into gardens beneath which rivers flow. Allah certainly does what He intends
One who thinks that Allah will not help him (Muhammed) in this world and the hereafter let him stretch (himself) through (some) means to the sky, then let him cut off (the means) then let him see whether this plot of his removes that which angers him
And thus We have sent down the (Quran containing) clear signs, and Allah certainly guides whom He intends to
Those who believe and those who are Jews and the Sabaeans and the Christians and the Magians and those who associate partners (with Allah), Allah will certainly judge between them on the day of resurrection, Allah is certainly a Witness over everything
Did you not consider that whoever is in the skies and whoever is in the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars and the mountains and the trees and the moving creatures and many among mankind, certainly bow down to Allah (by obeying Him), and there are many on whom the punishment is due, and one whom Allah disgraces there is no one to give him honour, Allah certainly does what He wills
These two disputants dispute regarding their Fosterer. So ( as for) those who do not believe, garments will be cut for them from fire (and) boiling water will be poured over their heads
whereby that which is there in their stomachs and (their) skins will be melted
and for them are whips of iron
whenever they will intend to go out from it due to the distress, they will be returned into it, and (it will be said), "Taste the punishment of burning
Allah will certainly admit those who believe and do righteous works into gardens beneath which rivers flow, they will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold (and) pearls and their garments therein will be of silk
And they are guided to (that which is) pleasingly good of (all) speech and they are guided to the path of the Praised One
Those who do not believe and turn away (people) from the way of Allah and the Sacred Mosque which We have made equal for (all) mankind, for one who resides therein and for the visitor, and whoever has the intention of perversion (and of doing) injustice therein, We will certainly make him taste a painful punishment
And (remember) when We had assigned to Ibrahim the place of the house (Kaaba and ordered) that, you do not associate with Me anything (as partner), and clean My house for those who walk around (it) and stand and bow down prostrating (in worship)
and announce among mankind about the Hajj, they will respond to you (by) coming on foot and on every lean/ hidden (means of travel), they will come from every latitude and longitude
that they may witness benefits for them, and mention the name of Allah during the known days on that which He has provided to them of the herbivorous cattle, then eat from it and feed the distressed poor
Then let them complete the rites and let them fulfill their vows and let them go round the ancient house (Kaaba)
(let it be like) that. And whoever respects the sacred things of Allah, it is better for him with his Fosterer. And the cattle are made lawful to you except that which has been read to you. So avoid the uncleanliness of the idols and avoid false speech
being upright for Allah without associating partners with Him. And whoever associates partners with Allah, it is as if he has fallen from the sky, then the birds snatch him away or the wind drops him in a far off place
(It is like) that. And whoever respects the symbols of Allah, then certainly this (respect) is due to restraining the hearts (from evil)
There are benefits for you in them till an appointed term, then their place of sacrifice is near the ancient house (the Kaaba)
And for every community We have appointed rites of sacrifice that they may mention the name of Allah on that which He has provided them of the herbivorous cattle. And your God is One God therefore submit to Him and convey the good news to those who humble themselves, themselves
who fear in their hearts when Allah is mentioned and who are patient on that which afflicts them and who establish worship (salat) and spend from that which We have provided them
And the camels for sacrifice, We have made (them) among symbols of Allah for you, there is good for you in them. So mention the name of Allah (as) they line up (for sacrifice), then when they fall down on their sides eat from them and feed the one who is content and the one who begs. Thus We have subjected them to you that you may be grateful
Neither their flesh nor their blood reaches Allah, but it is (the feeling of His) fear in you that reaches Him. Thus He has subjected them to you that you may regard Allah Great for having guided you, and convey the good news to the doers of good
Allah will certainly repel (the enemies) from the believers. Allah certainly does not love one who is a betrayer, ungrateful. (R 5, P 16 ¾)
Permission (to fight) is granted to those, against whom people fight, because they have certainly been dealt with unjustly, and Allah certainly has the power over helping those
who were driven out of their houses unjustly, only because they said, "Our Fosterer is Allah." And had Allah not repelled some people by others (then) cloisters and churches and synagogues and mosques wherein Allah's name is remembered much, would have surely been pulled down. And Allah will definitely help him who helps Him, Allah is certainly Strong, Mighty
Those who, if We establish them in the earth, would establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and enjoin that which is recognized (as good) and forbid that which is not recognized (as good). And it is for Allah (to decide) the results of affairs
And if they deny you, then before them, the people of Nuh and Aad and Samood had also denied
along with the people of Ibrahim and people of Lut
and the inhabitants of Midian. And Musa was also denied; so I gave to the infidels time (for amending themselves) then caught them. Then how was My rejection (of them)
So how many a town did We destroy while it was unjust, so it fell down on its roofs with (many a) deserted well and lofty palace reduced in size
Then did they not travel in the earth so as to have hearts (minds) with which they could understand or ears with which they could hear? Then certainly, the eyes are not blind but the hearts, that are in the bosoms, are blind
And they ask you to hasten on the punishment and Allah never goes against His promise, and a day with your Fosterer is certainly like a thousand years of what you number
And how many a town is there to which I gave time (for amendment) while it was unjust, then I caught it and towards Me is the destination
Say, "O mankind! I am a clear warner to you
So for those who believe and do righteous works, there is protective forgiveness and an honoured provision
And those who strive against Our signs to defeat (them), those are the inhabitants of the hell fire
And We did not send before you, any messenger or prophet, but when he desired (something) the devil put into his desire (some evil, as he normally does with human beings). Therefore Allah (first) wipes off that which the devil puts (into the desires of messengers and prophets and) then Allah establishes His signs (Divine communication), Allah is Knowing, Wise
that He may make that which the devil puts in, a temptation for those in whose hearts is a disease and those whose hearts are hardened (and not for the messengers and prophets), and the unjust are certainly in deep opposition
and that those who are given knowledge may know that the (Quran) is certainly the truth from your Fosterer (which has not been polluted in any way) so that they may believe therein and their hearts may humbly submit to Him. And Allah certainly guides those who believe, to the straight path
And those who do not believe will not cease to be in doubt about it, till the hour of doom suddenly comes upon them or the punishment of the barren day comes upon them
The kingdom on that day will be Allah's, He will judge between them. So those who believed and did righteous works will be in gardens of bliss
And those who did not believe and denied Our signs, then for them there will be a disgraceful punishment
And those who migrated in the way of Allah then were killed or died, Allah will definitely provide them a good provision and Allah is certainly the Best of providers
He will definitely make them enter an entry, with which they will be pleased and Allah is certainly Knowing, Clement (Kind)
(It will be like) that. And one who retaliates with the like of that with which he was made to suffer, then (if) he is oppressed, Allah will definitely help him. Allah is certainly Pardoning, Protectively Forgiving
That is because Allah makes the night to enter into the day and He makes the day to enter into the night and Allah is certainly Hearing, Seeing
That is because Allah is the Reality and that which they call upon besides Him, that is falsehood and because Allah, He is the High, the Great
Did you not see that Allah sends down water from the sky so the earth becomes green? Allah is certainly Subtilely Informed
Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is His, and Allah is certainly the Independent, the Praised
Did you not consider that Allah has subjected to your service that which is in the earth, and the ships sailing in the sea by His command, and He withholds the sky from falling on the earth, (the sky cannot fall down) without His permission? Allah is certainly full of pity and Merciful to mankind
And He it is Who gave you life, then He will cause you to die, then He will (again) make you alive. Man is certainly ungrateful
For every community We have appointed devotional rites which they are toper form, so let them not dispute with you about the affair, and invite (them) towards your Fosterer, you are certainly on right guidance
And if they dispute with you then say, "Allah knows best about that which you all do
Allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning that wherein you used to differ
Did you not know that Allah knows that which is in the sky and the earth, that is certainly in a record, that is certainly easy for Allah
And they serve (worship) besides Allah, that for which He has not sent down any authority, and that about which they have no knowledge. And for those who are unjust there will be no helpers
And when Our clear signs are read to them you can recognize rejection in the faces of those who do not believe, (as if) they are about to attack those who read Our signs to them. Say, "Shall I inform you of (something) worse than that? The fire ! Allah has promised it for those who do not believe, and it is an evil destination
O mankind ! a similitude is set forth, so listen to it: those whom you pray to, besides Allah, certainly cannot create a fly (even) if they all get together for it, and if the fly snatches away something from them they cannot (even) take it back from it, weak are the seeker and the sought
They have not estimated Allah with the estimation that is due to Him, Allah is certainly Strong, Mighty
Allah chooses messengers from among the angels and (also) from among mankind, Allah is certainly Hearing, Seeing
He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them, and all affairs are returned to Allah
O you who believe ! bow down and prostrate and serve (worship) your Fosterer and do good that you may be successful
And strive in (the cause of) Allah with the striving that is due to His (cause). He has chosen you and He has not made any difficulty for you in religion, the religious dictates of your father Ibrahim, He had named you Muslims before and in this (too), that the messenger may be a witness over you ( by keeping an eye on you all) and you may be witnesses over mankind (by keeping an eye on them). So establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and hold fast to Allah. He is your Guardian and an Excellent Guardian and Excellent Helper
And strive in (the cause of) Allah with the striving that is due to His (cause). He has chosen you and He has not made any difficulty for you in religion, the religious dictates of your father Ibrahim, He had named you Muslims before and in this (too), that the messenger may be a witness over you ( by keeping an eye on you all) and you may be witnesses over mankind (by keeping an eye on them). So establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and hold fast to Allah. He is your Guardian and an Excellent Guardian and Excellent Helper
Successful indeed are the believers
Those who are humble during their worship (salat)
and those who keep away from what is vain
and those who are active in giving charity (zakat)
and those who guard their private parts
except from their mates or those whom their right hands possess, then (in their case) they are certainly free of blame
but whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the persons who transgress
and those who are keepers of their trusts and their agreements
and those who guard their worship (salat)
Those are the inheritors
who will inherit paradise, they will stay in it
And We have indeed created man from something taken out from clay
Then We made it a sperm in a settling place
then We proportioned the sperm (into) that which clings and hangs like a leech, then We proportioned that which clings and hangs like a leech (into a thing like) chewed flesh, then We proportioned (the thing like) chewed flesh (into) bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, then We developed him in another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of Proportioners
Then after that you certainly die
Then on the day of resurrection you will certainly be raised
And We have created seven paths above you, and We are not heedless of the creation
And We send down water from the sky with a (set) programme, then We settle it in the earth, and We have the power on its removal
And from it We produce gardens of date palms and grapes for you, there are many fruits for you in them and you eat from them
and the (olive) tree that springs out from Mount Sinai, growing with oil (in it) and a curry for those who eat
And there is certainly a lesson for you in the cattle, We make you to drink from that which is in their stomachs and there are many benefits for you in them and (some) of them you eat
and on them and on the ships you are carried. (R)
And We had sent Nuh to his people so he said, "O my people! serve (worship) Allah, there is no god for you other than Him. Will you not then guard (against the evil of worshipping others)
So the leaders of those who did not believe from among his people said, "He is no more than a man like yourselves, he intends to achieve superiority over you, and had Allah willed He would have sent down angels, We have not heard this among our ancient forefathers
He is nothing but a man who is possessed by jinn, so bear with him till (some) time
He said, "My Fosterer! help me because they deny me
So We communicated to him, "Make the ship before Our eyes and (according to) Our communication. Then when Our commandment comes and the water gushes forth from (the reservoir in) the valley, make each pair (consisting) of two, to enter the (ship) along with your people, except him among them against whom the word has already gone forth, and do not speak to me regarding those who are unjust, they will certainly be drowned
Then when you are balanced on the ship, you and those with you, then say: "Praise is due only for Allah Who delivered us from the unjust people
And say, "My Fosterer! make me alight a blessed alighting and You are the Best of those who cause to alight
There are certainly signs in that, and We are ever testing (people)
Then after them We produced another generation
then We sent among them a messenger from among themselves (saying), "Serve Allah, there is no god for you other than Him. Will you not then guard (against the evil of worshipping others)
And the leaders of his people who did not believe and denied the meeting of the hereafter and whom We had made to enjoy in the life of the world said, “This is no more than a man like yourselves, he eats from that from which you eat and he drinks from that which you drink
And if you obey a man like yourselves, then you will certainly be of the losers
Does he promise you, that when you are dead and you become (part of the) soil and bones, that you will be brought out (alive again)
Far, far is that which you are promised
There is nothing except our life of this world, we die and we live and we will not be of those who are raised (after death)
He is nothing but a man who has forged a lie against Allah and we are not of those who believe in him
He said, "My Fosterer! help me because they deny me
He said, "In a little while they will definitely become regretters
So a loud cry took hold of them in reality, then We made them rubbish, so away with the unjust people
Then after them We produced other generations
No community can advance its term nor can it postpone it
Then We sent Our messengers one after another. Whenever its messenger came to a community, it denied him, so We made some of them to follow others and We made them stories, so away with the people who do not believe
Then We sent Musa and his brother Harun with Our signs and clear authority
to Firawn and the leaders of his (people), but they considered themselves great and they were a transgressing people
So they said, "Shall we believe in two men like us while (the people) of their community are our servants
So they denied them, therefore they became of those who were destroyed
And We gave Musa the book that they may be guided
And We made the son of Maryam and his mother a sign; and for shelter We took them to a high place, with springs, (which was) meant for staying
O you messengers! eat from the good things and do righteous work, I certainly know about that which you do
And this community of yours is certainly a single community and I am your Fosterer so fear Me
But they (their followers) divided their (religious) affairs among themselves (becoming different) sects, each party being happy with that which was with it
So leave them in their confused ignorance till a time
Do they think that by Our helping them with wealth and sons
We are hastening good things for them? No! they do not perceive
Those who are afraid due to the fear of their Fosterer
and those who believe in the signs of their Fosterer
and those who do not associate partners with their Fosterer
and those who give that which they give, with their hearts full of fear because they have to return to their Fosterer
those are the persons who certainly hasten in good things and they are foremost in them
And We do not task a soul except to its capacity. And with Us is a record which speaks the truth, and they will not be dealt with unjustly
No ! their hearts are in a confused ignorance about this, and theirs are works besides that, which they (go on) doing
until when We afflict those who are well off among them with punishment, then they will cry for help
Do not cry for help this day, you will certainly not be helped by Us
My signs were indeed read to you but you used to turn back on your heels
considering yourselves great with respect to them, getting engaged in story telling and shameful talk
Do they not reflect on the word or has there come to them (something) which had not come to their ancient forefathers
Or are they not recognizing their messenger, (and) therefore they are rejecting him
Or do they say he is possessed by jinn? No! he has come to them with the truth but most of them are haters of truth
And had the truth followed their desires, then the skies and the earth and whoever (whatever) is therein would have surely been in disorder. No! We have given to them their reminder but they turn away from their reminder
Or do you ask them for a recompense (for preaching)? Then the recompense of your Fosterer is the best and He is the Best of those who provide
And you are certainly inviting them to the straight path
but those who do not believe in the hereafter, they are certainly deviating from the path
And (even) if We show mercy to them and remove the harm with which they are afflicted, they would still persist blindly wandering on in their rebellion
And We had caught them in the punishment but (even then) they do not submit themselves to their Fosterer, and they do not humble themselves
until when We open on them the door of severe punishment, then they will be in despair therein. (R)
And He it is Who has produced for you the ears and the eyes and the hearts (but) the gratitude which you show is (comparatively) less
And He it is Who has multiplied (and spread) you in the earth and to Him you will be gathered
And He it is Who gives life and causes death and the alternation of the night and the day is due to Him. Will you not then understand
No ! they say the like of that which the ancients said
They say, "What! when we are dead and become (part of the) soil and bones, will we really be raised
We are promised this, we and our forefathers earlier, these are nothing but stories of the ancient
Say, "Whose is the earth and whoever is therein, if you know
They will say, "Allah's." Say, "Will you not then be mindful
Say, "Whose is the Fostering of the seven skies (higher levels) and the Lordship of the great throne (of the universe)
They will say, "Allah's." Say, "Will you not then guard (against evil)
Say, "Who is it in Whose hand is the control of everything and He protects and there is no (one who can) protect against Him, if you know
They will say, "(This is also in) Allah's (control)." Say, “Then how are you under the influence of magic?”
No ! We have brought to them the truth but they are certainly liars
Allah has not taken any son nor is there any (other) god with Him, (had there been two or more gods, then) in that case, each god would have taken away that which he had created and some would have dominated over others, glorified be Allah above that which they describe
Knower of the unseen and the seen and He is Highly Exalted above that which they associate as partners (with Him)
Say, "My Fosterer! if you show me that which they are promised
my Fosterer! then do not make me to be among the unjust people
And We are certainly able to show you that which We have promised them
Repel evil with that which is the best, We know best about that which they describe
And say, "My Fosterer! I seek Your protection from the suggestions of the devils
and I seek Your protection, my Fosterer! lest they be present with me
(Some people continue to do evil) until when death comes to one of them (then) he says. "My Fosterer! send me back
that I may set right in (the world, all wrongs) which I have left behind." By no means! It is (only) a sentence which he says. And behind them is a barrier till the day they are raised
Then when it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe) then there will be no relationships between them on that day and (therefore) they will not (be able to) demand from one another
Then those whose weight (of good) is heavy, those are the successful persons
And those whose weight (of good) is light, those are the persons who (have put) themselves (in) loss, they will stay in hell
The fire will burn their faces, and (due to severe suffering), they will have therein, an expression of torture with their lips apart
Were not My signs read to you? But you used to deny them
They will say, "Our Fosterer! our misfortune prevailed over us and we became a misguided people
Our Fosterer ! take us out of this, if we again return (to evil) then we will certainly be unjust
He will say, "Go away into it and do not speak to Me
There was a party from among My servants who said: Our Fosterer ! we believe, so protectively forgive us and have mercy on us and you are the Best of those who are merciful
But you took them as a ridicule to the extent that they made you forget (even) My remembrance and you used to laugh at (some) of them
I have rewarded them this day because they were patient, they are certainly the achievers (of success)
He will say, "How long did you stay in the earth, counting in years
They will say, "We stayed for a day or part of a day but ask those who keep the account
He will say, "You did not stay but a little, had you but known
Did you then think that We created you without any purpose and that you will not be returned to Us
So Highly Exalted is Allah the Real King, there is no god except Him, Lord of the honoured throne (of the universe)
And he who prays to another (presumed) god along with Allah, having no proof with him of it (being a god), then (the responsibility of taking) his account (rests) only on Allah. The infidels will certainly not be successful
And say, "My Fosterer! protectively forgive and have mercy and You are the Best of those who are merciful
A chapter which We have sent down, and which We have ordained, and through which We have sent down clear signs, that you may be mindful
The adulteress and the adulterer, flog each of them (with) hundred stripes, and pity for them should not withhold you in (implementing) the law of Allah if you believe in Allah and the period hereafter, and let a party of believers witness their punishment
The adulterer shall not marry any but an adulteress or a polytheist (woman). And the adulteress, none shall marry her except an adulterer or a polytheist, and that is forbidden to the believers
And those who accuse chaste women then do not bring four witnesses, flog them (with) eighty stripes and do not accept their testimony forever, and those are the persons who exceed the limits
except those who repent after that and mend (themselves),then Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And those who accuse their wives and have no witnesses except themselves, then the testimony of one of them (maybe accepted if) he bears witness (by swearing) four times by Allah that he is certainly of those who are truthful
and the fifth (time) that Allah's curse be on him if he is of those who lie
And it shall turn off the punishment from her if she testifies (and) bears witness (by swearing) four times by Allah that he is certainly of those who lie
and the fifth (time), that Allah's anger be upon her if he is of those who are truthful
And had the grace of Allah not been on you with His mercy, and that Allah is the Accepter of repentance, Wise, (then you would have been at a loss). (R)
Those who came up with the devised falsehood are certainly a group from among you. Do not think that it is harmful for you, no, it is good for you. For every man among them, is that which he has earned of the sin, and he among them who is responsible to a greater extent (regarding devising the falsehood), for him there is a great punishment
Why did the believing men and the believing women, on hearing the (devised falsehood), not have good thoughts in their souls (minds) and say, "This is clearly a devised falsehood
Why did they not come up with four witnesses over it (if they were speaking the truth)? So when they did not come with witnesses, then they are the liars before Allah
And had the grace of Allah not been on you with His mercy in this world and the hereafter, a great punishment would (have afflicted you because of the talk you indulged in)
when you were speaking (about) it with your tongues and saying with your mouths that about which you had no knowledge and you thought it to be an easy (matter) but with Allah it was great
And when you heard it, why did you not say, "It is not (suitable) for us to talk about this, glory be to You (Allah), this is a great false charge
Allah admonishes you that you should never return to the like of it, if you are believers
And Allah makes clear to you the signs and Allah is Knowing, Wise
For those who love that indecent things should spread among those who believe, there will certainly be a painful punishment in this world and the hereafter, and Allah knows while you do not know
And had the grace of Allah not been on you with His mercy, and that Allah is full of pity, Merciful, (then you would have been at a loss). (R 2, P 17 ½)
O you who believe ! do not follow the footsteps of the devil, and whoever follows the footsteps of the devil, then he will certainly enjoin indecency and that which is not recognized (as good), and had the grace of Allah not been on you with His mercy, not (even) one of you would have ever been pure, but Allah purifies whom He wills and Allah is Hearing, Knowing. , but Allah purifies whom He wills and Allah is Hearing, Knowing
And do not let those of you who possess grace and (financial) capability (to help), swear not to give to relatives and to the poor and the migrants in the way of Allah, and let them pardon and overlook. Do you not like that Allah should (also) protectively forgive you? And Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Those who accuse chaste innocent believing women, they are certainly cursed in this world and the hereafter and for them there will be a great punishment (on)
the day their tongues and their hands and their feet will bear witness against them as to that which they used to do
On that day Allah will pay in full their due reward and they will come to know that Allah is the Manifest Truth
Bad women are for bad men and bad men are for bad women, and good women are for good men and good men are for good women, they are free from that which they say. For them is protective forgiveness and an honourable provision. (R)
O you who believe! do not enter houses other than your own houses until you have asked for permission and greeted by invoking peace on the people living in them, that is better for you that you may be mindful
And if you do not find anyone therein then do not enter them until permission is given to you, and if it is said to you, "Go back," then go back, that is purer for you, and Allah is the Knower of that which you do
There is no sin on you if you enter non residential buildings wherein your provision (is stored), and Allah knows that which you manifest and that which you hide
Say to the believing men that they should keep their looks down and guard their private parts, that is purer for them. Allah is certainly informed of that which they do
And say to the believing women that they should keep their looks down and guard their private parts, and that they should not let their beauty be exposed, except that which appears thereof, and that they should draw their head covering over their bosoms and not let their beauty be exposed (by removing their head covering), except before their husbands or their fathers or fathers of their husbands or their sons or their husband's sons (through other wives) or their brothers or their brothers' sons or their sisters' sons or their women or those whom their right hands possess (slave girls) or male servants not having need (of women) or children who have no knowledge of hidden parts of women, and they should not strike their feet so as to make known that which is hidden of their beauty. And turn to Allah all together, O believers! that you may be made successful
And arrange for the marriage of those among you who are single and the righteous among your male and female slaves (servants). If they are in poverty Allah will enrich them out of His grace and Allah is Omnipresent (Ample-giving), Knowing
And let those who do not find the means to marry, restrain (themselves by keeping chaste), till Allah enriches them out of His grace. And from among those whom your right hands possess (slaves), those who seek a written (declaration from you for freeing themselves by paying you some money), then write it for them if you know any good in them and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution when they intend to be chaste, in order to seek the apparent good of the life of this world, and whoever compels them, then after their being compelled, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And We have sent down to you clear signs and the example of those who have passed away before you and an admonition for those who guard (against evil). (R)
Allah is the light of the skies and the earth. The likeness of His light is like an enclosure with one opening in which there is a lamp, the lamp is in a glass, the glass is as if it were a brilliant shining planet,(the lamp) is lit from a blessed olive tree, neither eastern nor western, whose oil is almost inflammable although fire has not (even) touched it, light upon light, Allah guides to His light whom He wills and Allah sets forth similitude’s for mankind and Allah is the Knower of everything
(His light is) in houses which Allah has ordered to be elevated and in which His name is remembered, He is glorified therein in the mornings and the evenings
(by) men whom neither commerce nor trade diverts from the remembrance of Allah and the establishment of worship (salat) and giving of charity (zakat), they fear the day on which the hearts and the eyes will be overturned
(and hope) that Allah will reward them with (something) better than that which they did and increase their (reward) out of His grace; and Allah provides without measure to whom He wills
And (as for) those who do not believe, their deeds will be like a mirage in the desert, which the thirsty person supposes to be water until when he comes to it and finds it to be nothing, and finds Allah with him (to take his account of deeds), so He pays in full to him that which is due to him and Allah is Quick in (settling) the account
Or like darkness in the deep sea, there covers him a wave, above which is another wave above which is a cloud, (layers of) darkness one above another, when he takes out his hand he is almost unable to see it; and he for whom Allah does not assign light, for him then, there is no light. (R)
Did you not consider that Allah is He Whom do glorify all who are in the skies and the earth and the birds (too) with wings spread out? Each one knows its worship (method of submission for close association with Allah) and its glorification (method of being occupied obeying Allah's orders). And Allah is the Knower of that which they do. obeying Allah's orders). And Allah is the Knower of that which they do
And Allah's is the kingdom of the skies and the earth and towards Allah is the destination
Did you not consider that (it is) Allah (Who) causes the driving of the clouds then the unification between them, then He makes them a heap, so you see the rain coming out of the spaces in between them, and He causes (the rain) to be sent down from the sky, from the mountainous volumes therein of coolness , then He causes it to fall on whom He wills and turns it away from whom He wills, the flash of His lightning almost takes away the sights
Allah causes the oscillation of the night and the day, in that there is certainly a lesson for those who have insight
And Allah created every moving creature from water, so among them is one that moves on its stomach and among them is one that walks on its two feet and among them is one that walks on four (legs). Allah creates what He wills, Allah certainly has power over everything
We have indeed sent down clear signs, and Allah guides whom He wills to the straight path
And they say, "We believe in Allah and in the messenger and we will obey," then a party from among them turns away after that (commitment), and those are not with the believers
And when they are invited towards Allah and His messenger that he may judge between them, then a party from among them turns away
And if the right (that is due to them) is on their side, they come to him being fast in obedience
Is there a disease in their hearts or are they in doubt or do they fear that Allah and His messenger will act with prejudice against them, no, they themselves are the unjust
The statement of the believers, when they are invited towards Allah and His messenger that He may judge between them, is only that they say, "We have heard and we obey," and those are the successful persons
And one who obeys Allah and His messenger and fears Allah being careful of Him, then those are the persons who are achievers (of success)
And they swear by Allah their strongest oaths, that if you command them they will definitely go out (to fight in the cause of Allah). Say, “Do not swear, recognized obedience (is required of you), Allah is certainly informed of that which you do
Say, "Obey Allah and obey the messenger, but if you turn away, then on him (the messenger, is the responsibility of) that which he is to bear and on you (is the responsibility of) that which you are to bear. And if you obey him you will be guided, and there is no other responsibility on the messenger except clear conveyance (of the message)
Allah has promised those of you who believe and do righteous works that He will definitely make them successors (rulers) in the earth like those before them whom He had made successors, and He will definitely establish for them their religion which He has chosen for them; and after their fear, He will definitely change for them their (condition and grant them) peace. They will serve Me, not associating anything with Me, and whoever is ungrateful after that then those are the persons who are transgressors
And establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and obey the messenger so that you may be dealt with mercifully
Do not think that those who do not believe will be defeaters in the earth when their settling place is the fire, and it is an evil destination. (R)
O you who believe! let those whom your right hands possess (slaves/servants) and those among you who have not reached the age of puberty seek your permission three times: Before the worship (salat) of dawn, and at the time when you put off your clothes due to afternoon heat, and after the worship (salat) of night. (These are the) three times of privacy for you. There is no sin on you or on them beyond (these) times if they move about you, some (attending) on others. Thus Allah makes clear to you the signs and Allah is Knowing, Wise
And when the children among you attain the age of puberty, let them (also) seek permission like those before them (had) sought permission. Thus Allah makes clear to you His signs and Allah is Knowing, Wise
And the elderly among the women who have no hope of marriage, there is no sin on them if they put off their (extra) clothes without exposure of (the things of their) beauty, but if they restrain (themselves even from this) it is better for them, and Allah is Hearing, Knowing
There is no blame on the blind nor is there blame on the lame nor is there blame on the sick nor on yourselves that you eat from your own houses or houses of your fathers or houses of your mothers or houses of your brothers or houses of your sisters or houses of your father's brothers or houses of your father's sisters or houses of your mothers' brothers or houses of your mothers' sisters or (from places) the keys of which are in your control or (from) your friend. There is no sin on you if you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses then greet (by invoking peace) among yourselves, a blessed pleasingly good greeting from Allah. Thus Allah makes clear to you the signs that you may understand. (R)
Only those are believers who believe in Allah and His messenger and when they are with him on an affair of common interest, they do not go away until they have asked for his permission. Those who ask for your permission, those are certainly the persons who believe in Allah and His messenger, so when they ask for your permission for some affair of theirs, permit those of them whom you will, and seek protective forgiveness for them from Allah. Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful. Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Do not make the invitation of the messenger to you (for religious works) like your invitation of one another. Allah indeed knows those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. Let those who go against his order beware, lest a trial afflict them or they be afflicted with a painful punishment
Beware! whatever is in the skies and the earth is certainly Allah's. He indeed knows that on which you are, and the day they are returned to Him, He will inform them about that which they did, and Allah is the Knower of everything. (R)
Blessed is He Who sent down on His servant the distinction (between right and wrong), that he may be a warner for the worlds
He, Whose is the kingdom of the skies and the earth. And He has not taken (anyone as) a son, and He has no partner in the kingdom. And He created everything then programmed for it a programme
And they have taken gods besides Him who do not create anything while they themselves are created, and they do not control (even) for themselves any harm or profit nor do they control death nor life, nor (do they have the power of) raising the dead (to life)
And those who do not believe say, "This is nothing but a lie which he has forged and other people have helped him at it." Thus they have come up with injustice and falsehood
And they say, "Stories of the ancient, which he has got written down as they are dictated to him morning and evening
Say, "He Who knows the secrets of the skies and the earth has sent it down. He is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And they say, "What is (wrong with) this messenger, he eats food and walks in the markets? Why has not an angel been sent down to him so that he could be a warner along with him
Or (why has not) a treasure been thrown down to him or (why is there no) garden for him from which he could eat?" And those who are unjust say, "You follow none but a man under the influence of magic
See how they set forth similitude’s for you. Thus they have gone astray, therefore they will not be able to find the way
Blessed is He, Who, if He wills, can make for you (something) better than that: Gardens beneath which rivers flow, and make for you palaces
No, they deny the hour of doom, and We have prepared a blazing fire for him who denies the hour of doom
When it sees them from a far off place, they will hear its fury and the sound of blazing fire
And when they are thrown into a narrow place thereof, linked together, there they will pray for destruction
(It will be said), "This day do not pray for a single destruction but pray for many destructions
Say, "Is that better or the garden (meant) for staying, which is promised to those who guard (against evil)?" It is a reward for them as well as a destination
They will stay (and) have therein, what they will for. It is a promise of your Fosterer which should be asked for
And the day He will gather them and (all) that they served (worshipped) besides Allah, then He will say, "Was it you who misled these servants of Mine or they themselves went astray from the way
They will say, "Glory be to you! it was not for us to accept those turning to us, besides You, but You made them and their fathers enjoy to the extent that they forgot the reminder and (thus) became a lost people
(It will be said), "So they have denied you regarding that which you say," then you will neither be able to turn away (the punishment) nor (will you get any) help, and whoever among you is unjust, We will make him taste a great punishment
And We had not sent any messengers before you, but they ate food and walked in the markets. And We have made some of you a trial for others. Will you (bear with) patience? And your Fosterer is Seeing. (R 2, P)
And those who do not hope to meet Us say, "Why have not angels been sent down on us or (why) do we not see our Fosterer?" They are indeed proud of themselves and they revolted with a great revolt
The day they will see the angels, on that day it will not be a good news for the criminals, and they will say, "(May we be) prevented (from that through some) prevention
And We will turn to the work which they did, then We will make it as scattered dust
On that day the place/time of stay of the inhabitants of the garden will be good, and their resting place the best
And on that day the sky will be split with the clouds (coverings) and the angels will be sent down, descending
The kingdom on that day, as a right, will be of the Beneficent (Allah), and the day will be difficult for the infidels
And on that day the unjust will bite his hands saying, "I wish I had taken a way with the messenger
O sorrowful is my state, I wish I had not taken such a one as a friend
he has misled me from the reminder after it had come to me, and the devil is a traitor for man
And the messenger says, "O my Fosterer ! my people have certainly taken this Quran as a forsaken thing
And thus did We make for every prophet, an enemy from among the criminals, and your Fosterer is sufficient as a Guide and a Helper
And those who do not believe say, "Why has not the whole Quran been sent down on him all at once?" Thus (We have not sent it down all at once) that We may make your heart firm through it, and (therefore) We have caused the Quran to be recited to you gradually (in portions, after) intervals
And they do not come to you with any similitude (question or problem) but We give you the correct (answer) with the best explanation
Those who will be gathered towards hell on their faces, those will be in an evil place and away from the way
And We gave the book to Musa and We made his brother Harun responsible with him
Then We said, "Both of you go to the people who have denied Our signs." Then We destroyed them (with a total) destruction
And the people of Nuh, when they denied the messengers, We drowned them and We made them a sign for mankind. And We have prepared for those who are unjust, a painful punishment
and (also for) Aad and Samood and the inhabitants of the Rass and many generations between them
And for everyone We had set forth examples and everyone We destroyed (with a total) destruction
And indeed they have passed by the town on which was rained an evil rain, did they not then see it? No, they do not hope to be raised (after death)
And when they see you, they do not take you for anything but mockery (saying), "Is this the one whom Allah has raised as a messenger
He would have almost misled us from our gods had we not patiently adhered to them. And they will know when they" see the punishment, who is more astray from the way
Have you seen him who takes his desire (as) his god, (he who follows only his desire and nothing else)? Then will you be a trustee over him
Or do you think that the majority of them hears or understands? They are nothing but like cattle, no, they are more astray from the way
Did you not consider (the work of) your Fosterer, how He stretches the shade (which ultimately ends in night)? And had He willed he could have made it stationary. Then We have made the sun its guide
Then We draw it towards Ourselves, an easy in drawing
And He it is Who has made the night a covering for you and the sleep a (source of) rest and He has made the day for rising up again
And He it is Who sends the winds (giving) good news before His mercy, and We send down from the sky clean water
that We may give life through it to a dead land and We make many cattle and human beings, whom We created, to drink it
And We have repeated it among them that they may be mindful, but the majority of mankind refuses (everything) except infidelity
And had We willed We would have raised a warner in every town
So do not obey the infidels and strive against them with it ( the Quran), a great striving
And He it is Who has let free the two seas, one that quenches thirst, sweet; and the other saltish, bitter. And He has made between them a barrier and prevented (them from getting mixed up, by a) prevention
And He it is Who created man from water and has appointed for him blood relationships and marriage relationships and your Fosterer is Powerful
And they serve (worship) besides Allah that which neither profits them nor harms them. And the infidel is one who helps against his Fosterer
And We have not sent you except as a conveyer of good news and as a warner
Say, "I do not ask you for a reward for this, except that whoever wills, he may take a way towards His Fosterer
And put your trust in the Living Who does not die and glorify (Him) by praising Him, and He is sufficient as One informed of the sins of His servants
(He it is) Who created the skies and the earth and that which is between these two in six days (periods) then He set the balance on the throne (of the universe), the Beneficent (Allah), so ask one who is informed about Him
And when it is said to them, "Prostrate before the Beneficent (Allah)," they say, "And what is the Beneficent? Shall we prostrate before anything you enjoin on us?" And it increases their hatred
Blessed is He Who has made galaxies in the sky and made in it (the sun as) a lamp, and a radiant moon (reflecting sun light)
And He it is Who has made the night and the day succeeding (each other) for one who intends to be mindful or intends to be grateful
And the servants of the Beneficent (Allah) are those who walk on the earth in humility, and when the ignorant address them they say, "Peace
And those who spend the night prostrating and standing before their Fosterer
And those who say, "Our Fosterer! turn away from us the punishment of hell." Its punishment is certainly a lasting difficulty
It is certainly an evil dwelling place/time for staying
And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly and their (spending) is established between these (two limits)
And those who do not pray to another (presumed) god along with Allah, and do not kill any person whose (killing) Allah has forbidden except in (the cause) of truth, and they do not commit adultery and whoever does that, he will meet (the punishment of his) sin
The punishment will be doubled for him on the day of resurrection and he will stay therein, disgraced
except he who repented and believed and did righteous work, then for them Allah will change their evil deeds to good deeds, and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And he who repents and does righteous work, then he is certainly the one who turns to Allah in (true) repentance
And those who do not witness falsehood, and when they pass by that which is vain, they pass by honourably
And those who, when they are reminded through the signs of their Fosterer, do not fall down thereat (as if) deaf and blind
And those who say, "Our Fosterer! grant to us through our wives and descendants comfort of the eyes and make us leaders of those who guard (against evil)
Those will be rewarded with high places, because they were patient, and they will be met therein with greetings and peace
They will stay therein, excellent will be the dwelling place/ time for staying
Say, "My Fosterer does not (even) care for you all if you do not pray (to Him), and you have denied so (the consequence of) it will be inevitable." (R 6, P 18 ¼)
Taa Siin Miim
Those are the signs of the book that makes clear
You will perhaps kill yourself with grief because they do not believe
If We will, We can send down on them a sign from the sky, so that their necks would remain bowed down before it
And there does not come to them any new reminder from the Beneficent (Allah) but they turn away from it
So they have denied (it), therefore the news of that which they mock at, will come to them
Did they not see towards the earth how many beneficial (things) of every kind have We caused to grow in it
There is certainly a sign in that but the majority of them does not believe
And your Fosterer ! He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful
And when your Fosterer called out to Musa, that, "Go to the unjust people
people of Firawn. Will they not guard (against evil)
He said, "My Fosterer! I fear that they will deny me
further, my bosom straitens and my language is not fluent, so send for Harun (to help me)
And they have (the charge of) a crime against me so I fear that they will kill me
He said, "By no means, so both of you go with Our signs, We are with you, Hearing
So go to Firawn then say: We are sent (by) the Fosterer of the worlds (with a message)
that you should send the children of Israel with us
He (Firawn) said, "Were you not fostered among us as a child? And you did stay among us for many years of your life
and you did that deed of yours which you did and you are of the ungrateful ones
He said, "I did it then, when I was of those in error
so I fled from you when I feared you, but my Fosterer granted me wisdom and made me one of the messengers
Now (should) that favour with which you favoured me (become the cause) for your enslaving the children of Isreal?”
Firawn said, "And who is the Fosterer of the worlds
He said, "The Fosterer of the skies and the earth and that which is between them, if you (want) to be of those who are certain
He said to those around him, "Do you not hear
He said, "Your Fosterer and the Fosterer of your ancient fathers
He said, "Your messenger who has been sent to you is certainly possessed by jinn
He said, "Fosterer of the east and the west and that which is between them, if you have sense
He said, "If you take a god other than me I will definitely place you among the prisoners
He said, "Even if I bring to you something as a clear proof
He said, "Then bring it, if you are of the truthful ones
So he threw down his staff when it became a clear serpent
and he drew out his hand when it became white for those who were seeing
He (Firawn) said to the leaders (of his community) around him, "This is certainly a learned magician
he intends to drive you out from your land by his magic, so what do you advise
They said, "Keep him and his brother (waiting) in hope and send into the cities (your officials) who gather (people)
(so that) they should bring to you every learned magician
So the magicians were gathered at the appointed time on a known day
And it was said to the people, "Will you gather
so that we may follow the magicians if they are the winners
So when the magicians came, they said to Firawn, "Is there a sure reward for us if we are the winners
He said, "Yes, then you will certainly be of those who are near (to me)
Musa said to them, "Cast down what you are going to cast down
So they cast down their ropes and their rods and said, "By the might of Firawn we will certainly be winners
Then Musa cast down his staff when it swallowed that which they had falsely devised
Consequently the magicians were thrown down prostrating
They said, "We believe in the Fosterer of the worlds
Fosterer of Musa and Harun
He (Firawn) said, "You believe in him before I give you permission, he is certainly your chief who taught you magic, but you will know, I will definitely cut off your hands and your feet from opposite sides and I will definitely crucify you all together
They said, "No harm, we will return to our Fosterer
we certainly hope that our Fosterer will protectively forgive us our faults, because we are the first of the believers
And We communicated to Musa that, "Take away my servants by night, you will be pursued
So Firawn sent into the cities (his officials) who gathered (people)
(saying), "They are certainly a small party
and they have angered us
and we are an alert army
Thus did We drive them out from gardens and springs
and treasures and an honoured position
Like that (it happened). And We made the children of Israel to inherit them
So they pursued them at sunrise
So when the two parties saw each other, the companions of Musa said, "We are caught
He said, "By no means, My Fosterer is certainly with me, He will guide me
So We communicated to Musa that, "Strike the sea with your staff," so it was split and each part became like a great mountain
And We brought others near, there (at the same place)
and We delivered Musa and those with him, all together
then We drowned the others
In that there is certainly a sign, but the majority of them does not believe
And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful
And Tell them the story of Abraham
when he said to his father and his people, "What do you worship
They said, "We worship idols and we will remain sticking to them
He said, "Do they listen to you when you pray to (them)
or benefit you or harm you
They said, "No, we found our fathers doing like that
He said, "Then do you see, that which you worship
you and your fathers before you
For they are enemies to me except the Fosterer of the worlds
Who created me, then He it is Who guides me
and Who feeds me and gives me to drink
and when I am sick, then He it is Who cures me
and Who will cause me to die, then give me life (again)
and (from) Whom I hope, that He will protectively forgive me my mistakes on the day of judgment
My Fosterer! grant me wisdom and join me with the righteous
and assign for me a true mention among later (generations)
and place me among the inheritors of the garden of bliss
and protectively forgive my father, he is certainly among those who are astray
and do not disgrace me on the day they are raised (again)
the day on which neither wealth nor sons will benefit
except him who comes to Allah with a pure heart
And the garden will be brought near for those who guard (against evil)
And the hell will be made manifest to the erring ones
And it will be said to them, "Where are those whom you used to worship
besides Allah? Can they help you or help themselves
Then they will be thrown headlong into it, they and the misleaders
and the army of Iblis (devil), all together
They will say while they quarrel therein
By Allah, we were certainly in clear error
when we considered you equal to the Fosterer of the worlds
and no one has misled us except the criminals
so we have no mediators
and no intimate friend
So if we are given (another chance to) return (to the world), then we will certainly be of those who believe
There is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe
And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful
The people of Nuh denied the messengers
when their brother Nuh said to them, "Will you not guard (against evil)
I am certainly a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear Allah and obey me
and l do not ask you for any reward for it, my reward is with none but the Fosterer of the worlds
so fear Allah and obey me
They said, "Shall we believe in you when the worst (people) follow you
He said, "And what knowledge do I have of what they do
(The responsibility of taking) their account is on none but my Fosterer, if you (could only) realize
And I am not (supposed) to drive away the believers
I am nothing but a plain warner
They said, "If you do not desist, O Nuh! you will definitely be of those who are stoned (to death)
He said, "My Fosterer! my people have certainly denied me
so decide between me and them (by pronouncing) a judgment, and deliver me and those of the believers who are with me
So We delivered him and those with him, in the loaded ship
Then after that We drowned those who remained behind
There is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe
And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful
The (people of) Aad denied the messengers
when their brother Hud said to them, "Will you not guard (against evil)
I am certainly a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear Allah and obey me
and I do not ask you for any reward for it, my reward is with none but the Fosterer of the worlds
Do you build a monument on every high place, without any purpose
And you take (for dwellings) strong fortresses that perhaps you may stay (in them for ever)
And when you take hold (of people), you take hold (of them) as tyrants
So fear Allah and obey me
And fear Him Who helped you with that which you know
He has helped you with cattle and sons
and gardens and springs
I certainly fear for you the punishment of the great day
They said, "It is equal to us whether you admonish or you do not be of those who admonish
This is nothing but a customary (warning) of the ancient
and we will not be punished
Thus they denied him, therefore We destroyed them, there is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe
And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful
The (people of) Samood denied the messengers
when their brother Saleh said to them, "Will you not guard (against evil)
I am certainly a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear Allah and obey me
And I do not ask you for any reward for it, my reward is with none but the Fosterer of the worlds
Will you be left secure in that which is here
in gardens and springs
and cultivations and date palms, the spathes of which break (due to the weight of the fruit)
And you exultingly carve houses out of mountains
so fear Allah and obey me
and do not obey the command of the extravagant
who cause corruption in the earth and do not act aright
They said, "You are only one of the bewitched,* * One under the influence of magic
you are nothing but a man like us, so bring a sign if you are of the truthful ones
He said, "This is a she-camel, for it there (is a portion of water for) drinking and for you (a portion of water for) drinking on a known day
And do not afflict her with evil lest the punishment of a great day seize you
But they stabbed her then became regretters
So the punishment seized them, there is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe
And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful. (R)
The people of Lut denied the messengers
when their brother Lut said to them, "Will you not guard (against evil)
I am certainly a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear Allah and obey me
and I do not ask you for any reward for it, my reward is with none but the Fosterer of the worlds
What! of all creatures you approach males
and leave those of your wives whom your Fosterer has created for you? No, you are a transgressing people
They said, "If you do not desist, O Lut! you will definitely be of those who are driven out
He said, "I am certainly of those who hate your acts
My Fosterer ! deliver me and my followers from that which they do
So We delivered him and his followers all together
except an old woman, (who was) among those who remained behind
Then We destroyed the others
and We rained on them a rain, so evil was the rain of those who were warned
There is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe
And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful (R)
The inhabitants of the jungle denied the messengers
when Shuaib said to them, "Will you not guard (against evil)
I am certainly a trustworthy messenger to you
so fear Allah and obey me
and I do not ask you for any reward for it, my reward is with none but the Fosterer of the worlds
Give back full measure and do not be of those who cause loss
And weigh with a balance that is straight (correct)
and do not give less to people, the things due to them, and do not cause disturbance in the earth being corrupt
and fear Him Who created you and the ancient generations
They said, "You are only one of the bewitched
and you are nothing but a man like us, and our guess about you is that you are of those who lie
Then make pieces from the sky to fall on us if you are of the truthful ones
He said, "My Fosterer knows best about what you do
So they denied him therefore the punishment of the over shadowing cloud seized them, it was certainly a punishment of a great day
There is certainly a sign in that, but the majority of them does not believe
And your Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful
And the (Quran) has certainly been sent down by the Fosterer of the worlds
the trustworthy spirit came down with it
on your heart that you may be (one) of the warners
in plain Arabic language
and it is (mentioned) in ancient scriptures (too)
Is it not a sign for them that the learned (men among) the children of Israel know it
And had We sent it down on any of the foreigners
and had he recited it to them, they would not have believed in it
Thus did We cause it to enter into the hearts of the criminals
(that) they should not believe in it till they see the painful punishment
which will come upon them suddenly while they are not conscious
then they will say, "Shall we be given time (for amendment)
What ! do they still seek to hasten on Our punishment
Then do you see? If We make them enjoy for years
then there comes to them that which they were promised
(at that time), that which they were made to enjoy will not be of any use to them
And We did not destroy any town but it had its warners
(for) reminding, and We are not unjust
And the devils have not come down with the (Quran)
and it neither suits them nor are they capable (of doing it)
(on the contrary) they have been removed far away (even) from hearing (it)
So do not pray to another (presumed) god with Allah, lest you be of those who are punished
And warn your family (consisting) of close relatives
And lower your wing for him who follows you from among the believers
And if they disobey you then say, "I am certainly free of that which you do
And put your trust in the Mighty, the Merciful
Who sees you when you stand
and your movements among those who prostrate
He is certainly the Hearing, the Knowing
Should I inform you (of those) on whom the devils come down
They come down on every liar, sinner
they deliver hearsay and most of them are liars
And the poets, those in error follow them
Do you not see that they wander distracted in every valley
and that they say that which they do not practice
except those who believe and do righteous works and remember Allah much, and defend themselves after the in-justice that is done to them? And those who are unjust will know, to which place of turning back they will turn back
Taa Siin. Those are the signs of' the Quran and a book that makes clear
a guidance and good news for the believers
who establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and they are certain of the hereafter
For those who do not believe in the hereafter, We have certainly made their deeds fair seeming to them, so they blindly wander
those are the persons for whom there is a severe punishment and in the hereafter they will be the greatest losers
And you are certainly made to receive the Quran from the Wise, the Knowing
When Musa said to his family, "I perceive a fire, I will bring information to you from it or I will come to you with a flaming and burning brand, so that you may warm yourselves
So when he came to it, a voice was heard that, "Blessed is whoever is in the fire and whoever is around it and glory be to Allah the Fosterer of the worlds
O Musa ! I am Allah, the Mighty, the Wise
And throw your staff," then when he saw it moving as if it were a snake he turned back retreating and did not return. "O Musa! do not fear, the messengers do not fear (when they are) with Me
nor he who was unjust, then he changed it (with) good after the evil, for I am certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And enter your hand into (the opening of) your bosom, it will come out white without any evil. (These are) among the nine signs to Firawn and his people, they are certainly a transgressing people
So when Our visible signs came to them, they said, "This is clear magic
And they knowingly denied it unjustly and proudly while they were certain about it (in) their souls (minds). Then see how the end of those who were corrupt, was (brought about)
And We had given knowledge to Dawood and Sulaiman and they said, "Praise is due only for Allah Who has preferred us above many of His believing servants
And Sulaiman was Dawood's heir and he said, "O mankind! we have been taught the speech of birds and we have been given of everything. This is certainly a clear grace
And his armies of the jinn and human beings and the birds were gathered before Sulaiman and they were formed into ordered ranks
until when they came to a valley of the ants, an ant said, "O you ants! enter your houses lest Sulaiman and his armies crush you while they do not perceive
So he smiled (and) laughed at its statement and said, "My Fosterer! grant me such orderliness that I should be grateful for Your favour with which You have favoured me and my parents, and that I should do such righteouswork which should please You; and admit me by Your mercy, among Your righteous servants
And he sought for the birds, then said, "How is it that I do not see the hoopoe or is he among those who arc absent
I will definitely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him or he should definitely come to me with a clear authority (justifying his absence)
So without making (him) wait for long (the hoopoe came) and said, "I have acquired (knowledge) of that which you do not know, and I bring to you true news from Saba
I found a woman ruling over them and she has been given of everything and she has a great throne
I found her and her people prostrating to the sun besides Allah, and the devil has made their deeds fair seeming to them and turned them away from the way, so they are misguided (to the extent)
that they do not prostrate to Allah Who brings forth that which is hidden in the skies and the earth and knows that which you hide and that which you make public
Allah, there is no god except Him, He is the Lord of the great throne (of the universe)
He said, "We will see whether you speak the truth or you are of the liars
Go with this letter of mine and deliver it to them, then turn away from them and see what (answer) they return
(The Queen) said, "O you chiefs! an honourable letter has been delivered to me
it is from Sulaiman, and it is: In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful
that, exalt not yourselves against me and come to me as those who submit (as Muslims)." (R)
She said, "O you chiefs! advise me in this affair of mine, I do not decide an affair until you are present with me
They said, "We are endued with strength and endued to fight severely, and it is on you to command, therefore you see what you (wish) to command
She said When kings enter a township, they certainly cause disorder in it, and make the mightiest of its people most disgraced and thus they (too) will do
and I am sending a gift to them, so as to see with (what answer) the messengers return
So when be (the envoy) came to Sulaiman he said, "What ! will you help me with wealth? But that which Allah has given me is better than that which he has given you. No, it is you who are happy with your gift (not I)
Return to them, and we will definitely come to them with armies which they will not be able to oppose, and we will definitely drive them out from there, disgraced, and they will be degraded
He said “O you chiefs ! which of you will bring her throne to me before they come to me surrendering (as Muslims)
One cleverly alert among the jinn said, "I will bring it to you before you rise from your place and I certainly have the reliable strength to do it
One who had knowledge of the book* said, "I will bring it to you before the blinking of your eye." So when he saw it settled in his presence, he said, "This is (something) from the grace of my Fosterer to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful, and one who is grateful, then his being grateful is only for (the benefit of) his own soul and one who is ungrateful, then my Fosterer is certainly Independent, Honourable." * Law of teletransportation
He said, "Make her throne unrecognizable for her, we will see whether she is capable of receiving guidance or she is of those who are not capable of receiving guidance
So when she came, it was said to her, "Is your throne like this?" She said, "It is just like it and we were given the know edge before it and we have submitted (as Muslims)
And that which she worshipped besides Allah, had hindered her (earlier), she was certainly of the people who were infidels
It was said to her, “Enter the palace.” So when she saw it, she thought it to be an expanse of water and removed (the covering) from her ankles (to cross it). He (Sulaiman) said, "It is a palace made smooth with glass.” She said, “My Fosterer! I have been unjust to myself and I submit with Sulaiman to Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds
And We indeed sent to Samood their brother Saleh, (saying) that, “Serve Allah,” when they became two parties disputing (with each other)
He said, “O my people! why do you seek to hasten on the evil before the good, why do you not seek protective forgiveness of Allah that you may be dealt with mercifully?”
They said, “We have met with ill luck because of you and because of those with you." He said, “Your ill luck is with Allah, no, you are a people who are being tested.”
And there were nine persons in the city who caused corruption in the land and did not act right
They said, “Swear to each other by Allah that we will definitely attack him and his people by night, then we will definitely say to his heir: we did not witness the destruction of his people and we certainly speak the truth.”
And they planned a plan and We (too) planned a plan while they did not perceive
Then see what was the end of their plan, We destroyed them and their people all together
So those are their houses fallen down because they were unjust, there is certainly a sign in that for a people who know
And We delivered those who believed and who had guarded (against evil)
And (We sent) Lut, when he said to his people, “Why do you commit indecency while approach men besides women? No, you are an ignorant people.”
What! Do you indeed lustfully approach men besides women? No, you are an ignorant people
So the reply of his people was nothing but they said, "Drive out Lut's followers from your town, they are persons who want to be clean.”
So We delivered him and his followers except his wife, We destined her to be of those who remained behind
And We rained on them a rain, so evil was the rain of those who were warned. (R)
Say, “Praise is due only for Allah, and peace on His servants whom He has chosen. Is Allah better or that which they associate as partners (with Him)
Who is it, Who has created the skies and the earth and sent down for you water from the sky? Then We cause to grow through it, beautiful gardens, it is not (possible) for you to cause the trees to grow therein. Is there a god with Allah? No, they are a people who equate (others with Allah)
Who is it, Who has made the earth a place for staying, and made rivers in the passages therein, and made mountains on it, and made a barrier between the two seas? Is there a god with Allah? No, the majority of them does not know
Who is it, Who responds to the distressed when he prays to Him and removes the evil and makes you successors of the earth? Is there a god with Allah? Little is it that you mind
Who is it, Who guides you in the darkness of the land and the sea, and Who sends the winds as good news before His mercy? Is there a god with Allah? Highly Exalted is Allah above that which they associate as partners (with Him)
Who is it, Who begins the creation then gets it reproduced, and Who provides you from the sky and the earth? Is there a god with Allah? Say, “Bring your proof if you are truthful.”
Say, “No one in the skies and the earth knows the unseen except Allah, and they do not perceive when they will be raised.”
No, their knowledge has reached (its limit with regard to its penetration) into the hereafter, no, they are in a doubt regarding it, no, they are blind regarding it. (R)
And those who do not believe say, “What! when we become (part of the) soil and our fathers (too), will we be brought out
We have been promised this, we and our fathers before, these are nothing but stories of the ancient
Say, “Travel in the earth, then see how the end of the criminals was (brought about).”
And do not grieve over them nor be in distress because of that which they plan
And they say, "When will this promise (be fulfilled) if you are truthful?”
Say, “It may be that part of that which you are seeking to be hastened on, is following you closely.”
And your Fosterer is certainly full of grace for mankind but the majority of them is not grateful
And your Fosterer certainly knows that which is hidden in their bosoms and that which they make public
And there is nothing of the unseen in the sky and the earth but it is (recorded) in a clear record
This Quran certainly narrates to the children of Israel, most of those (matters) in which they differ
and it is certainly a guide and mercy for the believers
Your Fosterer will certainly decide between them by His judgment, and He is the Mighty, the Knowing
so put your trust in Allah, you are certainly on clear truth
You cannot make the dead to hear nor can you make the deaf to hear the call when they return retreating
nor can you lead the blind (away) from their error, you can make no one to hear except those who believe in Our signs, so they submit (as Muslims)
And when the word becomes incumbent on them, We will bring out for them a living creature from the earth which will speak to them because mankind was not sure of Our signs
And the day We will gather from every community, batches of those who denied Our signs, they will be formed in to ordered ranks
until when they come (before Allah), He will say, “Did you deny My signs and did not comprehend them in (your ) knowledge, or what was it that you did?”
And the word will become incumbent on them because they were unjust, so they will not (be able to) speak
Did they not see that We have made the night that they may rest therein and the day to give visibility? In that there are certainly signs for a people who believe
And the day it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe), then whoever is in the skies and whoever is in the earth will be horrified except such as Allah wills, and all will come to Him humbled
And you see the mountains, you suppose them to be firm, but they will pass away like the passing away of clouds. The work of Allah Who perfected everything. He is certainly informed of what you do
Whoever comes with good, then for him is (a reward) better than that and they will be among those who will be secure from the horror of that day
And Whoever comes with evil, they will be thrown on their faces into the fire. Will you be rewarded (for something) other than that which you used to do
I am commanded only to serve the Fosterer of this city (of Mecca) which He has made sacred and to Whom belongs everything, and I am commanded to be among those who submit (as Muslims)
and to read (and follow ) the Quran, because one who receives guidance, then he receives guidance only (for the benefit) of his own soul, and one who goes astray,( does so for his own loss), then say (to him, “ I am only of those who warn.”)
And say, “Praise is due only for Allah Who will show His signs to you, so that you will recognize them, and your Fosterer is not unaware of what you do.”
Taa Siin Miim
Those are the signs of the book that makes clear
We recite to you (something) from the history of Musa and Firawn with truth, for a people who believe
Firawn certainly exalted himself in the land and made its people (divided) into sects, weakening a party from among them, getting their sons slaughtered and leaving their women alive, he was certainly among those who caused corruption
And We intended to bestow favour on those who were weakened in the land and make them leaders and make them the inheritors
and establish them in the earth, and to make Firawn and Haman and their armies see through them, that against which they were cautious
So We communicated to the mother of Musa, “Suckle him, but when you fear about him (that they may slaughter him) then cast him into the river and do not fear nor grieve, We will certainly bring him back to you and We will make him (one) of the messengers.”
Then the people of Firawn picked him up that he might be an enemy to them and (a source of) grief. Firawn and Haman and their armies were certainly at fault
And the wife of Firawn said, “Comfort of the eye for me and you, do not kill him, it may be that he will be of (some) benefit to us or we may take him as a son,” and they did not perceive
And the heart of Musa’s mother became void (of patience and) she would have almost exposed it had We not strengthened her heart so that she might remain among the believers
And she said to his sister, “Follow him,” so she kept him in sight from a distance and they did not perceive
And before this, We had forbidden on him suckling (from foster mothers). So she (Musa’s sister) said, “Should I show to you, people of a house who can take up the responsibility (of suckling) him for you, and who will take good care of him?”
Thus We brought him back to his mother, that her eye might be comforted and that she might not grieve, and that she might know that the promise of Allah is true, but the majority of them does not know
And when he reached his strength and balance (maturity), We granted to him wisdom and knowledge and thus do We reward the doers of good
And he entered the city when its people were unaware, and found therein two men fighting, one from his sect and the other from his enemies. Then he who was of his sect asked him for help over him who was from his enemies. So Musa struck him with his fist thus killing him. He said, “This is an act of the devil, he is certainly an enemy who clearly misleads.”
He said, “My fosterer! I have been unjust to myself so protectively forgive me.” So He protectively forgave him, He is certainly the Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
He Said, “My Fosterer! Because you have bestowed favour on me, therefore I will never be a helper of the criminals.”
So he entered into the city in the morning fearfully vigilant. Then, when he whom he had helped the day before (again) cried to him for help, Musa said to him, “You are certainly one erring openly.”
And when he intended to catch him, who was an enemy to them both, he said, “O Musa! do you intend to kill me as you killed a person the day before? You intend nothing but to be a tyrant in the land and you do not intend to be of those who set things right.”
And a man came running from the farthest end of the city, saying, “O Musa! the chiefs are consulting about you to kill you, therefore get away, I am certainly (one) of your well wishers.”
So he went away from there fearfully vigilant. He said, “My Fosterer! save me from the unjust people.”
And when he turned his face towards Midian he said, “Perhaps my Fosterer will guide me to a balanced way.”
And when he came to the watering (place) of Midian he found there a group of people watering (their flocks), and besides them, he found two women staying back. He said, “ What is the matter with you?” They said, “We cannot water until the shepherds take away (their flocks), and our father is a very old man.”
So he watered for them, then turned back to the shade and said, “My Fosterer! I am certainly in need of whatever good you send down on me.”
Then one of the two (women) came to him walking shyly, she said, “My father invites you that he may reward you with a payment for having watered for us.” So when he came to him and narrated (his) narrative, he said, “Do not fear, you are safe from the unjust people.”
One of the two (women) said, “O my father! employ him (on wages), certainly the best among those whom you can employ, is the one (who is) strong, trustworthy.”
He said, “I intend to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine, on condition that you should be in my employment for eight years but if you complete ten then it will be from (your own good will), and I do not intend to put you under hardship, and if Allah wills, you will find me of the righteous.”
He said, “ That (is settled) between me and you, whichever of the two terms I fulfill, but let there be no unjust (compulsion) on me, and Allah is the Trustee over what we say.”
Then when Musa fulfilled the term and was traveling by night with his family he perceived a fire on the side of the Mount Toor. He said to his family, “Stay here! I perceive fire, may be I will bring to you some news from it or a brand from the fire that you may warm yourselves.”
So when he came to it, he was called from the tree in the blessed spot of the right (hand) side of the valley, that, “O Musa! I am Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds.”
And that, “Cast down your staff,” then when he saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned back retreating and did not return. “O Musa! come near and do not fear, you are certainly of those who are secure
put your hand into (the opening of) your bosom, it will come out white without (this effect being due to some) illness, and draw your armpit towards yourself (to get rid) of the fear. So those two are the proofs (of your prophet hood) from your Fosterer to Firawn and his chiefs, they are certainly a transgressing people.”
He said, “My Fosterer! I have killed a person from among them, so I fear that they will kill me
and my brother Harun, he is more eloquent than me in speech, so send him with me as a helper to confirm me, I fear that they will deny me.”
He said, “We will strengthen your arm with your brother, and assign authority to both of you, so that they will not be able to advance towards you because of Our signs. Both of you and those who follow you two will be victorious.”
So when Musa came to them with Our clear signs, they said, “This is nothing but forged magic and we have not heard of this among our ancient fathers.”
And Musa said, “My Fosterer knows best about him who comes with guidance from Him and foe whom is the final (good) home. And those who are unjust will certainly not be successful.”
And Firawn said, “O you chiefs! I do not know of any god for you other than me, so O Haman! put the fire over the clay for me (for preparing bricks) an make for me a lofty tower that I may reach the God of Musa, and I definitely consider him to be of the liars.”
And he considered himself great in the earth, without having the right to do so and his armies (too). And they thought that they will not be returned to Us
So We caught him and his armies, then We threw them in the flowing water of (the sea), then see how the end of the unjust was (brought about)
And We made them leaders inviting towards the fire, and on the day of resurrection they will not be helped
And We made a curse to follow them in this world, and on the day of resurrection they will be among those who are disgracefully hated
And We gave the book to Musa after We had destroyed the earlier generations, visual proofs for mankind and a guidance and a mercy that they may be mindful
And you were not on the western side when We decreed the commandment to Musa and you were not among the witnesses
But We produced generations and life lasted on them, and you were not dwelling among the people of Midian reciting to them Our signs, but We were the senders (of messengers)
And you were not at the side of the Mount Toor when We called out (to Musa), but (this information is) a mercy from your Fosterer that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you that they may be mindful
And had (you) not been (sent and had) they been afflicted with a disaster because of what their hands had sent before, then they would have said, “Our Fosterer! why did You not send a messenger to us, so that we could follow Your signs (instructions) and be among the believers.”
But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “Why is he not given the like of what was given to Musa?” Did they not reject that which was given to Musa earlier? They say, “Two magicians helping each other,” and they say, “We certainly do not believe in all.”
Say, “Then bring a book from Allah which is a better guide than these two (that) I may follow it, if you are truthful.”
But if they do not respond to you, then know that they follow only their desires, and who is more astray than one who follows his desire without guidance from Allah, Allah certainly does not guide the unjust people
And We indeed made the word to reach them that they may be mindful
Those to whom We gave the book before it, they believe in it
And when it is read to them, they say, “We believe in it, it is certainly the truth from our Fosterer, (even) before it (came) we were of those who had submitted (as Muslims).”
Those will be given twice the reward due to them, because they were patient and they turn off evil with good and spend from that which We have provided them
And when they hear vain talk they keep away from it and say, “For us our deeds and for you your deeds, peace be on you, we do not desire (to be involved) with those who are ignorant.”
You certainly cannot guide (him) whom you love, but Allah guides whom He wills and He knows best those who are capable of receiving guidance
And they say, “If we follow the guidance with you, we will be snatched away from our land.” Have We not established (the Kaaba as) a secure sanctuary for them, to which fruits of all kinds are brought (as) a provision from Us? But the majority of them does not know
And how many towns have We destroyed which were boastful in their livelihood? So those are their houses, they have not been dwelt in after them except a little, and We were the inheritors
And your Fosterer did not destroy the towns unless He had raised in their capital a messenger who read to them Our signs, and We do not destroy the towns unless their people are unjust
And things which you are give are a provision of the life of this world and its adornment, and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting. Will you not then understand
Then, is he, whom We have promise a good promised and (the fulfillment of) which he will meet, like him, whom We have made to enjoy the life of this world, then on the day of resurrection he will be presented (before Us for giving an account)
And on the day He will call them and say, “Where are those whom you claimed (that they were) My partners?”
Those against whom the word will be proved true will say, “Our Fosterer! these are the persons whom we led astray, we led them astray as we were ourselves astray. We (seek to) free ourselves from (this sin and come) to You, they did not worship us (on their own).”
And it will be said, “Call your (presumed) partners (of Allah),” so they will call them but they will not respond to them, and they will see the punishment, would that they had received guidance
And on the day He will call them and say, “What response did you give to the messengers?”
On that day (all) the news will be obscured on them so they will not (be able, even to) ask each other
So, as for him who repents and believes and does righteous work, may be he will be among the successful
And your Fosterer creates what He wills and He chooses, the choice is not theirs. Glory be to Allah and Exalted be He above that which they associate (with Him as) partners
And your Fosterer knows that which your bosoms conceal and that which they make public
And He is Allah, there is no god except Him, praise is due only for Him (both) in the earlier (past) and the later (future periods), and His is the command and to Him you will be returned
Say, “Do you consider, if Allah were to make the night everlasting on you till the day of resurrection, (then) who is the god other than Allah who could bring light to you? Will you not then hear?”
Say, “Do you consider, if Allah were to make the day everlasting on you till the day of resurrection, (then) who is the god other than Allah who could bring the night to you that you could rest therein ? Will you not then see
And it is from His mercy that He has made the night and the day for you, that you may rest therein and that you may seek of His grace, and that you may be grateful.”
And on (that) day He will call them and say, “Where are those whom you claimed (that they were) My partners?”
And We will bring out from every community a witness, then We will say, “(All of you) bring your proof.” Then they will know that the truth is Allah’s, and that which they used to forge will go away from them
Qaroon was certainly from among the people of Musa but he oppressed them. And We had given him so much from the treasures, that their keys would have been a burden (even) for a strong group of men possessing strength. When his people said to him, “Do not exult, Allah certainly does not like those who are exultant
but seek the home of the hereafter through that which Allah has given you, and do not forget your portion of the world, and do good (to others) as Allah has done good to you, and do not seek to cause corruption in the earth, Allah certainly does not like those who are corrupt.”
He said, “I have been given this only because of the knowledge I have.” Did he not know that Allah had certainly destroyed, from among the generations before him, those who were more severe than him in strength and more in collection (of people/ wealth)? And the criminals are not asked about their sins (and then punished)
Then he came out before his people in his pomp. Those who intended (to achieve success only) in the life of this world said, “Ah! would that we had the like of what Qaroon is given, he is certainly a possessor of great good fortune.”
But those who were given knowledge said, “Sorrowful is your state, Allah’s reward for him who believes and does righteous work, is better, and no one is made to receive it except those who are patient.”
So We caused him to sink with his house into the earth. Then there was no one from the group to help him against Allah nor was he among those who could defend themselves
And in the morning, those who had longed for his position (only) the day before, (were heard) saying, “Ah! (it is) Allah Who enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His servants and straitens (for whomever and whenever He wills). Had Allah not been gracious to us, He would have caused the sinking along with us. Ah! the ungrateful are not successful.”
That home of the hereafter, We have made for those who intend neither to be proud in the earth nor (to cause) corruption (in it), and the (good) end is for those who guard (against evil)
One who comes for good, then for him there is (something) better than that, and one who comes with evil, then those who do evil will not be rewarded except for that which they used to do
He Who has ordained (the implementation of) the Quran on you will certainly bring you back to the place of return (Mecca). Say, “My Fosterer knows best him who comes with guidance and him who is in clear error.”
And you had not expected that the book would be communicated to you. (It is nothing) but a mercy from your Fosterer, therefore never be a helper of the infidels
and let them not turn you away from the signs of Allah after they have been sent down to you, and invite (people) towards your Fosterer and do not be of the polytheists
And do not pray along with Allah, to any other (presumed) god, there is no god except Him. Everything will perish except His Person, His is the judgment and towards Him will you be returned. (R 9, P 19 ¾)
Alif Laam Miim
Do human beings think that they will be left alone because they say, “We believe,” and they will not be tested
And We did test those before them, that Allah may definitely know (mark out) those who are truthful and definitely know (mark out) the lairs
Do those who do evil think that they will escape Us? Evil is that which they judge
Whoever expects to meet Allah, let (him know that the end of) the term (fixed) by Allah will certainly come, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing
And whoever strives, he strives only for (the benefit of) his own soul. Allah is certainly Independent of the worlds
And those who believe and do righteous works, We will definitely wipe off from them (the effects of) their evil deeds, and We will definitely reward them (with something) better than that which they used to do
And We have enjoined on man goodness to his parents, but if they strive with you that you should associate partners with Me, of which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them, to Me is your return then I will inform you about that which you used to do
And those who believe and do righteous works, We will definitely admit them among the righteous
And among mankind is he who says, “We believe in Allah,” but when he is harmed in (the cause of ) Allah, he regards the persecution of mankind like the punishment of Allah. And when victory comes from your Fosterer, they definitely say, “We were certainly with you.” Is not Allah the Best Knower of that which is there in the bosoms of (those in) the worlds
And Allah definitely knows those who believe and He definitely knows the hypocrites
And those who do not believe say to those who believe, “ Follow our way and we will ( carry the burdens of )your faults.” And they will not be the carriers of anything from their faults, they are certainly liars
And they will definitely carry their own burdens plus burdens with their burdens, and they will definitely be questioned on the day of resurrection about that which they used to forge
And We sent Nuh to his people, so he stayed among them for a thousand years less fifty years, then the flood took hold of them while they were unjust
So We delivered him and his companions of the boat, and made it a sign for the worlds
And (We sent) Ibrahim when he said to his people, “Worship Allah and fear Him, that is the best for you if you know
You worship besides Allah, only idols, and you invent a lie; those whom you worship besides Allah, do not control any provision for you, so seek provision from Allah and worship Him and be grateful to Him, to Him you will be returned
And if you deny, then the communities before you had (also) denied, and nothing is incumbent on the messenger except clear conveyance (of the message).”
Did they not consider how Allah begins the creation than gets it reproduced? That is certainly easy for Allah
Say, “Travel in the earth and see how He began the creation, then Allah produces the later generations, Allah certainly has power over everything
He punishes whom He wills and has mercy on whom He wills, and to Him you will be turned back
And you cannot frustrate Him in the earth nor in the sky, and you have neither a guardian nor a helper besides Allah.”
And those who do not believe in the signs of Allah and (in their) meeting Him, those have lost hope of My mercy and those are the persons for whom there is a painful punishment
So the answer of his (Ibrahim’s) people was nothing except that they said, “Kill him or burn him.” But Allah saved him from the fire. There are certainly signs in that for a people who believe
And he said, “You have taken (for worship) only idols, besides Allah. Your mutual love is in the life of this world, then on the day of resurrection some of you will reject others and some of you will curse others, and your settling place will be the fire and you will not have any helpers.”
So Lut believed in him and said, “I am a migrant towards my Fosterer, He is certainly the Mighty, the Wise.”
And We granted to him (i.e. Ibrahim), Ishaq and Yaqub and made the prophet hood (to remain) in his descendants and (also) the book. And We gave him his reward in the world, and in the hereafter he will certainly be among the righteous
And Lut when he said to his people, “You certainly commit an indecency which no one in the worlds had committed before you
What! do you come to males and cut off the way (for committing robbery) and in your assemblies you commit things not recognised (as good)?” So the answer of his people was nothing except that they said, “Bring upon us the punishment of Allah if you are of the truthful ones.”
He said, “My Fosterer! help me against the corrupt people.”
And when Our messengers came to Ibrahim with good news, they said, “We are going to destroy the people of this town, its people are certainly unjust.”
He said, “(But) Lut is certainly there in it.” They said, “We know better about who is there in it, we will definitely save him and his followers except his wife, she will be of those who remain behind.”
So when the messengers came to Lut, he was grieved on account of them and distressed on account of them (because of his) incapability (to protect them), but they said, “ Do not fear, nor grieve, we will certainly save you and your followers except your wife, she will be of those who remain behind
We are going to bring down on the people of this town a penalty form the sky because they used to exceed the limits.”
And We indeed left a clear sign of it for a people who understand
And to Midian (We sent) their brother Shuaib, so he said, “O my people! serve Allah, and do expect (the coming of) the period hereafter, and do not cause disturbance in the earth being corrupt.”
But they denied him, so the earthquake took hold of them and the morning found them lying motionless in their houses
And the Aad and the Samood, and (their punishment) is indeed clear to you from ( the remains of) their houses. And the devil had made their deeds fair seeming to them (and) thereby turned them away from the way, though they had insight
And Qaroon and Firawn and Haman; and Musa came to them with clear proofs, but they considered themselves great in the earth and (therefore) they could not escape (Our punishment)
So each one We caught on account of his sin. So among them was he on whom We sent a sand-storm (or a rain of hot volcanic debris), and among them was he whom the loud cry afflicted, and among them was he whom We caused to sink into the earth, and among them was he whom We drowned and it was not Allah Who was unjust to them but they used to be unjust to themselves
The likeness of those who have taken guardians besides Allah, is as the likeness of the spider which takes hold of a house and certainly the weakest of (all) the houses is the house, of the spider, if they (only) know
Allah certainly knows whatever thing they pray to, besides Him, and He is the Mighty, the Wise
And those similitude’s, We sent forth for mankind, but none understand them except those who are learned
Allah has created the skies and the earth in reality (it is not an illusion), certainly there are signs in that for the believers
Read that which is communicated to you of the book and establish worship (salat), worship (salat) certainly keeps one away from indecency and things not recognized (as good), and the remembrance of Allah is greatest, and Allah knows the work which you do
And do not dispute with the owners of the book except in (a way) which is better, save (with) those who are unjust among them, and say (to them), “We believe in that which has been sent down to us and sent down to you and our God and your God is One and to Him we submit (as Muslims).”
And thus We have sent down the book to you, so those to whom We gave the book (earlier), believe in it and of these (Meccans too) there are those who believe in it, and no one knowingly denies Our signs except the infidels
And earlier to this, you were not (able) to read from a book nor were you (able) to write it with your right hand. (Had you known reading and writing) then those involved in falsehood would have doubted
No, those are clear signs in the bosoms of those who are given knowledge, and no one knowingly denies Our signs except those who are unjust
And they say, “Why are signs not send down on him from his Fosterer?” Say, “Signs are only with Allah, and I am only a plain warner.”
It is not enough for them that We have sent down to you the book which is read to them? Certainly in that there is mercy, and (it is) a reminder for a people who believe
Say, “Allah is sufficient as a Witness between me and you. He knows whatever is there in the skies and the earth. And those who believe in falsehood and do not believe in Allah, those are the persons who are the losers.”
And they ask you to hasten on the punishment, and had it not been (fixed at the end of) an appointed term, the punishment would have come (to them), and it will definitely come to them suddenly while they do not perceive
They ask you to hasten on the punishment, and hell will certainly encompass the infidels
On that day the punishment will cover them from above them and from beneath their feet and He will say, “Taste that which you used to do.”
O my servants who believe! My earth is certainly vast, so serve Me alone
Every soul tastes death, then you will be returned to Us
And those who believe and do righteous works, they will definitely be settled by Us in high places in a garden beneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein, an excellent reward for those who work (for it)
those who are patient and put their trust in their Fosterer
And how many moving creatures are there which do not carry their provision, Allah provides for them and you (all too) and He is the Hearing, the Knowing
And if you ask them, “Who created the skies and the earth and subjected (to your service) the sun and the moon?” They will definitely say, “Allah.” How then are they turned away (form the truth)
Allah enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His servants and straitens it, for whomever (and whenever He wills), and Allah is certainly the Knower of everything
And if you ask them, “Who sends down the water from the sky then gives life through it to the earth after its death?” They will definitely say, “Allah.” Say, “Praise is due only for Allah, but the majority of them does not understand.”
And this life of the world is nothing but a pastime and play and the home of the hereafter, that certainly is life, if they but know
So when they embark on a ship they pray to Allah, making religion exclusively for Him, but when He brings them safe to the land then they associate partners (with Him)
so as to be ungrateful for that which We gave them and that they may enjoy, but they will come to know
Did they not see that We have made the sanctuary (Kaaba) secure, while human beings are snatched away from around them? Then do they believe in falsehood and are ungrateful for the grace of Allah
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah or denies the truth when it comes to him? Will not the home of the infidel be in hell
And those who strive for Us, We will definitely guide them to Our ways, and Allah is certainly with the doers of good
Alif Laam Miim
The Romans have been defeated
in the lowest (part of) the earth , and they will be victorious after their defeat
within some years; Allah’s is the command in the past and in the future, and on that day the believers will rejoice
with the help of Allah, He helps whom He wills and He is the Mighty, the Merciful
(It is a) promise of Allah. Allah does not go against His promise, but the majority of human beings does not know
They know the superficial (things) of the life of this world and they are unaware about the hereafter
Did they not reflect among themselves, (that) Allah has not created the skies and the earth and which is between them both, but in reality and for an appointed term? But many of the human beings certainly do not believe in the meeting with their Fosterer
Did they not travel in the earth and see how the end of those before them was (brought about)? They were more severe than them in strength and they dug the earth and built upon it more than these have built upon it. And their messengers came to them with clear proofs, so it was not Allah Who was unjust to them but they were unjust to themselves
Then evil was the end of those who did evil, because they denied the signs of Allah and they used mock at them. (R)
Allah begins the creation then He gets it reproduced, then to Him you will be returned
And on the day the hour of doom will be established, the criminals will be in despair
And there will be no mediators for them from among their (presumed) partners (of Allah), and they will reject their (presumed) partners (of Allah)
And on the day the hour of doom will be established, on that day they will be divided
So as for those who believed and did righteous works, they will be made happy in a garden
and as for those who did not believe and denied Our signs and the meeting of the hereafter, those be made to be present in the punishment
So glory be to Allah when you enter the evening and when you enter the morning
And praise is due only for Him (both) in the skies and the earth, and (in) the evening and when are at midday
He brings forth the living from the dead and He brings forth the dead from the living, and He gives life to the earth after its death, and thus you (too) will be brought out (again). (R)
And among His signs is that He created you from the soil then (after that) now you are human beings (who) are scattered (far and wide)
And among His signs is that He created from among yourselves mates for you that you might tranquility in them, and He placed between you love and mercy. Certainly there are signs in that for people who reflect
And among His signs is the creation of the skies and the earth and the difference in your languages and your colors. Certainly there are signs in that for the learned
And among His signs is your sleeping at night, and the day when you seek from His grace. Certainly there are signs in that for people who listen
And among His signs is that He shows you the lightning for fear and hope and He sends down water from the sky, then gives life through it to the earth after its death. Certainly there are signs in that for people who understand
And among His signs is that the sky and the earth subsist by His command, then when He calls (with) a (single) call, at that time you will come out of the earth
And His is whoever (whatever) is in the skies and the earth, all are obedient to Him
And He it is Who begins the creation then gets it reproduced, and that is easiest for Him and His the Highest Similitude in the skies and the earth, and He is the Mighty, the Wise
He sets forth for you a similitude (selecting a situation) from among yourselves. Have you, among those whom your right hands possess (slaves), partners in the provision which We have given you, so you are all equal in it? (Do you) fear them as you fear (each other among) yourselves? Thus do explain Our signs in detail for a people who understand
No, those who are unjust follow their own desires without knowledge. So who can guide him whom Allah leaves to go astray? And they have no helpers
So set (right) your attention for (following) the upright religion which is the original creation of Allah on which He initially created mankind, there is no altering for the creation of Allah, that is established religion (law) but the majority of mankind does not know
(Be of) those who turn to Him in repentance and fear Him and establish worship (salat) and do not of the polytheists
of those who divided their religion and became sects, each party exulting in that which they have with them
And when harm afflicts human beings, they pray to their Fosterer being those who turn to Him repentance, but when He (makes) them taste mercy from Him, then a party of them associates partners with their Fosterer
so as to be ungrateful for that which We have given them, so enjoy yourselves, but you will come know
Or have We sent down on them an authority so that it tells (them something) about that which they should associate as partners with Him
And when We make human beings taste mercy, they rejoice in it, and if evil befalls them because that which their (own) hands have sent forth, then they are in despair
Did they not see that Allah enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (it for whomever and whatever He wills)? Certainly there are signs in that for a people who believe
So give to the relative his due and (also) to the needy and the wayfarer. That is best for those who intend (to seek) the Attention of Allah, and those are the persons who are successful
And that which you give as usury that it may (cause an) increase in the wealth of mankind, it does increase with Allah; but that which you give as charity (zakat) intending (to seek) the Attention of Allah, then those are the persons who (get back) multiplied
It is Allah Who created you then provided for you, then He causes you to die then He will bring to life. Is there anyone of your (presumed) partners (of Allah) who does any of those things? Glory be Him and the Exalted be He above that which they associate (with Him) as partners
Corruption has appeared in the land and the sea because of that which the hands of human beings have earned, that He may make them taste (the result of) a part of that which they have done so that they may return (to the truth)
Say, “Travel in the earth and see how the end of those before (you) was (brought about), most them were polytheists.”
So set (right) your attention for the established religion, before the coming of the day form Allah from which there is no turning away, on that day they will be split (into groups)
Whoever rejects (the truth), then on him is (the responsibility of) his rejection, and whoever does righteous work, then they prepare a (good) habitation for themselves
so that He rewards those who believe and do righteous works, from His grace. He certainly does like the infidels
And among His signs is that He sends the winds as conveyers of good news and that He may make you taste of His mercy and that the ships might sail by His command and that you may seek of His grace and that you may be grateful (to Him)
And We did send messengers to their people before you, and they came to them with clear proofs, then We inflicted retribution on those who were criminals, and helping the believers is incumbent on Us
It is Allah who sends the winds, so they raise the cloud, then He spreads it in the sky as He wills makes it (into) pieces, then you see the rain coming out from the spaces in between it, then when makes it to fall on whom he wills of His servants, then they rejoice
though before it was sent down on them, (just) before it, they were in despair
Then look at the signs of Allah’s mercy, how He gives life to the earth after its death? He is certainly the Giver of life to the dead and He has power over everything
And if We send a wind and they see it yellow, (even) after that they will remain to be those who reject (the truth)
So you certainly cannot make the dead to hear nor can you make the deaf to hear the call when they turn back retreating
And you cannot lead the blind away from their error, you can make none to hear except those who believe in Our signs, so they are the persons who submit (as Muslims)
It is Allah how created you (in a state) of weakness, then He gave strength after (the state weakness, then after (the state of) strength He gave weakness and gray hair. He creates what He wills and He is the Knowing, the Powerful
And on the day the hour of doom will be established, the criminals will swear that they did not for more than an hour, thus they used to be turned away (from truth)
But those who are given knowledge and belief will say, “According to the record of Allah you indeed stayed till the day of resurrection, and this is the day of resurrection, but you, you did not (bother know.”)
So on that day their excuses will not be of (any) benefit to those who were unjust and they will receive the good will (of Allah)
And We have indeed set forth in this Quran every (kind) of similitude for human beings, and if come to them with a sign, those who do not believe will definitely say, “You are nothing but those involved in falsehood.”
Thus does Allah set a seal on the hearts of those who do not know
So be patient, the promise of Allah is certainly true, and do not let those who are not certain, hold in light estimation
Alif Laam Miim
Those are the signs of the book of wisdom
a guidance and a mercy for the doers of good
those who establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and are certain of the hereafter
Those are on guidance from their Fosterer and those are the persons who are successful
And among mankind is he who purchases (as his) pastime issue, misleading of (people) from the way of Allah, without having (any) knowledge, and takes it as a mockery. Those are the persons for whom there is a disgraceful punishment
And when Our signs are read to him he turns back proudly as if he did not hear them, as if there is heaviness in his ears, so convey to him the news of a painful punishment
Those who believe and do righteous works, for them are gardens of bliss
they will certainly stay in them, Allah’s promise is true and He is the Mighty, the Wise
He has created the skies (heavenly bodies) without any support that you see, and He has put mountains in the earth lest it should shake with you, and He has spread in it all (kinds) of moving creatures, and We sent down water from the sky, then We caused every kind of beneficial (thing) to grow therein
This is the creation of Allah, so show me that which those besides Him have created, no, the unjust are in clear error. (R)
And indeed We gave wisdom to Luqman, that: be grateful to Allah, and one who is grateful then he is grateful only for (the benefit of) his own soul, and one who is ungrateful then Allah is certainly Independent, Praised, fit of) his own soul, and one who is ungrateful then Allah is certainly Independent, Praised
and when Luqman said to son while admonishing him, “O my son! do not associate (any partner) with Allah. Polytheism is certainly a great injustice.”
And We have enjoined on man regarding his parents, his mother carried him (in states of) weakness upon weakness, and his weaning (was completed) in two years, (so these obligations demand) that (you) be grateful to Me and to your parents, towards Me is the destination
And if they strive with you that you should associate with Me (something) about which you have no knowledge, then do not obey them, but keep company with them in this world (in a manner that is) recognized (as good), and follow the way of him who turns to Me, then to Me is your return, then I will inform you about that which you used to do
(Luqman further said), “O my son! even if it is the weight of the grain of a mustard seed and it is in a rock or in the skies or in the earth, Allah will bring it, (because) Allah is certainly Subtlety Informed
O my son! establish worship (salat) and enjoin that which is recognized (as good) and stop (people) from that which is not recognized (as good) and be patient on whatever befalls on you, that certainly is among the deciding factors of affairs
And do not turn away your cheek boastfully from people nor walk proudly in the earth, Allah certainly does not like anyone who considers himself great, boastful
And be moderate in your walk and lower your voice, the harshest of voices is certainly the voice of the ass.”
Did you not consider that Allah has subjected to your service that which is in the skies and that which is in the earth and has (showered) His favors on you excessively (both) externally and internally? And among mankind is he who disputes regarding Allah without knowledge and without guidance and without a book giving light
And when it is said to them, “Follow that which Allah has sent down,” they say, “No, we will follow that on which we found our fathers.” What! even if the devil used to invite them to the punishment of blazing fire
And one who submits himself to Allah and he is the doer of good, then he has indeed caught hold of a strong handle for which there is no breaking off, and the (decision of) the consequences of affairs is Allah’s
And one who does not believe, do not let his infidelity grieve you, to Us is their return, so We will inform them of that which they did. Allah is certainly the Knower of that which is in the bosoms
We will make them enjoy a little then We will drive them towards a harsh punishment
And if you ask them, “Who created the skies and the earth?” They will definitely say, “Allah.” Say, “Praise is due only for Allah, but the majority of them does not know.”

And had all the trees that are in the earth been pens and the sea (were ink) with seven more seas added to it, (even then) the words of Allah would not be exhausted, Allah is certainly Mighty, Wise
Your creation and your raising is nothing but like (the creation and raising of) a single soul. Allah is certainly Hearing, Seeing
Did you not consider that Allah makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night and He has compelled the sun and the moon (to follow His laws), each one moves till an appointed term, and that Allah is informed of what you do
That is because Allah is the Reality and that which they pray to besides Him, is falsehood; and that Allah is the High, the Great
Did you not consider that the ships sail in the sea due to Allah’s favor, that He may show you (some) of His signs? Certainly there are signs in that for every patient, grateful one
And when a wave covers them like overshadowing clouds, they pray to Allah, making religion exclusively for Him, but when He brings them safe to the land, then among them there are those who compromise (by not continuing to keep religion purely for Allah); and no one knowingly denies Our signs except every traitor, ungrateful one
O mankind! be careful of your Fosterer and fear the day when a father will not be able to pay for the penalty on behalf of his son, and the son will not be able to pay for anything by way of penalty on behalf of his father. Allah’s promise is certainly true, so do not let the life of this world deceive you nor let the deceiver deceive you about Allah
The knowledge of the hour of doom is certainly with Allah. And He sends down the rain. And He knows that which is in the wombs. And no person knows what he will earn tomorrow (in future). And no person knows in what (part of) the earth he will die. Allah is certainly Knowing, Informed
Alif Laam Miim
The sending down of the book, in which there is nothing doubtful, (is) from the Fosterer of the worlds
Or do they say, “He has forged it?” No, it is the truth from your Fosterer that you may warn a people to whom no warner has come before you, they that may receive guidance
It is Allah Who created the skies and the earth and that which is between them both, in six periods, then He set the balance on the throne (of the universe). You do not have besides Him any guardian nor do you have a mediator. Then, will you not be mindful
He governs the affair from the sky to the earth, then it will ascend to Him in a day, the measure of which is a thousand years of that which you count
That is the Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty, the Merciful
Who made good everything which He created, and He began the creation of man from clay
then made His progeny from something (sperm and egg) taken out from the fluid (which is) weakened after vigour
then He set him in equilibrium and breathed into him from His spirit and made for you the (sources of) hearing and seeing and the hearts, little is the gratitude you show
And they say, “What! when we are lost in the earth, will we then be in a new creation?” No, they do not believe in (their) meeting with their Fosterer
Say, “The angel of death, who is entrusted with you, will take you back (cause you to die), then to your Fosterer you will be returned.”
And if you (could only) see, when the criminals would bow down their heads before their Fosterer (pleading), “Our Fosterer! we have seen and heard, so send us back we will do righteous work, (now) we are certain.”
And had We willed We could have guided every soul, but the word from Me that, “I will fill hell with the jinn and human beings together,” will be (proved) true
So taste (the punishment), because you forgot the meeting of this day of yours We (too) will forget you. And taste the everlasting punishment because of that which you used to do
Only those believe in Our signs who, when they are reminded through them, fall down prostrate and glorify by praising their Fosterer and they do not consider themselves great
Their sides keep away from their beds, they pray to their Fosterer in fear and in hope and they spend from that which We have provided them
So no soul knows what is hidden from it, of (that which) comforts the eye, (as a) reward for that which they used to do
Then, is he who is a believer, like him who is a transgressor? They are not equal
As for those who believe and do righteous works, for them are gardens as (their) settling place, a gift for what they used to do
And as for those who transgress, their settling place is the fire, whenever they will intend to come out of it, they will be returned into it and it will be said to them, “Taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny.”
And We will definitely make them taste (something) from a nearer punishment besides the greater punishment, that they may return
And who is more unjust than one who is reminded through the signs of his Fosterer, then he turns away from them? We will definitely inflict retribution on the criminals
And We indeed gave the book to Musa, so do not be in doubt about his receiving it, and We made it a guide for the children of Israel
And when they were patient and they had certainty in Our signs, We made from among them leaders who guided by Our command
Your Fosterer will certainly decide between them on the day of resurrection, concerning that wherein they used to differ
I s it not (enough) for their guidance: How many of the generations before them did We destroy, in whose dwelling places they walk? Certainly there are signs in that. Will they not then hear
Did they not see that We drive the water to the barren earth, then We bring out vegetation from it, from which their cattle and they themselves eat, will they not then see
And they say, “When will this judgment be if you are truthful?”
Say, “On the day of judgment, the believing of those who had not believed (earlier) will not benefit them, and they will not be given time (for amendment).”
So keep away from them and wait, they (too) are certainly waiting
O prophet! fear Allah and do not obey the infidels and the hypocrites, Allah is certainly Knowing, Wise
And follow that which is communicated to you from your Fosterer, Allah is certainly informed of what you do
And put your trust in Allah and Allah is sufficient as a Trustee
Allah has not made for any man two hearts inside him, and He has not made your wives, whom you orally declare to be your mothers, your (real) mothers, and He has not made, those whom you adopt as sons, your (real) sons. Those are (just) statements from your mouths and Allah speaks the truth and He guides to the (right) way
Call them by their father’s (name), that will be more just with Allah, but if you do not know their father, then they are your brothers in religion and your friends. And there is no sin on you in that which you did by mistake in that (affair), but that which your hearts do intentionally (is accountable), and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
The prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are (closer than) their mothers. And the Possessors of relationship are closer, one to another in the decree of Allah, than the believers and the immigrants, except that you do (some) recognized (good) to your friends, that is written in the book
And when We took their pledge from the prophets and from you and from Nuh and Ibrahim and Musa and Isa the son of Maryam and We took a firm pledge from them
that He may ask the truthful about their truth; and He has prepared a painful punishment for the infidels
O you who believe! remember Allah’s favor on you when the armies came (against) you (at the battle of trench) , and We sent against them wind and forces which you did not see while Allah is a Seer of that which you do
when they came to you from above you and from below you and when your eyes deviated (from their normal looks) and the hearts reached the throats and you (started) guessing about Allah, guesses
there the believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking
and when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts was a disease said, “That which Allah and His messenger promised us is nothing but deception,”
and when a group from among them said, “O people of Yasrib (Madina) ! you have no stand, so return,” and a party from among them sought permission of the prophet, saying, “Our houses are certainly exposed,” when they were not exposed, they intended nothing but to run away
And had (the enemy) entered upon them from all sides (of the city and) then (if) persecution was demanded from them, they would have dome it (against you) and (in that case) they would not have been allowed to stay in it but for a short while, e
they had indeed made an agreement with Allah earlier, that they would not turn their backs, and (they) will be questioned regarding (the fulfillment of their) agreement with Allah
“Your running away will never benefit you if you are running away from death or murder, and in that case you are not allowed to enjoy but a little,” (because ultimately you have to die)
Say, “Who is it that can protect you from Allah if He intends evil for you or He intends mercy for you.” And they will not find for themselves, any guardian or helper besides Allah
Allah indeed knows those among you who stop (others) and those who stop to their brothers, “Come to us,” and they do not come to fight but a little
being selfish with respect to you. So when the fear comes, you see them looking at you with their eyes rolling like one under the cover of death, then when the fear goes away, they meet you with sharp tongues, being selfish for good things. Those are the persons who have not believed so Allah has made their deeds fruitless, and that is easy for Allah
They think that the armies of enemies have not gone away. And if the armies of enemies should come (again) they would love to be (away) in the desert among the desert Arabs, asking for news about you, and had they been among you they would not have fought, except a little
In the messenger of Allah, there is indeed a good example for you to follow, for him who expects (to meet) Allah and (the coming of) the period hereafter and remembers Allah much
And when the believers saw the armies of enemies, they said, “This is what Allah and His messenger promised us and Allah and His messenger spoke the truth.” And nothing increased in them except belief and submission
Among the believers are men who are true to the agreement which they made with Allah, so among them is he who has fulfilled his vow and among them is he who waits, and they have not changed (by) changing (themselves)
therefore Allah will reward the truthful for their truth and punish the hypocrites, if He wills, or turn to them (mercifully). Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
And those who did not believe were turned back by Allah in their anger, they did not attain any good, and Allah was sufficient for the believers in the fighting, and Allah is certainly Strong, Mighty
And He brought down those from among the owners of the book who helped the (enemies), from their fortresses, and He cast terror into their hearts, a party (of them) you killed and a party you took as prisoners
And He made you heirs of their land and their houses and their wealth and the land on which you had not (even) put your feet (earlier), and Allah has power over everything
O prophet! say to your wives, “ If you intend (to seek the benefits of) the life of this world and its pomp, then come I will provide for you and let you go a good going away,”
but if you intend (to seek) Allah and His messenger and the home of the hereafter, then Allah has certainly prepared a great reward for those who are doers of good among you.”
O wives of the prophet! whoever among you comes with an open indecency, the punishment will be increased for her (by) doubling (it), and that is easy for Allah
And she among you who is obedient to Allah and His messenger and does righteous work, We will give her twice her reward and We have prepared for her an honored provision
O wives of the prophet! you are not like any other of the women. If you (wish to) guard (against evil), then do not be soft in your speech (when you talk to other men), lest he in whose heart is a disease, (misunderstandingly) hope, but speak (in) words recognized (as good). heart is a disease, (misunderstandingly) hope, but speak (in) words recognized (as good)
And stay in your houses and do not expose yourselves (in the manner of the) exposition of the earlier days of ignorance (before Islam), and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and obey Allah and His messenger. Allah only intends to remove the uncleanliness from you, O people of the house, and clean you (with a good) cleaning
And remember that which is recited in your houses of the signs of Allah and the wisdom (its explanation by the messenger of Allah). Allah is certainly Subtlety Informed
The Muslim men and the Muslim women, and the believing men and the believing women, and the obedient men and the obedient women and the truthful men and the truthful women and the patient men and the patient women, and the humble men and the humble women and the men who give charity and the women who give charity, and the men who fast and the women who fast and the chaste men and the chaste women and the men who remember Allah much and the women who remember; Allah is certainly (ready for their) protective forgiveness and has prepared a great reward for them
It does not befit a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His messenger have decided an affair, to have for themselves any choice in their affair, and he who disobeys Allah and His messenger, has indeed gone astray (into) clear error
And when you said to him (Zaid) whom Allah had favored and whom you (too) had favored, “Retain your wife with you and fear Allah.” And you kept secret in your soul that which Allah was to expose and you did fear human beings while Allah has the greater right that you should fear Him. Then, when Zaid fulfilled the necessary (formalities) of (divorcing) her, We joined her to you in marriage, so that there should be no blame on the believers in marrying the wives of their adopted sons, when they fulfill the necessary (formalities) of (divorcing) them, and the order of Allah was to be executed
And there is no blame on the prophet in (doing) that which Allah has appointed for him. (That was) Allah’s procedure with those who passed away earlier. And the order of Allah is destiny destined
Those who convey the messages of Allah and fear Him, they fear none except Allah. And Allah is sufficient to take account
Muhammed is not the father of any of your men but he is the messenger of Allah and the seal (last) of the prophets , and Allah is the Knower of everything
O you who believe! remember Allah, remembering Him much
and glorify Him morning and evening
He it is Who showers His mercy on you and (also) His angles, so as to bring you out of darkness towards light, and He is merciful to the believers
Their greeting on the day they meet Him will be “Peace,” and He has prepared an honorable reward for them
O prophet! We have certainly sent you as a witness and a conveyer of good news and a warner
and an inviter towards Allah by His permission, and a lamp giving light
And convey good news to the believers that they will have great grace from Allah
And do not obey the infidels and the hypocrites and disregard their annoyances, and put your trust in Allah, and Allah is sufficient as a Trustee
O you who believe! when you marry believing women then divorce them before having touched them, then it is not incumbent on you to count for them the period of (waiting for the next marriage), so provide for them and let them go a good going away. en it is not incumbent on you to count for them the period of (waiting for the next marriage), so provide for them and let them go a good going away
O prophet! We have certainly made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their dowries and those whom your right hand possesses from among the prisoners of war whom Allah has given to you, and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who migrated with you and a believing woman if she gave herself to the prophet, if the prophet (too) intends (to seek) her in marriage, exclusively for you not for the (other) believers, We know what We have appointed for them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess, (this is clarified so) that there should not be any blame on you, and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
You may differ (to invite) whom you will from among them, and you may invite to you whom you will, and there is no sin on you, if you seek (one) of those whom you had (temporarily) set aside (for inviting in future), that is nearer for (providing them with) comfort of their eyes and that they may not grieve and be pleased with that which you give to each one of them; and Allah knows that which is in your hearts and Allah is Knowing, Clement (Kind)
Women beyond these are not lawful for you, nor (is it lawful) that you should change them for other wives, even if their beauty pleased you, except those whom your right hand possesses, and Allah is Vigilant over everything
O you who believe! do not enter the houses of the prophet unless permission is given to you, do not wait for a meal (inside the house) till the time it is cooked, but enter when you are invited and when you have (finished) taking the meal then disperse and do not seek to get involved in conversation, that certainly annoys the prophet but he feels shy of you (to ask you to go) while Allah does not feel shy of the truth. And when you ask the (ladies) for anything, then ask them from behind a curtain, that is cleaner for your hearts and their hearts. And it does not befit you to annoy the messenger of Allah, nor is it (permissible to you) that you should ever marry his wives after him, that is certainly a great (sin) in the sight of Allah
Whether you make anything manifest or keep it a secret, Allah is certainly the Knower of everything
It is no sin for the ladies( to move freely) among their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their brothers’ sons or their sisters’ sons or their own women or whom their right hands possess, but fear Allah, Allah is certainly a Witness over everything
Allah and His angels certainly shower mercy on the prophet, O you who believe! you (too) submissively ask for mercy and peace (to be showered) on him
Those who annoy Allah and His messenger, Allah has certainly cursed them in the world and the hereafter and He has prepared a disgraceful punishment for them
And those who annoy the believing men and the believing women without their having earned (it), then they indeed bear (the burden of) a false charge and a clear sin
O prophet! say to your wives and your daughters and the women among the believers to draw close over themselves (something in the form) of their over garments, that will be better for their being recognized so that they may not be annoyed, and Allah is Protectively, Forgiving, Merciful
If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease and those who spread rumors in the city do not desist, We will definitely make you to be after them, then they will not be your neighbors in it, except (for) a little while
accursed, wherever they are found they will be caught and killed by being murdered
That was the procedure of Allah in (the case of) those who passed away earlier, and you will never find a change in the procedure of Allah
People ask you about the hour of doom, say, “The knowledge about it is only with Allah, and what will make you understand, perhaps the hour of doom is near.”
Allah has certainly cursed the infidels and has prepared a blazing fire for them
in which they will remain for ever. They will find neither a guardian nor a helper
The day their faces will be turned in the fire, they will say, “O would that we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the messenger.”
And they will say, “Our Fosterer! We certainly obeyed our leaders and our great men so they misled us from the way
Our Fosterer! give them double the punishment and curse them with a great curse.”
O you who believe! do not be like those who annoyed Musa, so Allah made him free from that which they said, and he was honorable in the sight of Allah
O you who believe! fear Allah and make statements to the point
He will set right for you your deeds and protectively forgive you your sins, and he who obeys Allah and His messenger, he indeed has achieved a great achievement
We certainly offered the trust (probably the power of decision to obey or not to obey the orders of Allah) to the skies and the earth and the mountains, but they refused to bear it and became afraid of it, and man (undertook the responsibility of) bearing it (but) he was certainly unjust, ignorant
so Allah will punish the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women and the polytheist men and the polytheist women, and Allah will turn (mercifully) to the believing men and the believing women and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Praise is due only for Allah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth. And in the hereafter (too) praise will be due only for Him and He is the Wise, the Informed
He knows that which enters into the earth and that which comes out of it and that which comes down from the sky and that which goes up into it, and He is the Merciful, the Protectively Forgiving
And those who do not believe say, “The hour of doom will not come upon us,” Say, “Why not? By my Fosterer, it will definitely come upon you.”(He is) the Knower of the unseen, not (even) the weight of a particle in the skies or in the earth, nor (something) less than that or greater, is hidden from Him but (it is recorded) in a clear record
that He may reward those who believe and do righteous works, those are the persons for whom is protective forgiveness and an honorable provision
And those who strive against Our signs to frustrate them, those are the persons for whom there is a punishment of painfully weakening uneasiness
And those who are given knowledge see, that what is sent down to you from your Fosterer is the truth and it guides to the path of the Mighty, the Praised
And those who do not believe say, “Should we show you a man who informs you that when you are scattered a total scattering (after death), you will be in a new creation
He has forged a lie against Allah or he is under the influence of a jinn.” No, those who do not believe in the hereafter are (involved) in the punishment, and in error they are far away (from the right path)
Did they not then consider that which is before them (future) and that which is behind them (past) of the sky and the earth? If We will We can cause the earth to sink with them or We can drop on them pieces from the sky. Certainly there is a sign in that for every servant who turns in repentance (to Allah)
And indeed We had given to Dawood grace from Us (ordering): O mountains! echo with him (Allah’s praise) and the birds (too), and We made the iron soft for him
so as to make coats of mail, and measure the links therein, and do righteous work, I am certainly a Seer of what you do
And (We made) the wind (to be under the control) of Sulaiman. Its morning (journey was equal to the journey of) a month and its evening (journey was equal to the journey of) a month and We made a fountain of copper to flow for him (probably in the form of a volcanic eruption) and from among the jinn (We gave him those) who worked before him by the order of his Fosterer, and whoever from among them deviated from Our command, We made him taste (something) from the punishment of blazing fire
They made for him what he willed, of the fortresses and images and bowls like reservoirs and fixed cooking pots. Work! family of Dawood, being grateful and few of My servants are grateful
Then when We decreed death for him, nothing indicated his death to them except a moving creature of the earth which ate away his staff, so when he fell down it was made clear to the jinn, that, had they known the unseen they would not have been remained in the disgraceful punishment (even after his death)
There were indeed a sign for (the people of) Saba in their houses: two gardens on the right and the left, eat of the provision of your Fosterer and be grateful to Him, a good land and a Protectively Forgiving Fosterer
But they turned away (being ungrateful), so We sent on them the tremendous flood and in exchange for their two gardens, We gave to them two (other) gardens yielding bitter fruit and tamarisk and few lote trees. tamarisk and few lote trees
Thus did We reward them because they were ungrateful. And do We reward (in this manner anyone) but the ungrateful
And We had made between them and the towns which We had blessed, easy visibility; and We had apportioned the journey therein: Travel therein by nights and by days, secure
But they said, “Our Fosterer! increase the distance between our journeys,” and they were unjust to themselves, so We made them stories and We scattered them a total scattering. Certainly there are signs in that for every patient, grateful one
And Iblis (the devil) proved true on them his guess, so they followed him except a party of the believers
And he (the devil) has no authority on them, except that (through his instigations to human beings) We (come to ) know (or distinguish) him who believes in the hereafter from him who is in doubt about it, and your Fosterer is a Custodian over everything
Say, “Pray to those besides Allah whom you claim (to be gods or His partners). They do not control (even) the weight of the particle in the skies or in the earth, and they do not have in them both any share, and He does not have among them any helper.”
And no recommendation will be of benefit with Him, except of him whom He will permit. At that point, when horror will be removed from their hearts, they will say, “What did your Fosterer say?” They will say, “The truth.” And He is the High, the Great
Say, “ Who provides you from the skies and the earth?” Say, “Allah, and certainly (either) we or you are on guidance or in clear error.”
Say, “You will not question about our crimes neither will we be questioned about what you do.”
Say, “Our Fosterer will gather us together then He will Judge between us with truth, and He is the judge, the Knowing.”
Say, “Show me those whom you have joined with Him as partners, by no means (are they partners), no it is Allah (Who is), the Mighty, the Wise.”
And We have sent you as a conveyer of good news and a warner to all mankind, but the majority of human beings does not know
And they say, “When will this promise (be fulfilled) if you are truthful?”
Say, “For you is a promised day which you cannot postpone from its (appointed) time nor can you advance (it).”
And those who do not believe say, “We will never believe in this Quran nor in (those books) which were before it.” And if you could see when the unjust will be made to stand before their Fosterer, one turning to the other in argument. Those who were considered weak will say to those who were considered great, “Had it not been for you, we would have been believers.”
Those who were considered great will say to those who were considered weak, “Did we turn you away from the guidance after it had come to you? No, you were criminals.”
And those considered weak will say to those who were considered great, “No, (this happened due to your) planning by night and day, when you commanded us not to believe in Allah and to set up equals with Him.” And they will hide (their) regret when they see the punishment, and We will get the chains tied in the necks of those who did not believe. Will they be rewarded for anything other than that which they used to do
And We did not send a warner to any town, but those who led a luxurious life in it said, “We do not believe in that which you are sent with.”
And they say, “We have more wealth and children than you and we will not be punished.”
Say, “It is my Fosterer Who enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens (it for whomever and whenever He wills), but the majority of human beings certainly does not know.”
Neither your wealth nor your children (are things) through which you (can) come nearer to Us, unless (you are of those) who believe and do righteous work. So those are the persons who will have double the reward because of what they did, and they will be secure in high places
And those who strive against Our signs to frustrate them, those will be made to be present in the punishment
Say, “ (It is) certainly my Fosterer (Who) enlarges the provision for whom He wills and His servants and straitens (it) for him (whenever He wills). And whatever you spend from anything, He replaces it, and He is the Best of providers
And on the day He will gather them all together then say to the angels, “Are these the ones who used to worship you?”
They will say, “Glory be to You, You are our Guardian not they, no, they used to worship the jinn, most of them were believers in them.”
So on that day you will not be able to benefit or harm each other, and We will say to those who were unjust, “Taste the punishment of the fire which you used to deny.”
And when Our clear signs are read to them they say, “He is nothing but a man who intends to turn you away from that which your forefathers worshipped.” And they say, “This is nothing but a forged lie.” And those who do not believe say about the truth when it comes to them, “This is nothing but clear magic.” nothing but clear magic.”
And we did not give them (Meccans) any books which they study nor did We send to them any warner before you
And those before them denied, and these have not reached the tenth of that which We gave to them, yet they denied Our messengers so how was My rejection (of them)
Say, “ I admonish you only for one thing, that you stand in pairs and singly for the sake of Allah then reflect, your companion is not under the influence of a jinn, he is only a warner (sent) to you before a severe punishment.”
Say, “I do not ask you for a reward, but ( that which I ask you to do) is for your (benefit, the responsibility of) rewarding me (rests on none) but Allah and He is a Witness over everything.”
Say, “My Fosterer certainly strikes through the truth, Great Knower of the unseen.”
Say, “The truth has come and nothing is originated or reproduced by falsehood.”
Say, “ If I err, I err only against my own soul and if I am guided then it is because of that which my Fosterer has communicated to me, He is certainly Hearing, Near.”
And if you could only see when they are horrified, then there will be no escape, and they will be caught from a near place
And they will say, “We believe in it.” But how can they seek (to believe) from such a distant place
when they did not believe init earlier? And they strike (guesses) regarding the unseen, from a distance place
And a barrier will be placed between them and that which they desire, as was done with the parties (like) them earlier, they certainly used to be in doubt causing restlessness
Praise is due only for Allah the Initiator of creation of the skies and the earth, Maker of the angels messengers, possessors of wings (forces) two and three and four, He increases in the creation what He wills, Allah certainly has power over everything
That which Allah opens for mankind from (His) mercy, there is no withholder for it, and that which He withholds, there is no releaser for it other than Him, and He is the Mighty the Wise
O mankind! remember the favor of Allah on you. Is there a creator other than Allah who provides you from the sky and the earth? There is no god except Him, then how are you turned away (form the truth)
And if you are denied, then messengers before you were indeed denied, and (all) the affairs are returned to Allah
O mankind! Allah’s promise is certainly true, so do not let the life of this world deceive you and do not let the deceiver (devil) deceive you about Allah
The devil is certainly your enemy, so take him as an enemy, he invites his party (with the sole purpose) that they should be among the inhabitants of the blazing fire
For those who do not believe there is a severe punishment, and those who believe and do righteous works, for them there is protective forgiveness and a great reward
Then, is he to whom the evil of his deed is made fair seeming, so that he sees it (as) good, (like one, who is really good)? So Allah certainly leaves to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let your soul waste away regretting over them. Allah is certainly the Knower of the work they do. e, who is really good)? So Allah certainly leaves to stray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So do not let your soul waste away regretting over them. Allah is certainly the Knower of the work they do
And it is Allah Who sends the winds, so that they raise the cloud, then We drive it to a dead land and We give life through it to the earth after its death. (your) resurrection will (also) be like that
Whoever intends to be might then (let him know that) the mighty is totally Allah’s. To Him ascend the good statements and He elevates the righteous work. And those who plan evil deeds, for them there is a severe punishment and the planning of those will be lost
And Allah created you from the soil then from the sperm, then He made you pairs, and no female carries or lays down but with His knowledge. And nothing is lengthened in life nor anything is reduced from one’s life, but (the length of life is written) in a record. This is certainly easy for Allah
And the two seas are not equal, one quenches thirst, sweet, pleasant to drink and the other saltish, bitter; and from each you eat fresh flesh and take out ornaments which you wear; and you see the ships cleave through it that you may seek of His grace and that you may be grateful
He makes the night to enter into the day and He makes the day to enter into the night and He compelled the sun and the moon (to follow His laws), each moves fast for an appointed term. That is Allah your Fosterer, His is the kingdom. And those whom you pray to, besides Him, do not own (even) the white spot on a date stone
If you call them they will not hear your call, and even if they could hear they will not respond to you, and on the day of resurrection they will reject your (associating them as) partners (with Allah), and none can give you news like the One Informed
O Mankind! you are the ones who are in need of Allah while Allah is Independent, the Praised
If He wills He can remove you and bring in a new creation
and that is not a mighty (thing) for Allah
And a bearer of burden will not bear the burden of another (person) and if one heavy with burden calls (someone) for carrying it, none will carry anything of it even though he be a relative. You can warn only those who fear their Fosterer unseen and establish worship (salat). And whoever purifies himself, he purifies himself only for (the benefit of) his own soul and towards Allah is the destination
And the blind and the seeing are not equal
nor the darkness and the light
nor the shade and the heat
And the living and the dead are not equal. Allah certainly makes to listen, whom He wills and you cannot make to listen, those who are in the graves
You are nothing but a warner
We have certainly sent you with the truth as a conveyer of good news and a warner and there has been no community but a warner has passed among them
And if you are denied by them, then those before them (also) denied. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs and with scriptures and with the book giving light
Then I caught those who rejected. So how was My rejection (of them)
Did you not see that Allah sends down the water from the sky, then We bring out fruits of different colors? And in the mountains there are white and red layers, (and others) of different colors and (still others) intensely black
And among mankind and (other) living beings and the cattle (too), their colors are different likewise. Only those among His servants fear Allah who have knowledge. Allah is certainly Mighty, Protectively Forgiving
Those who read (to follow) the book of Allah and establish worship (salat) and spend secretly and openly from that which We have provided them, they certainly hope for a commerce (in which) there will never be a loss
because He will repay them in full their rewards and give them more out of His grace. He is certainly Protectively Forgiving, One Who acknowledges
And that which we have communicated to you of the books, is the truth confirming (the book) which were before it. Allah is certainly informed of His servants, Seeing (them)
Then We made those to inherit the book, whom We chose from among Our servants. So among them are those who are unjust to their own souls and among them are those who are moderate and among them are those who are foremost in good deeds by the order of Allah, that is the great grace (of Allah)
gardens of everlasting bliss which they will enter, they will be made to wear therein bracelets of gold and pearls and their garments therein will be (of) silk
And they will say, “Praise is due only for Allah Who has removed grief from us, Our Fosterer is certainly Protectively Forgiving, One Who acknowledges
Who has made us alight in an eternal home out of His grace, neither toil will touch us therein nor will fatigue touch us therein.”
And those who do not believe, for them is the fire of hell, it will neither bring the end of them that they may die, nor (something) of its punishment be lightened on them, thus will We reward every infidel
And therein they will cry for help, “Our Fosterer! take us out, we will do righteous work, other than that which we used to do.” (They will be answered). “ Did We not keep you alive to the extent that he who wanted to be mindful in it could have been mindful? And the warner (too) came to you, so taste (the penalty), and for those who are unjust there is no helper.”
Allah is certainly the Knower of the unseen of the skies and the earth, He is certainly the Knower of that which is in the bosoms
He it is Who has made you successors in the earth. So he who does not believe, on him is (the responsibility of) his infidelity, and their infidelity does not increase for the infidels, in the sight of their Fosterer, anything but hatred, and their infidelity does not increase for the infidels anything but loss
Say, “Have you considered your (presumed) partners (of Allah) whom you pray to, besides Allah? Show me what they have created from the earth or is there a partnership for them in the skies?” Or have We given them a book so that they are on a clear proof from it. No, the unjust do not promise each other but to decevice
Allah certainly holds together the skies and the earth lest they get separated and if they get separated, no one other than Him can hold both of them together. He is certainly Clement, Protectively Forgiving
And they swore by Allah the strongest of their oaths, that if a warner came to them they would definitely be better guided than any of the (other) communities, but when a warner came to them, it did not increase in them anything but hatred
They consider themselves great in the earth and plan evil, and the evil plan does not engulf anyone except the authers of it. So do they wait for anything, except the procedure (in which) the ancients (were treated)? Then you will never find a change in the procedure of Allah and you will never find an alteration in the procedure of Allah
Did they not travel in the earth and see how the end of those before them was (brought about)? And they were severer than them in strength. And Allah is not such that anything in the skies or in the earth could frustrate Him. He is certainly Knowing, Powerful
And if Allah were to catch human beings for that which they earned (of sin), He would not have left on the surface of the (earth, any) of the moving creatures, but He gives them time till an appointed term, but when their term comes (to an end, He will catch them) because Allah is certainly One Who sees His servants
Yaa Siin
By the Quran full of wisdom
you are certainly (one) of the messengers
on the straight path
(The Quran is) sent down by the Mighty, the Merciful
that you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned so they are heedless
The word has indeed proved true on most of them so they do not believe
We have placed chains round their necks and they are right up to the chins, so their heads are raised
and We have made a barrier before them and a barrier behind them, then We have covered them, therefore they are not able to see
And it is equal to them whether you warn them or do not warn them, they will not believe
You can warn only him who follows the reminder and fears the Beneficent (Allah) without having seen Him, so convey to him the good news of protective forgiveness and an honourable reward
We certainly give life to the dead and record the (deeds) which they send before (in advance) and their footprints (work which they leave behind) and We have computed everything in a clear guide (book of deeds)
And set forth to them the similitude of the inhabitants of the town, when messengers came to it
when We sent to them two, they denied them both, therefore We strengthened (them) with a third, so they said, “We are messengers (sent) to you.”
They said, “You are nothing but men like us and the Beneficent (Allah) has not sent down anything, you do nothing but lie.”
They said, “Our Fosterer knows that we are certainly messengers (sent) to you
and there is no (responsibility) on us except clear conveyance (of the message).”
They said, “We consider you to be an evil omen, if you do not desist we will definitely stone you and you will definitely be afflicted by a painful punishment from us.”
They said, “(Let) your evil omens be with you. What! (you resist us just) because you are reminded, no, you are an extravagant people.”
And a man came running from a distant (part) of the city, he said, “O my people! follow the messengers
follow those who do not ask you for a reward and who are themselves guided
And what reason do I have not to serve Him Who initiated my creation, and to Him you will be returned
What! should I take gods besides Him, whose recommendation will not make me free from anything, if the Beneficent (Allah) intends harm, nor will they save me
Then, in that case, I will certainly be in clear error
I have believed in your Fosterer, so listen to me.”
It was said, “Enter the garden.” He said, “I wish my people could know
(the reason) because of which my Fosterer protectively forgave me and placed me among the honoured ones.”
And after him, We did not send down on his people, any army from the sky, and it was not (necessary) for Us to send
it was nothing but a single loud cry when they became motionless
(Let there be) regret on My servants, there does not come to them any messenger but they mock at him
Did they not consider, how many of the generations did We destroy before them which do not come back to them
And all of them, without exception, will be presented before Us
And a sign to them is the dead earth, We give life to it and bring out from it grain so they eat of it
And We have made therein gardens of date palms and grapes and We have caused the springs to gush forth therein
that they may eat of its fruit, and their hands did not make it. Will they not then be grateful
Glory be to Him Who created pairs of everything, of that which the earth grows and of themselves and of that which they do not know
And a sign for them is the night, We cause the day to slip off from it, when (again) they are in darkness
And the sun moves on for the time (and) in the space (appointed for) it. That is the programme of the Mighty, the Knowing
And the moon, We have programmed for it stages (in space and time) till it returns like an old dry palm branch
Neither it is possible for the sun to catch (up with) the moon, nor can the night outstrip the day and each moves fast in an orbit
And a sign for them is that We carried their progeny in the loaded ship
And We created for them (vessels) similar to it, on which they ride
And if We will We can drown them, then there will be no one (to respond) to their cry for help nor will they be saved
but (if this does not happen, it is due to) the mercy from Us and a provision till a time
And (they are heedless) when it is said to them, “Guard (yourselves against) that which is before you and that which is behind you that you may be dealt with mercifully.”
And there does not come to them any sign from the signs of their Fosterer but they turn away from it
And when it is said to them, “Spend from that which Allah has provided for you,” those who do not believe say to those who believe, “Should we feed him, whom Allah (Himself) could feed, if He wills? You are in nothing but clear error.”
And they say, “When will the promise (be fulfilled) if you are truthful?”
They do not wait for anything but a single loud cry which will take hold of them while they are (involved) in a tussle with each other
so that they will neither be able to make a bequest nor will they be able to return to their own people
And it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe) when they will rush forth from their graves towards their Fosterer
saying, “Sorrowful is our state, who has raised us from our sleeping place? This is what the Beneficent (Allah) had promised and the messengers had spoken the truth.”
It will be nothing but a single loud cry when all of them will be presented before Us
So on that day, no soul will be dealt with unjustly in anything and you will not be rewarded for anything but for that which you used to do
On that day, the inhabitants of the garden will certainly be in a joyful occupation
they and their mates (will be) in shades, reclining on couches
For them there will be fruits and for them (there will be) what they ask for
‘Peace,’ (will be) the word from the Merciful Fosterer
(Allah will say), “Separate on this day, O you criminals
Had I not enjoined on you, O children of Adam! that you should not serve the devil, (as) he is your open enemy
and that you should serve Me, this is the straight path
And he had indeed led astray a large group of people from among you, then were you not having sense
This is the hell you were threatened with
enter it this day, because you did not believe.”
This day We will put a seal on their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us and their feet will bear witness of that which they used to earn
And if We will We could wipe off their eyes, then they would strive for the path, but how will they be able to see
And if We will We could transform them in their places, then they would not be able to go forward or to return
And he to whom We give a long life, We reverse him in creation (instead of growing he starts decaying). Do they not then understand
And We have not taught him (Muhammed) poetry and it is not suitable for him, it is nothing but a reminder and a Quran (that makes things) clear
that he who is alive may be warned and the word may be proved true against the infidels
Did they not see that We have created the cattle for them, among that which Our hands have done, then they are their masters
And We have subdued them for their (use), so among them are (some on) whom they ride and (some) of them they eat
And they have (other) benefits in them and drinks. Will they not then be grateful
And they have taken gods besides Allah that they may be helped
They are not capable of helping them, and they (their false gods, supposed to be a) force for them, will (also) be presented (before Allah)
So do not let their speech grieve you, We know that which they keep secret and that which they make public
H as not man considered that We created him from a sperm* even then he is an open disputant. * See note no. 1 of chapter 16, Verse
And he strikes a similitude for Us and forgets his own creation, saying, “Who will give life to the bones when they are decomposed?”
Say, “He will give life to them Who produced them the first time and He knows every (kind of) creation
He it is Who made the fire for you from the green trees, so that you get your fuel from it
Is not He Who created the skies and the earth, able to create the like of them, why not? And He is the Great Creator Who knows
His command, when He intends anything, is that He says to it only, ‘Be’, so it is.”
So glory be to Him in Whose hand is the kingdom of everything and to Him you will be returned
By those who rank themselves in ranks
then those who restrain, restraining
then those who read a reminder
Your God is certainly One
Fosterer of the skies and the earth and that which is between them both, Fosterer of the rising places and times of the sun
We have certainly adorned the sky of the world with an adornment, the planets
and (provided) protection from every rebellious devil
they cannot listen to the high assembly and they are struck from every side
being driven away, and for them there is an everlasting punishment
except him who snatches a snatching, then a piercing flame* follows him. * Meteorite which sometimes make a hole in the earth
So ask them whether their creation is difficult or (of those others) whom We created, We certainly created them from sticking clay
No, you wonder while they mock
And when they are reminded they do not mind
And when they see a sign they seek to mock
And they say, “This is nothing but clear magic
What! when we die and become (part of the) soil and bones, will we (then) be raised
and our forefathers (too)?”
Say, “Yes and you will be humbled.”
So it will only be a single loud scolding to drive them out, when they will see
and say, “ Sorrowful is our state, this is the day of judgment.”
(It will be said,) “ This is the day of separation which used to denied by you.”
Gather those who were unjust and their mates (too), and that which they used to serve (worship)
besides Allah, then lead them to the path of hell
And stop them for they will be questioned
“What is the matter with you that you do not help each other?”
No, they will seek submission on that day
and some of them will turn to others questioning each other
saying, “You certainly used to come to us from the right (with full force to mislead us).”
(Others will) say, “No, you (only) did not believe
and we had no authority on you, no, you were (yourselves)a rebellious people
so the word of our Fosterer has proved true on us, we will certainly taste (the punishment)
we led you astray because we were ourselves astray.”
So on that day they will be sharers in the punishment
Thus do We deal with the criminals
When it was said to them, “There is no god except Allah,” they certainly used to consider themselves great (to accept this)
And they say, “Shall we give up our gods for the sake of a poet under the influence of the jinn?”
No, he has come with the truth and confirms the messengers (who had come before him)
You will certainly taste the painful punishment
and you will not be rewarded except for that which you used to do
except the servants, exclusively of Allah
For them there will be a known provision
fruits, and they will be honoured
in gardens of bliss
on couches facing each other
A cup from a spring (of a drink) will be made to go round among them
white, delicious for the drinkers
There will be no unconsciousness due to it nor will they be intoxicated by it
And with them will be (females) who restrain their gaze, having beautiful eyes
as if they were protected eggs
Then some of them will turn to others questioning
a speaker among them will say, “I had a comrade of mine
who used to say: Are you of those who confirm
that when we die and become(part of the) soil and bones, we will indeed be brought for judgment?”
(Someone will) say, “Would you peep (to see him)?”
So he will peep, then see him in the midst of hell
He will say , “By Allah, you had almost destroyed me
and had the favor of my Fosterer not been there, I (too) would have been (with you) among those presented (for punishment).”
(The inhabitants of the garden will say), “Then is it that we will not die
except our first death, and we will not be among those who are punished
This certainly is a great achievement.”
So let those who (wish to) work, work for (something) like this
Is this a better entertainment or the tree of Zaqqum
We have made it an affliction for those who are unjust
It is a tree that comes out from the bottom of the hell
Its produce resembles in likeness, the heads of devils
So they will eat from it then fill their stomachs with it
then they will have a drink of boiling water over that
Then their return will be to hell
They certainly found their fathers astray
so they follow their footsteps, being in haste
And the majority of the ancients before them, indeed went astray
and We had indeed sent warners among them
so see how the end of those warned was (brought about)
except the servants, exclusively of Allah
And Nuh prayed to Us, and We are Excellent Responders
so We saved him and his followers from the great distress
and We caused his descendants to be of those who survived
and We left on him (the responsibility of conveying Our message) among others
Peace on Nuh in the worlds
Thus do We reward the doers of good
He was certainly among Our believing servants
Then We drowned the others
And Ibrahim was certainly of his sect
when he came to his Fosterer with a defect less heart
When he said to his father and his people, “What do you worship
Do you intend to worship false gods besides Allah
So what is your guess about the Fosterer of the worlds?”
Then he looked (with a searching) look at the stars (probably because his people worshipped the stars too and)
then he said, “I am certainly sick.”
So his people turned their backs upon him and went away
Then he turned towards their (false) gods and said, “Why do you not eat
What is (wrong) with you that you do not speak?”
So he turned against them striking with his right hand
Then they came hastening towards him in confrontation
He said, “What! do you worship that which you (yourselves) carve
while Allah has created you and that which you do?”
They said, “Build a building (furnace) for him then put him into the fire.”
So they intended (to lay down) a plot against him but We made them the lower most
And he said, “I will certainly go away (from these people) towards my Fosterer, He will guide me
My Fosterer! grant me from among the righteous.”
So We conveyed to him the good news of a gentle son
Then when he reached (the age of) striving with him, he said, “O my son! I saw in my sleep (dream) that I am slaying you (as a sacrifice), then see, what do you consider (about it)?” He said. “O My father! do what you have been commanded (to do), if Allah wills, you will find me (to be) of the patient ones.”
Then, when they both submitted and he (Ibrahim) laid him down on his forehead, (at that moment)
We called out to him, “O Ibrahim
you have proved true the vision (by obeying in reality the order given to you through your dream so you need not sacrifice your son) thus do We reward the doers of good
this was nothing but a clear trail.”
And We ransomed him with a great slaughter (sacrifice of a sheep)
And We left on him (the responsibility of conveying Our message) among others
Peace on Ibrahim
Thus do We reward the doers of good
He was certainly among Our believing servants
And We conveyed to him the good news of Ishaq, a prophet, from among the righteous
And We showered Our blessings on him and on Ishaq. And among their descendents are those who do good and (also) those who are clearly unjust to their own souls
And We bestowed Our favor on Musa and Harun
and We saved both of them and their people from the great distress
and We helped them so they were the victors
And We gave them the book that made (things) clear
and We guided them both to the straight path
And We left on them both (the responsibility of conveying Our message) among others
Peace on Musa and Harun
Thus do We reward the doers of good
They both were among Our believing servants
And Ilyas was certainly from among the messengers
When he said to his people, “Why do you not guard (against evil)
Why do you pray to Baal (the false sun god presumed by you) and forsake (Allah) the Best of proportioners
Allah is your Fosterer and the Fosterer of your forefathers.”
But they denied him, so they certainly be presented (for punishment)
except the servants, exclusively of Allah
And We left on him, (the responsibility of conveying Our message) among others
Peace on Ilyaasiin
Thus do We reward the doers of good
He was certainly among Our believing servants
And Lut was certainly from among Our messengers
when We saved him and his followers all together
except an old woman (who was) among those who remained behind
then We destroyed the others
And you certainly pass by their (ruins) during the day
and during the night. Do you not then understand
And Yunus was certainly from among Our messengers
when he fled to the loaded ship
then drew lots but was among those who were slipped off (from the ship)
then the fish swallowed him and he was blameworthy
And had he not been among those who glorify (Allah)
he would have remained in its stomach till the day they are raised
Then We cast him on the naked shore while he was sick
and We caused a tree of gourd to grow over him
And We sent him to more than a hundred thousand (people)
so they believed, therefore We made them enjoy till a time
Then ask them, “Are there daughters for your Fosterer and for them sons
Or did We create the angels females while they were witnesses?”
Is it not from their own devised falsehood that they say (that)
Allah has a son? And they are certainly liars
Has He chosen daughters (in preference to) sons
What is (wrong) with you, how do you judge
Will you not then mind
Or have you a clear authority
Then come with your book if you are truthful
And they assign a relationship between Him and the jinn and the jinn know that they will be presented (before Him)
glorified be Allah (He is far) from that which they describe
except the servants, exclusively of Allah
So you and that which you serve (worship)
you cannot mislead (anyone) against Him
except him who is to enter hell
And there is no one among us, but there is a known place for him
and we are certainly those set in ranks
and we are certainly those who glorify
And they used to say
“Had we with us, a reminder of the ancients
we would have definitely been servants, exclusively of Allah.”
But (now) they do not believe in this (Quran), so they will know
And Our word has already gone forth in respect of Our servants, the messengers
that they will certainly be helped
And Our forces, they will be victors
So turn away from them till a time
and keep seeing them, for they (too) will see
Do they seek to hasten on Our punishment
But when it comes down in their court, then evil will be the morning of those warned
And turn away from them till a time
and keep seeing, for they (too) will see
Glorified be your Fosterer, Lord of Might, (He is far) from that which they describe
and peace on the messengers
and praise is due only for Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds
Saad. By the Quran that contains admonition
No, those who do not believe (consider themselves) among the mighty and are in opposition
How many of the generations did We destroy before them, so that they cried out, but that was not the time for escape
And they wonder that a warner has come to them from among themselves. And the infidels say, “This is a magician, a liar
Has he made (all) the gods (into) One God? This is certainly a wonderful thing.”
And the leaders from among them go away (fast, saying) that, “Walk away (from here), and patiently adhere to your gods, this is certainly the thing that is intended
We have not heard of this among other communities, this is nothing but something invented (by him)
Has the reminder been sent down on him of (all the persons) among us?” No, they are in doubt about My reminder, no, they have not yet tasted My punishment
Or are there with them, the treasures of the mercy of your Fosterer, the Mighty, the One Who grants
Or is the kingdom of the skies and the earth and that which is between them, theirs? Then let them rise into the ways (of the sky)
There! (among them is) an army of the parties which will be defeated
Before them the people of Nuh and Aad and Firawn, the possessor of pegs (of his kingdom firmly established), denied
And Samood and people of Lut and the inhabitants of the jungle, those (too) were the parties (defeated earlier)
There was not one (of them) who did not deny the messengers, so (they became) deserving of My retributional (punishment)
And they do not wait for anything but a single loud cry, for which there will be no pause
And they say, “Our Fosterer! hasten on to us our portion before the day of account.”
Be patient on that which they say. And remember Our servant Dawood the possessor of power, he was certainly one turning (repentantly to Allah)
We had certainly subjected the mountains to glorify (Allah) with him in the evening and at sun rise
And the birds gathered, all returning to him
And We made his kingdom strong and We gave him wisdom and (the power of) decision of affairs
And has the news of the disputants come to you, when they climbed the wall of the private chamber
when they entered before Dawood, and he was horrified of them? They said, “Do not fear, we are two disputants, one of us has wronged the other, so decide between us with justice and do not act unjustly and guide us to the balanced path
This brother of mine, certainly has ninety and nine ewes and I have (only) one ewe, so he says: Entrust it to me; and shows his might on me in the affair.”
He (Dawood) said, “He has been unjust to you by demanding your ewe (to be added) to his ewes and many of the partners certainly wrong one another, except those who believe and do righteous works, and their (number) is small.” And Dawood guessed that We had tested him, so he sought the protective forgiveness of his Fosterer and fell down bowing and turned (to Allah)
So We protectively forgave him that, and certainly, with Us is nearness for him and a beautiful place of return
O Dawood! We have made you a successor (to rule) in the earth so judge between mankind with justice and do not follow (your) desire lest it lead you astray from the way of Allah. Those who go astray from the way of Allah, for them there is certainly a severe punishment because they forgot the day of account
And We did not create the sky and the earth and whatever is between them in vain, that is the opinion of those who do not believe, so sorrowful will be the state of those who do not believe, due to the fire
Shall We make those who believe and do righteous works like those who cause corruption in the earth? Shall We make those who keep themselves in limits like those who exceed the limits
A blessed book which We have sent down to you that they may reflect over its signs and that those who understand may be mindful
And We granted to Dawood, Sulaiman an excellent servant, he was certainly of those who turned (to Allah)
When (horses of high breed, which were) still when standing and swift while running, were presented to him in the evening, the evening
he said, “ I certainly preferred the love of good things to the remembrance of my Fosterer, to the extent that the (sun) was hidden behind the veil
bring them back to me, “ then he began to pass his hand over (their) legs and necks
And We indeed tried Sulaiman and We put on his throne a body, then he turned (to Allah)
He said, “ My Fosterer! protectively forgive me and grant me (such) a kingdom (the like of) which will not be possible for anyone (to have) after me. You are certainly the One Who grants.”
So We subjected to his (service) the wind, to move softly by his command, to which ever place he desired
and the devils, every builder and diver
and others linked together in chains
This is Our gift, so show favor or withhold, without account
And certainly, with Us is nearness for him and a beautiful place of return
And mention (about) Our servant Iyub, when he prayed to his Fosterer, “The devil has afflicted me with toil and torment.”
(It was said to him), “Strike with your foot, this (water which thereby gushes out, is for a) cool bath and a drink.”
And We granted to him his people and the like of them along with them, a mercy from Us and a reminder for men of understanding
(It was further said), “Take in your hand a bundle of twigs (of herbs) then strike with it and do not disobey. We certainly found him patient, an excellent servant, he was certainly one who turned (to Allah)
And mention (about) Our servants Ibrahim and Ishaq and Yaqub men of strength and insight
We had purified them for the exclusive reminding of the home (of the hereafter)
And they are with Us, among those chosen from the doers of good
And mention (about) Ismael and Elisha and Zul Kifl and all were from among the doers of good
This is a reminder, and for those who guard (against evil), there is a beautiful place of return
gardens of everlasting bliss, the doors of which will be kept open for them
reclining therein, they will therein call for many fruits and drinks
and with them will be females of equal age who restrain their gaze
This is what you are promised for the day of account
This is Our provision for which there is certainly no end
(It will be like) this. But for the rebels, there is certainly an evil place of return
hell, they will enter it, and (it will be) an evil habitation
(It will be like) this. So let them taste the boiling water and pus
and other (punishments) similar to it in kind
This is an army rushing blindly with you, there is no welcome for them, they will certainly enter the fire
They will say (to those already in hell), “No, no welcome for you (too), you prepared this in advance for us, so evil is the place /time of stay.”
They (will continue to) say, “Our Fosterer! he who prepared this in advance for us, increase for him the punishment in the fire (by) doubling (it).”
And they will say, “What is wrong with us that we do not see the men whom we counted among the evil ones
did we take them in ridicule (by mistake) or have our eyes turned away from them (that we do not see them in hell)?”
That mutual dispute of the dwellers of the fire will certainly be true
Say, “I am only a warner and there is no god except Allah, the One, the Omnipotent
Fosterer of the skies and the earth and whatever is between them, the Mighty, the Protectively Forgiving.”
Say, “It is a great news
from which you are turning away
I do not have any knowledge of the high assembly when they dispute
nothing is communicated to me except that I am a clear warner.”
When your Fosterer said to the angels, “I am creating man from clay
so when I set him up in equilibrium and I blow into him from My spirit, then fall bowing down before him.”
So the angels bowed down, all of them together
except Iblis, he considered himself great and became (one) of the infidels
He (Allah) said, “O Iblis! what prevented you from bowing down before him whom I created with my hands? Did you consider yourself great or are you of those who are high (exalted)?”
He said, “I am better than him, You created me from fire (i.e. energy), whereas You created him from clay (i.e. matter).”
He said, “Get out from here, for you are certainly accursed
and My curse is certainly on you till the day of judgment.”
He said, “My Fosterer! give me time till the day they are raised.”
He said, “You are of those who are given time
till the day, the timing of which is known.”
He said, “Then by Your might, I will definitely lead them astray, all together,”
except (those) among them (who are) exclusively Your servants.”
He said, “Then (let this be) the truth, and I speak the truth
that I will definitely fill hell with you and those who follow you from among them , all together.”
Say, “I do not ask you for any reward for it and I am not of those who pretend
This is nothing but a reminder for the worlds
and you will definitely come to know (the truth of) the news (given) in it, after a time.”
The sending down of the books is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise
We have sent down to you the book containing the truth, so serve Allah making religion exclusively for Him
Beware! religion is exclusively for Allah. And those who have taken guardians besides Him (say); “We do not serve (worship) them, except (with the aim) that they may bring us nearer to Allah,” Allah will certainly judge between them in that which they differ. Allah certainly does not guide him who is a liar, ungrateful
Had Allah intended to take a son, He could have chosen whom He willed from among those whom He created, Glory be to Him, He is Allah, the One, the Omnipotent
He created the skies and the earth in reality. He winds the night over the day and He winds the day over the night (which indicates that the earth rotates). And He has compelled the sun and the moon (to follow His laws), each one moves on for an appointed term. Beware! He is the Mighty, the Protectively Forgiving. the Protectively Forgiving
He created you from a single soul then He made from it, its mate, and He send down for you eight pairs of cattle. He creates you in the womb of your mothers, creation after creation in triple darkness. This is Allah your Fosterer, His is the kingdom, there is no god except Him. How then are you turned away
If you are ungrateful, then Allah is certainly Independent of you, and He does not like ingratitude for His servants and if you are grateful, He likes it for you. And no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another, then towards your Fosterer is your return and He will inform you about that which you used to do, He is certainly the Knower of what the bosoms possess
And when harm afflicts man, he prays to his Fosterer turning towards Him, then when He grants to him favor from Him, he forgets (even) that for which he had prayed to Him earlier, and sets up equals for Allah that he may mislead (people) from His way. Say, “Enjoy a little in your ingratitude, you will certainly be among the inhabitants of the fire.”
Is he who devoutly prostrates and stands (for worship) during the hours of night, being cautious of the hereafter, and hopes for the mercy of his Fosterer (equal to one who does not do this)? Say, “Are those who know and those who do not know equal?” Only men of understanding are mindful
Say, “O servants (of Allah) who believe! fear your Fosterer. For those who do good in this world is good and the earth of Allah is vast. Only those who are patient will be paid back their reward without measure.”
Say, “I am commanded that I should serve Allah, making religion exclusively for Him
and I am commanded that I should be the first of those who submit (as Muslims).”
Say, “I fear the punishment of the great day, if I disobey my Fosterer.”
Say, “I serve Allah, making my religion exclusively for Him
so you serve (worship) that which you will (to serve) besides Him. “Say, ‘The losers are certainly those who cause loss to themselves and their people on the day of resurrection. Beware! that is a clear loss.”
For them there will be coverings of fire from above them and coverings from below them. Allah makes His servants fear through that. O My servants! then fear Me
And those who keep away from serving (worshipping) false deities and turn towards Allah, for them is good news, so convey the good news to My servants
who hear a statement then follow the best of it, those are the persons whom Allah has guided and those are the persons who understand
Then if there is a person on whom the stated punishment is due, then can you save him who is in the fire
But those who fear their Fosterer, for them are built high palaces above which are (still) higher palaces (multistoried buildings), beneath which rivers flow, a promise of Allah, Allah does not go against His promise
Did you not see, that Allah sends down water from the sky then makes it move as springs in the earth, then brings out through it vegetation of different colors, then it dries up, then you see it become yellow, then He makes it pieces? There is certainly a reminder in that for men of understanding
Then is he, whose bosom Allah has opened for Islam so that he is (guided) by the light from his Fosterer, (like him who is in darkness)? So sorrowful is the state of those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah, they are in a clear error
Allah has sent down the best statements (in the form of) a book, (these statements are) similar (to each other and not contradictory and are) repeated. The skins of those who fear their Fosterer tremble (in response to the effect produced) by it, then their skins and their hearts soften towards the remembrance of Allah. That is guidance of Allah, He guides through it whom He wills, and whom Allah leaves to stray then there is no guide for him
Then is he, who will have to guard the evil punishment of the day of resurrection from his face, (like him who is safe from it)? And it will be said to those who were unjust, “Taste that which you earned.”
Those before them (had also) denied, so they did not perceive from where the punishment came to them
Thus Allah made them taste disgrace in the life of this world and the punishment of the hereafter is greater, if only they knew
And We have set forth for mankind, every (kind) of similitude in this Quran that they may be mindful
An Arabic Quran without any crookedness, that they may guard (against evil)
Allah sets forth the example of a man who is under (the control of many) partners differing with each other, and (another) man wholly (under the control) of one man, are the two equal in likeness? Praise is due only for Allah, no, the majority of them does not know
You will certainly die and they (too) will certainly die
then on the day of resurrection, you will certainly dispute one with another in the presence of your Fosterer
Then who is more unjust than he who speaks a lie against Allah and denies the truth when it comes to him? Will not the home for the infidels be in hell? in hell
And he who comes with truth and he who testifies it, those are the persons who guard (against evil)
for them, with their Fosterer, is what they will (for), that is the reward of the doers of good
because Allah will remove from them (the ill effect of even) the worst of that which they did, and reward them with their reward (which will be) better than that which they used to do
Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? And they frighten you with those besides Him, and whom Allah leaves to stray, then there is no guide for him
And whom Allah guides, then there is none who can mislead him. Is not Allah Mighty, Inflicter of retribution
And if you ask them, “Who created the skies and the earth?” Then will definitely say, “Allah.” Say, “They have you considered that which you pray to, besides Allah, if Allah intends to harm me, could they remove from me His harm, or if He intends to be merciful to me, could they withhold from me His mercy?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me, those who put their trust, do put their trust in Him.”
Say, “O my people! work according to your ability, I (too) am working, so you will come to know
on whom will the punishment come, which will disgrace him, and on whom will fall the eternal punishment.”
We have sent down to you the book containing the truth, for mankind, so one who receives guidance, then (the benefit of) it is for his ownself, and one who goes astray, then (the loss of) his going astray is only on him, and you are not a trustee over them
Allah takes the souls (i.e. consciousness of human beings) at the time of their death, and (He takes the soul) of the person who does not die, during his sleep, then He withholds that on which He has decreed death and sends (back) the others till an appointed term. Certainly there are signs in that for a people who reflect. which He has decreed death and sends (back) the others till an appointed term. Certainly there are signs in that for a people who reflect
Have they taken (for worship, things) besides Allah, (for) the purpose of mediation? Say, “Even if they have no control on anything and have no sense?”
Say, “(The power to grant permission for) mediation is totally Allah’s. His is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, then towards Him you will be returned.”
And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the hereafter, get bored and when those besides Him are mentioned, at that moment they become joyful
Say, “O Allah! Initiator of the creation of the skies and earth, Knower of the unseen and the seen, You will judge between Your servants regarding that in which they differ.”
And if those who are unjust, had all that is in the earth and the like of it with it, they would give it as ransom (to free themselves) through it from the evil punishment of the day of resurrection. And (something) from Allah, which they had not (even) thought of, will become manifest to them
And the evil which they had earned will become manifest to them, and that which they used to mock at, will surround them
So when harm afflicts man he prays to Us, then when We grant to him a favor from Us, he says, “This has been given to me only on the (account of my) knowledge.” No, it is a trail, but majority of them does not know
Those before them had (also) said it, but that which they used to earn did not make them carefree from (the consequences of their evil deeds)
so that the evil of that which they earned afflicted them. And those who are unjust from among these, the evil of that which they earn will afflict them (too), and they will not be able to defeat (Allah). defeat (Allah)
Do they not know that Allah enlarges the provision for whomever He wills and straitens (it for whomever and whenever He wills). Certainly there are signs in that for a people who believe
Say, “O My servants who have committed excesses against their own souls! do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Allah certainly protectively forgives all the sins, He is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful.”
And turn towards your Fosterer and submit to Him before the punishment comes to you, then you will not be helped
And follow the best which is sent down to you from your Fosterer before the punishment comes to you suddenly while you do not perceive
lest a soul should say, “My regrets on being negligent towards Allah’s side, and I was of those who mocked,”
or say, “If Allah has guided me I (too) would have been among those who guarded (against evil),”
or say at the time it sees the punishment, “Had there been a second chance for me (to go back to the world, then) I would be of those who do good.”
No, My signs had come to you but you denied them and you considered yourself great and you were among the infidels
And on the day of resurrection, you will see the faces of those who lied against Allah, (coloured) black. Is not the home of the proud in hell
And Allah will save those who guarded (against evil) because of their achievement, evil will not touch them nor will they grieve
Allah is the Creator of everything and He is a Trustee over everything
His are the keys of the skies and earth. And those who do not believe in the signs of Allah, those are the persons who are the losers
Say, “Then do you advise me to worship (something) other than Allah, O you ignorant people?”
And it has been communicated to you and those before you: If you associate partners (with Allah), your work will definitely become fruitless and you will definitely be among the losers
No, then serve Allah and be among those who are grateful
And they have not estimated Allah with the estimation due to Him. And the earth will be totally in His grip on the day of resurrection, with the skies rolled up in His right hand. Glorified is He and high (above) that which they associate as partners (with Him)
And it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe), so whoever is in the skies and whoever is in the earth will fall down senseless except he whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown into it a second time when they will stand seeing
And the earth will shine with the light of its Fosterer. And the record (of deeds) will be laid down and the prophets (informers) and the witnesses will be brought, and it will be judged between them with justice and they will not be dealt with unjustly
And every soul will be paid back in full for that which it did, and He knows best about that which they do
And those who did not believe will be driven to hell in troops until when they come to it, the doors of it will be opened and its guards will say to them, “Did messengers from among yourselves not come to you, reciting to you the signs of your Fosterer and warning you about the meeting of this day of yours?” They will say, “Why not, but the statement of punishment has become binding on the infidels.” unishment has become binding on the infidels.”
It will be said, “Enter the doors of hell to stay therein.” So evil is the home of the proud
And those who feared their Fosterer will be driven to the garden in troops until when they come to it, the doors of it will be opened and the guards of it will say to them, “Peace be on you, you are happy (lucky), so enter it to stay.”
And they will say, “Praise is due only for Allah Who has been true to us in His promise and He has made us to inherit the earth, we can settle down in the garden wherever we will.” So excellent is the reward of the workers
And you will see the angels inclining from (all) round (towards) the throne* glorifying by praising their Fosterer. And it will be judged between them with justice and it will be said, “Praise is due only for Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds.” * Probably the capital of the Universe
Haa Miim
The sending down of the book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Knowing
Protective Forgiver of sin and Accepter of repentance, Severe in requital, the Bountiful. There is no god except Him, towards Him is the destination
None dispute concerning the signs of Allah except those who do not believe, so do not let their going to and fro in the cities deceive you
The people of Nuh and the parties after them had denied earlier to these (people). And all communities had planned against their messenger to catch him and had disputed through falsehood so that they might make the truth to slip off through it, so I (too) caught them. Then how was My retribution
And thus the statement of your Fosterer became binding on those who did not believe that they will be the inhabitants of the fire
Those who bear ( the burden of ) the throne ( of the universe ) and those around it, glorify by praising their Fosterer and they believe in Him and seek protective forgiveness for those who believe: “Our Fosterer ! You embrace everything in mercy and knowledge, so protectively forgive those who repent and follow Your way and save them from the punishment of hell
Our Fosterer ! and make them enter the gardens of everlasting bliss which You have promised them, and whoever is righteous from among their fathers and their mates and their descendants, You are certainly the Mighty, the Wise
And save them from evil deeds, and whom You save from ( the consequences of ) evil deeds on that day, You have indeed shown mercy to him, and that is the great achievement.”
Those who did not believe will certainly be called out, “Allah’s hatred is greater than your hatred of yourselves ( now, because ) when you were invited towards belief you rejected.”
They ( will ) say, “Our Fosterer ! twice have You kept us dead and twice have You given us life, so we confess our sins. So is there any way to get out ( from the punishment)?”
That is because, when Allah alone was prayed to ( i.e. invoked ), you did not believe, and if partners were associated with Him you believed, so judgment belongs to Allah, the High, the Great
He it is Who shows you His signs and sends down provision for you from the sky, and no one is mindful except he who turns ( to Him)
So pray to Allah, making religion exclusively for Him even though the infidels dislike
Exalter of grades, Lord of the throne ( of the universe ). The spirit is sent down by His command on Whom He wills of His servants, that warning may be given by him concerning the day of meeting
The day when they will come forth, nothing concerning them will be hidden from Allah. To whom belongs the power this day? To Allah, the One, the Omnipotent
This day every soul will be rewarded according to what it earned, there will be no injustice this day. Allah is certainly Quick in ( settling ) the account
And warn them of the day that is drawing near, when the hearts will be choking near the throats, there will be no intimate friend for those who were unjust nor a mediator who could be obeyed
He ( Allah ) knows the misusers of the eyes and that which is hidden in the bosoms
And Allah judges with truth while those whom they pray to besides Him, cannot judge anything. Allah is certainly the Hearing, the Seeing
Did they not travel in the earth and see how the end of those before them was ( brought about )? They were severer than them in strength and ( in constructing ) memorials in the earth, but Allah caught them for their sins, and there was no one to guard them from Allah
That was because, their messengers had come to them with clear proofs but they rejected ( them) so Allah caught them, He is certainly Strong, Severe in requital
And We had sent Musa with Our signs and a clear authority
to Firawn and Haman and Qaroon, but they said, “( He is a ) magician, a liar.”
So when he came to them with the truth from Us, they said, “Kill the sons of those who believe with him and leave their women alive.” And the plot of the infidels ( ends ) in nothing but error
And Firawn said, “Leave me to kill Musa and let him call his Fosterer, I fear that he will change your religion or he will make corruption to appear in the earth.”
And Musa said, “I seek the protection of my Fosterer and your Fosterer from every proud person who does not believe in the day of account.”
And a believing man from among Firawn’s people who had kept his belief a secret, said, “Do you kill a man ( just ) because he says: My Fosterer is Allah and he has come to you with clear proofs from your Fosterer? And if he is a liar then on him will be ( the responsibility of ) his lie, but if he is truthful, then something of that which he is threatening you ( with ), will afflict you. Allah certainly does not guide him who is extravagant, a liar
O my people! Yours is the government this day and you are uppermost in the earth, but who will help us against the punishment of Allah if it comes to us?” Firawn said, “I do not show you anything except that which I see ( good for you ) and I do not lead you but to the right way.”
And he who had believed said, “O my people ! I fear for you ( something ) like the day of ( disaster which befell the ancient ) parties
like those of the people of Nuh and Aad and Samood and those after them. And Allah does not intent injustice for ( His ) servants
And O my people ! I fear for you the day of summoning
the day on which you will turn your backs retreating, there will be no protector for you from Allah and he whom Allah leaves to stray, then there is no guide for him
And Yusuf had come to you earlier with clear proofs, but you did not cease to be in doubt about that with which he came, until when he died you said: Allah will never raise a messenger after him. Thus does Allah leave to stray, him who is an extravagant doubter
Those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah, without ( any ) authority that He has given to them, it is greatly hateful in the sight of Allah and in the sight of those who believe. Thus does Allah set a seal on every proud, rebellious heart.”
And Firawn said, “O Haman ! build a lofty tower for me that I may reach the ways
the ways of the skies, then peep towards the God of Musa, and I definitely consider him to be a lair.” And thus the evil of his deeds was made fair seeming to Firawn and he was turned away from the way, and the plot of Firawn ( led to ) nothing but to ruin
And he who had believed said, “O my people ! follow me I will guide you to the right way
O my people ! this life of the world is only ( a temporary ) provision while the hereafter, that is certainly the home for staying
Whoever does evil, then he will not be rewarded except with the like of it, and whoever does righteous work from among men or women and he or she is a believer then those will enter the garden wherein they will be provided without measure
And O my people! how is it that I invite you towards safety while you invite me towards the fire
You invite me for not believing in Allah, and to associate with Him (things), about which I do not have knowledge, while I invite you towards the Mighty, the Protectively Forgiving
Assuredly, that towards which you invite me, is itself not fit to be prayed to in this world or in the hereafter, and our turning is towards Allah, and the extravagant, they will be the inhabitants of the fire
then you will remember what I had said to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah, Allah is certainly a Seer of (His) servants
So Allah saved him from the evil of that which they planned and an evil punishment engulfed Firawn’s people
The fire, they are presented before it morning and evening, and the day the hour of doom will be established ( it will be said ), “Make the people of Firawn enter the severest punishment.”
And when they will dispute with each other in the fire, the weak will say to those who considered themselves great, “We were your followers, so will you make us free form a portion of the fire?”
Those who considered themselves great will say, “We all are in it, Allah has certainly judged between ( His ) servants.”
And those in the fire will say, to the guards of hell, “Pray to your Fosterer to lighten for us (at least for) a day ( something ) of the punishment.”
They will say, “Did your messengers not come to you with clear proofs?” They will say, “Yes, why not?” The ( guards ) will say, “Then ( in that case ) you ( yourselves ) pray,” but the prayer of the infidels will be in vain
We certainly help Our messengers and those who believe, ( both ) in the life of this world and on the day when the witnesses will stand
the day on which their excuse will not benefit those who were unjust, and for them there will be a curse and for them there will be an evil home
And We gave Musa the guidance and We made the children of Israel inherit the book
(as ) guidance and a reminder for men of understanding
So be patient, the promise of Allah is certainly true and seek protection for your sin and glorify by praising your Fosterer in the evening and the morning
Those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah without ( any ) authority that has come to them, there is nothing in their bosoms ( hearts ) except ( the desire to be ) great, which they will certainly never attain, so seek the protection of Allah, He is certainly the Hearing, the Seeing
The creation of the skies and the earth is certainly greater than the creation of human beings, but the majority of human beings does not know
And the blind and the seeing are not equal, nor are those who believe and do righteous works ( equal to ) the evil doers, little is it that you mind
The hour of doom will certainly come, there is no doubt in it, but the majority of human beings does not believe
And your Fosterer has said, “Pray to me I will respond to you. Those who consider themselves great to serve ( worship ) Me, they will certainly enter hell, humbled.”
It is Allah Who has made the night for you, that you may rest therein, and the day visible. Allah is certainly Gracious to human beings, but the majority of human beings is not grateful
That is Allah your Fosterer, Creator of everything, there is no god except Him, then how are you turned away ( from the truth)
Thus were turned away those who used to knowingly reject the signs of Allah
It is Allah Who has made the earth a place of stay for you, and the sky a construction ( a structure above you ), and He gave you form, then made your forms excellent and provided you with good things. That is Allah your Fosterer, so blessed be Allah the Fosterer of the worlds
He is the Living, there is no god but He, so pray to Him, making religion exclusively for Him. Praise is due only for Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds
Say, “I am forbidden to worship those whom you pray to, besides Allah, when clear proofs have come to me from my Fosterer, and I am commanded to submit to the Fosterer of the worlds
He it is Who created you from the soil, then from the sperm, then from that which clings and hangs like a leech, then He brings you out as a child, then ( He keeps you alive ) so that you reach your ( age ) of strength, then ( He keeps you alive ) so that you become old, and among you is he who is taken back ( i.e. dies ) earlier, so that ( all of ) you reach the ( end of the ) appointed term, and that you may understand
He it is Who gives life and causes to die. So when He decides an affair, then He says to it only, “Be,” so it is
Did you not see towards those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah, how they are turned away
Those who deny the book and that with which We sent Our messengers, they will come to know
when they will be tied in their necks and chained to be dragged
into the boiling water, then in the fire they will be burned
Then it will be said to them, “Where are those whom you used to associate as partners ( with Allah)
(and to whom you prayed to ) besides Allah?” They will say, “They have gone away from us, no, we did not pray to anything earlier.” Thus Allah will leave the infidels to stray
That is because you used to exult in the earth without having the right to do so and because you used to be proud
Enter the doors of hell to stay therein, so evil is the home of the proud
So be patient, Allah’s promise is certainly true, so whether We show you something of that which We promise them or We take you back ( i.e. cause you to die ), ultimately towards Us will they ( all ) be returned
And We had sent messengers before you. Among them are those about whom We did narrate to you and among them are those about whom We did not narrate to you. And it is not for a messenger to come with a sign without Allah’s permission. So when the command of Allah came, it was judged with truth, and there lost those who were on falsehood
It is Allah Who has made the cattle for you that you may ride ( some ) of them and eat ( some ) of them
and ( there are other ) benefits for you in them, and that through them you may attain the need in your bosoms ( i.e. transport material ), and on them and on the ships you are carried
And He shows you His signs, so which of the signs of Allah will you reject
Then, did they not travel in the earth and see how the end of those before them was ( brought about )? They were more in number than them and severer in strength and ( in constructing ) memorials in the earth, but that which they used to earn was of no use to them
So when their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they were exultant because of that which was with them of knowledge, but that which they used to mock at, surrounded them
But when they saw Our punishment, they said, “We believe in Allah Who is One, and we reject that which we used to associate with Him as partners.”
But their belief was of no benefit to them after they had seen Our punishment. This was the procedure of Allah which has passed among His servants ( in earlier generations too ) and there the infidels lost
Haa Mim
Sent down from the Beneficent, the Merciful
(is ) a book, the signs of which are explained in detail, an Arabic Quran for a people who know
conveyer of good news and a warner, but most of them turn away so they do not hear
They say, “Our hearts are under protection from that which you invite us to, and in our ears is heaviness, and between us and you is a veil, so you ( do your ) work, we ( too ) are working.”
Say, “ I am only a man like you, it is communicated to me that your God is one God, so take the straight path towards Him and seek His protective forgiveness, and sorrowful is the state of the polytheists
who do not give the charity ( zakat ) and do not believe in the hereafter
Those who believe and do righteous works, for them is certainly a reward that will never fail.”
Say, “What! do you not believe in Him Who created the earth in two periods, and do you set up equals with Him? That is the Fosterer of the worlds.”
And He made in it mountains ( through the deposition of material ) from the surface of it, and blessed therein, and He destined in it its food in four periods , balanced ( according to the requirement ) of the seekers
Moreover, He set the balance towards the sky which was smoke. So he said to it and to the earth , “Come willingly or unwillingly.” They both said, “We come willingly,”
so He ordained them ( to get organized into ) seven skies ( higher levels ), in two periods, and communicated in each sky its affair. And We adorned the sky of the world with lamps* and protection. That is the programme of the Mighty, the Knowing. * Stars giving light due to conversion and burning of hydrogen to helium
So if they turn away then say, “I have warned you ( of a ) thunderbolt like the thunderbolt ( which had fallen on the people of ) Aad and Samood.”
When the messengers came to them from before them and from behind them ( saying ), “Do not serve ( worship, anything ) except Allah,” they said, “Had our Fosterer willed He would have sent down angels, so we are rejecters of that with which you are sent.”
So as for Aad, they considered themselves great in the earth without having the right to do so, and said, “Who is stronger than us in power?” Did they not consider that Allah Who created them is Stronger than them in power, and they used to knowingly reject Our signs
So We sent a furious wind on them during the days of loss, that We may make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world, and the punishment of the hereafter will be more disgraceful and they will not be helped
So as for Samood, We gave them guidance but they loved blindness compared to guidance, so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment took hold of them because of that which they used to earn
And We saved those who believed and guarded ( against evil)
And on the day the enemies of Allah will be gathered towards the fire, then they will be formed into ordered ranks
until when they come to it, their ears and their eyes and their skins will bear witness against them as to what they used to do
And they will say to their skins, “Why did you bear witness against us?” They will say, “Allah, Who gives speech to everything, has given us speech.” And He created you the first time and to Him you will be returned
And you did not hide yourselves lest your ears and your eyes and your skins should bear witness against you, but you guessed that Allah did not know many of ( the things ) which you did
And that guess of yours which you guessed about your Fosterer destroyed you, so you became of those at loss
So if they are patient ( even ) then the fire is the home for them, and if they seek goodwill, then they will not be of those who will be granted goodwill
And We have appointed comrades for them, so they make fair seeming to them that which is before them ( future ) and that which is behind them . And the word has proved true against them, ( as ) among the communities of the jinn and mankind that have passed away before them, ( that ) they will certainly be losers
And those who do not believe say, “Do not listen to this Quran and make noise when it is , perhaps you may be victorious.”
So We will definitely make those who do not believe, taste a severe punishment, and We will definitely reward them for the evil ( things ) which they used to do
That is the reward of the enemies of Allah, the fire, for them therein is an eternal home, a reward for that which they did with Our signs: ( They ) knowingly rejected ( them)
And those who had not believed will say, “Our Fosterer ! show us those who misled us from among the jinn and the human beings that we may place them beneath our feet, so that they may be of the lowest.”
Those who say, “Our Fosterer is Allah,” then are firmly established ( on it ), the angels certainly come down upon them ( saying ), “Do not fear nor grieve but receive the good news of the garden which you are promised
We are your protecting friends in the life of the world and in the hereafter, and for you therein, will be what your souls desire for and for you therein, will be what you pray for
an entertainment from the Protectively Forgiving, Merciful ( Allah ).”
And who is better in speech than he who invites towards Allah and does righteous work and says, “I am certainly of those who submit ( as Muslims ).”
And the good and the evil are not equal, repel ( evil ) with that which is better, then he between whom and you was enemity would become an intimate friend
And no one is made to receive this ( quality ) except the patient, and no one is made to receive it except the possessors of mighty good fortune
And if an instigation instigates you from the devil, then seek Allah’s protection, He is certainly the Hearing, the Knowing
And the night and the day and the sun and the moon are among His signs, ( so ) do not prostrate before the sun or the moon but prostrate before Allah Who created them, if it is Him alone you serve
So if they consider themselves great then those near your Fosterer glorify Him in the night and the day and they are not tired
And among His signs is that you see the earth barren but when We send down water on it, it stirs and swells. He Who gives life to it, is certainly the Giver of life to the dead, He certainly has power over everything
Those who move away from the right ( interpretation ) of Our signs are certainly not hidden from Us. Then is he who would be put in the fire better, or he who comes secure on the day of resurrection? Do what you will, He is certainly a Seer of what you do
(There are ) certainly those who do not believe in the reminder when it comes to them, though it is a might book
Falsehood cannot come to it from before it, or from behind it, ( it is ) sent down from the Wise, the Praised
Nothing is said to you except that which was said to the messengers before you. Your Fosterer is certainly the Possessor of protective forgiveness and Possessor of ( the power to ) painfully retribute
And had We made it a Quran in a foreign ( non Arabic ) language, they would have said, “Why have not its signs* been explained in detail ( in our Arabic language)? What ! a ( book in ) foreign ( language ) and ( the messenger and those addressed ) Arabs?” Say, “For those who believe, it is a guide and a healing, and ( for ) those who do not believe, there is a heaviness in their ears and it is obscure to them, ( it is as if ) they are called from a far off place. * Statements
And We had given the book to Musa but they disagreed therein. And had a word not gone forth from your Fosterer, it would have been judged between them, and they are certainly in a restless doubt about it
Whoever does righteous work, it is for ( the benefit of ) his own soul and whoever does evil then ( the harm of it is ) on him ( alone ) and your Fosterer is not unjust to His servants
To Him is referred the knowledge of the hour of doom. And no fruits come out of their coverings nor any female bears nor she lays down but it is with His knowledge. And on the day He calls them, “Where are My partners?” They will say, “We announce to you, none of us has any evidence ( of any such partners).”
And that which they used to pray to earlier, will go away from them, and they will realize ( that there is ) no escape for them
Man does not get tired of praying for good but when evil afflicts him, then he is hopelessly despairing
And if We make him taste mercy from Us after the harm that afflicted him, he definitely says, “This was ( due to ) me ( as my right ) and I do not think that the hour of doom will be established and ( even ) if I am brought back to my Fosterer, there will certainly be ( something ) good for me with Him.” So We will definitely inform those who did not believe, about that which they did and We will definitely make them taste ( something ) from a harsh punishment. hour of doom will be established and ( even ) if I am brought back to my Fosterer, there will certainly be ( something ) good for me with Him.” So We will definitely inform those who did not believe, about that which they did and We will definitely make them taste ( something ) from a harsh punishment
And when We show favour to man he keeps away and turns away to his side and when evil afflicts him then he is involved in lengthy prayers
Say, “You see, if the ( Quran ) is from Allah, then you do not believe in it, who is more astray then he who is deep in opposition?”
We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves . To the extent that it will become clear to them that it is the truth. Is it not sufficient concerning your Fosterer that He is a Witness over everything
Beware ! they are certainly in doubt about ( their) meeting with their Fosterer. Beware ! He certainly encompasses everything
Haa Miim
Ayn Siin Qaaf
Thus it is communicated to you and (it was similarly communicated) to those before you (that) Allah is the Mighty, the Wise
Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is His, and He is the High, the Great
The skies are about to cleave asunder from their top, while the angels glorify by praising their Fosterer and ask for protective forgiveness for those in the earth. Beware ! Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, the Merciful. iful
And those who take guardians besides Him, Allah is the Custodian over them and you are not a trustee over them
And thus We have communicated to you an Arabic Quran, that you may warn the original city ( Mecca ) and those around it, and warn them of the day of gathering wherein there is no doubt, a party will be in the garden and a party will be in the blazing fire
And had Allah willed, He would have made them a single community, but He admits whom He wills into His Mercy; and those who are unjust will have neither a guardian nor a helper
Or have they taken guardians besides Him? By Allah, He is the Guardian, and He gives life to the dead, and He has power over everything
And in whatever thing you disagree, the judgment thereof will be from Allah, that is Allah my Fosterer, in Him I put my trust and towards Him I turn
The Initiator of creation of the skies and the earth, He has made mates for you from among yourselves, and pairs of the cattle, whereby He multiplies you. There is nothing like His likeness and He is the Hearing, the Seeing
His are the keys of the skies and the earth, He enlarges the provision for whom He wills and straitens ( it for whomever and whenever He wills), He is certainly the Knower of everything
He has given to you the ( same ) law of religion which He had enjoined on Nuh; and that which We communicated to you and that which We enjoined on Ibrahim and Musa and Isa ( are also the same), that: “Establish the religion and do not be divided therein.” Hard on the polytheists is that which you invite them to. Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides towards Himself, him who turns ( to Him)
And they became divided only after the knowledge that came to them, (because of ) mutual envy. And had a statement from your Fosterer not gone forth (for giving them time) till an appointed term it would have been judged between them. And those who were made to inherit the book after them, are in a restless doubt concerning the ( Quran ). would have been judged between them. And those who were made to inherit the book after them, are in a restless doubt concerning the ( Quran)
Then invite to that, and be established ( on the Quran ) as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires, and say, “I believe in that which Allah has sent down of the book, and I am commanded to do justice between you, Allah is our Fosterer and your Fosterer, for us our deeds and for you your deeds, ( let there be ) no argument between us and you, Allah will bring us together and towards Him is the destination.”
And those who argue concerning Allah after He has been accepted, their argument is weightless with their Fosterer, and on them is anger and for them is severe punishment
It is Allah who has sent down the book containing the truth and the balance. And what will make you realize, perhaps the hour of doom is near
Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it, but those who believe are afraid of it and they know that it is true. Beware ! those who have a doubt concerning the hour of doom are certainly far astray ( from the truth)
Allah is gracious to His servants, He provides for whom He wills and He is the Strong, the Mighty
Whoever intends ( to have the ) tilth of the hereafter, We give increase to him in his tilth*, and whoever intends to have the tilth of this world, We give it to him from it but he has no portion in the hereafter. *Reward
Or have they partners who have made a law of religion for them, for which Allah has not given ( any ) permission? And had a decisive statement not been made, it would have been judged between them and for those who are unjust, there will certainly be a painful punishment
You will see those who were unjust, afraid of that which they earned, and that will befall them. And those who believed and did righteous works will be in meadows of gardens. They will have from their Fosterer what they will for. That is the great grace
That is ( the reward about ) which Allah conveys the good news to His servants who believe and do righteous works. Say, “I do not ask you for a reward for it, but love among relatives.” And whoever earns good We will give him more of good therein. Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, One Who acknowledges
Or do they say, “He has forged a lie against Allah.” ( If such a forgery is done ), then if Allah wills, He will put a seal on your heart; and Allah will abolish the falsehood and prove the truth by His words. He is certainly the Knower of the contents of the bosoms
And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons the evil deeds, and He knows what you do
And He responds to those who believe and do righteous works and He gives them more out of His grace; and the infidels, for them there is a severe punishment
And if Allah were to enlarge the provision of His servants they would rebel in the earth, but He sends down according to a programme that which He wills, He is certainly informed of, and seeing His servants
And He it is Who sends down the rain after they have despaired, and scatters His mercy, and He is the Guardian, the Praised
And among His signs is the creation of the skies and the earth and that which He has spread in them from among the living beings, and He has the power to gather them, when He wills
And whatever disaster befalls you it is due to what your own hands have earned and He pardons much
And you cannot frustrate ( Allah ) in the earth, and you do not have besides Allah any guardian or helper
And among His signs are the ships in the sea, like mountains
If He wills, He can make the wind stationary so that the ( ships ) remain motionless on its back*. Certainly there are signs in that for every patient grateful one. * Surface of the sea
Or He can cause them to perish due to that which they earned, but He pardons much
And ( let ) those who dispute concerning Our signs know ( that ) there is no escape for them
So anything that you are given, is only a ( temporary ) provision for the life of this world, and that which is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Fosterer
and those who avoid the great sins and indecencies and when they are angry they protectively forgive
and those who respond to their Fosterer and establish worship ( salat ) and their affairs ( are decided by ) counsel among themselves and they spend from that which We have provided them
and those who, when oppression afflicts them, they defend themselves
And the requital of an evil is an evil similar to it, but one who pardons and reconciles, then ( the responsibility of ) rewarding him is on Allah, He certainly does not like those who are unjust
And for him who defends after an injustice was done to him, then for such, there is no way ( of blame ) against them
The way ( of blame ) is only against those who do injustice to mankind and rebel in the earth without having the right to do so, for such, there will be a painful punishment
And whoever is patient and forgives, ( then ) those are certainly among the affairs ( which require ) determination
And he whom Allah leaves to stray, then for him there is no guardian after that. And you will see those who were unjust, that when they see the punishment they will say, “Is there any way to return?”
And you will see them being brought before the , humbled due to disgrace, looking secretly from the corners ( of their eyes ). And those who believe will say, “The losers are certainly those who are themselves at loss and their people ( too ), on the day of resurrection.” Beware ! those who are unjust will be in an eternal punishment
And they will have no guardians to help them besides Allah, and He whom Allah leaves to stray, for him there is no way ( of safety)
Respond to your Fosterer before the coming of the day from Allah, for which there is no turning back. On that day there will be no refuge for you nor will you have ( the power of ) rejection
But if they turn away, then We have not sent you as a custodian over them, there is nothing ( incumbent ) on you except conveyance ( of the message ). And when We make man taste mercy from Us, he is exultant thereat, but when an evil afflicts them due to what their hands have sent forth, then man certainly becomes ungrateful ( forgetting the earlier good days)
Allah’s is the kingdom of the skies and the earth. He creates what He wills, He grants females ( daughters ) to whom He wills and He grants males ( sons ) to whom He wills
Or He pairs them ( by granting both ) males and females and He makes barren whom He wills. He is certainly Knowing, Powerful
And it is not for a man that Allah should speak to him except ( through inspirational ) communication or from behind a veil or by sending a messenger who communicates by His permission what He wills, He is certainly High, Wise
And thus ( in the manner listed last above ), We have communicated to you ( through ) the spirit ( angel Jibreel, the message ), by Our command. You did not know what the book was nor ( did you know what ) the belief ( was ), but We made it a light, guiding thereby, whom We will of Our servants, and you are certainly guiding towards the straight path, the book was nor ( did you know what ) the belief ( was ), but We made it a light, guiding thereby, whom We will of Our servants, and you are certainly guiding towards the straight path
the path of Allah, Whose is whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth. Beware ! towards Allah is the destination of affairs
Haa Mim
By the book that makes ( things ) clear
We have made it an Arabic Quran that you may understand
And it is in the original book with Us, high, full of wisdom
What ! shall We then keep away the reminder from you, ignoring ( you, just ) because you are an extravagant people
And how many a prophet did We send among the ancients
And there did not come to them ( any ) prophet but they mocked at him
So We destroyed those who were stronger than these in taking hold, and the example of the ancients has gone ( before them)
And if you ask them, “Who created the skies and the earth?” They will definitely say, “The Mighty, the Knowing has created them.”
He Who made the earth ( suitable for ) habitation for you, and He made for you roads therein, that you may find the right way
And He Who sent down water from the sky according to a programme, then We raise ( to life ) therewith a dead land, thus, you ( too ) will be brought out
And He Who created pairs of all ( things ) and made for you the ships, and from among the cattle , those on which you ride
that you may balance yourselves on their backs, then remember the favour of your Fosterer on you when you balance yourselves on them and say, “Glorified be He Who has subjected these to us ( for our use ) and we were not able to do it
and we will certainly return to our Fosterer.”
And they assign to Him from His servants, a part ( as sons, daughters, partners, etc), man to be certain is clearly ungrateful
What ! has He taken daughters from what He has created and chosen sons for you
And when one of them is given the news of ( the birth of a daughter, something ) similar to that which he assigns to the Beneficent ( Allah ), his face is shadowed black and he is full of grief
What ! ( do they assign to Allah daughters ) who are brought up in ornaments and who are without clarity during a dispute
And they regard the angels, who are servants of the Beneficent ( Allah ), ( as ) females. Did they witness their creation? Their evidence will be recorded and they will be questioned
And they say, “If the Beneficent ( Allah ) had willed, we would not have worshipped them.” They do not have any knowledge about that, they do nothing but guess
Or did We give them a book before this so that they are holding fast to it
No, they say, “We found our fathers on ( these ) religious procedures and we are guided by their footsteps.”
And thus We had not sent any warner before you to any town but those well-off therein, said, “We found our fathers on ( these ) religious procedures and we are followers of their footsteps.”
(The warner had ) said, “Even if I bring to you guidance which is better than that on which you found your fathers?” They said, “We are certainly rejecters of that with which you are sent.”
So We inflicted retribution on them, then see how the end of the deniers was ( brought about)
And when Ibrahim said to his father and his people, “I am free from that which you serve ( worship)
except Him Who initiated my creation, so He will certainly guide me,”
and he made this a statement that remained among those who followed him, that they may return ( to the right path)
No, I made these and their fathers enjoy, till there came to them the truth and a messenger ( making things ) clear
And when the truth came to them they said, “This is magic and we do not believe in it.”
And they said, “Why was this Quran not sent down on ( some ) great man from ( either of ) the two cities ( of Mecca or Taif )?”
Do they distribute the mercy of your Fosterer? We distribute among them their livelihood in the life of this world; and We have elevated some of them over others in grades that some of them may take others in subjection ( and extract work ), and the mercy of your Fosterer is better than that which they amass
And were it not that ( the whole of ) mankind would have become one community, We would have made for those who do not believe in the Beneficent ( Allah ), their houses with roofs of silver and the stairs ( too, climbing ) on which they go up
and the doors of their houses and the couches on which they recline ( all of silver)
and ( given them other items of ) decoration. But all that is nothing but an enjoyment of the life of this world, while the hereafter with your Fosterer, is for those who guard ( against evil)
And he who turns away from the remembrance of the Beneficent ( Allah ), We appoint a devil for him, so that he becomes his comrade
and the ( devils ) turn them way from the away, but they think that they are rightly guided
until when he comes to Us, he says, “I wish that between me and you there were the distance of the two east’s,” so the comrade is an evil ( one)
And ( your regrets ) will not be of (any ) profit to you this day when you were unjust ( earlier ), ( and the decision will be ) that you will be sharers in the punishment
Can you then make the deaf to hear, or guide the blind and he who is in clear error
So if We take you away, then We will certainly inflict retribution on them
Or We may show you that which We have promised them, as We are the Holders of power over them
So hold fast to that which is communicated to you, you are certainly on the straight path
And this is certainly a reminder for you and your people and you all will be questioned
And ask those of the messengers whom We sent before you, “Did We appoint besides the Beneficent (Allah, any other) gods to be served ( worshipped ) by them?”
And We had sent Musa with Our signs to Firawn and his chiefs, so he said, “I am a messenger of the Fosterer of the worlds.”
But when he brought to them Our signs, then they laughed at them
And We did not show them any sign, but it was greater than its sister , and We afflicted them with the punishment that they might return ( towards Us)
And they said, “O you magician ! pray to your Fosterer according to His agreement which He has made with you (to remove the punishment from Us), we will certainly be of those who are guided.”
But when We removed the punishment from them, then they went against their word
And Firawn announced among his people saying, “O my people! is not the kingdom of Egypt mine? And these rivers flowing beneath me? Do you not then see
And am I not better than this (person) who is disgraceful and can hardly express himself clearly
Why then, bracelets of gold have not been put on him or angels come down along with him as companions?”
Thus he sought to make light to his people (Musa’s esteem), so they followed him, they were certainly a transgressing people
So when they angered Us We inflicted retribution on them and drowned them all together
And We made them a precedent and an example for others
And When the son of Maryam is cited as an example, then your people raise a hue and cry thereat
and say, “Are our gods better or he?” They do not strike you (with) this statement but for disputation. No, they are a disputing people
He was nothing but a servant on whom We had bestowed favour and We had made him an example for the children of Israel
And if We will, We could make angels from you, succeeding (you) in the earth
And he (Isa) is certainly the knowledge (a sign) for the hour of doom, so do not doubt about it and follow me, this is the straight path
And do not let the devil turn you away (from the straight path), he is certainly an open enemy to you
And when Isa came with clear proofs, he said, “I have indeed come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some (of the things) about which you disagree, so fear Allah and obey me
Allah is my Fosterer and your Fosterer, so serve (worship) Him, this is certainly the straight path.”
But parties from among them disagreed, so, sorrowful will be the state of those who were unjust because of the punishment of the painful day
Do they wait for anything except the hour of doom, that it should come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive
Friends on that day will be enemies of one another except those who had guarded (against evil)
O My servants! there is no fear on you this day nor shall you grieve
those who believed in Our signs and had submitted (as Muslims)
enter the garden, you and your mates, you will be made happy
Bowls of gold and cups will be sent round for them, and therein there will be what their souls desire for and delight for the eyes and you will stay therein
And that is the garden which you will be made to inherit because of that which you used to do
For you therein are many fruits from which you will eat
The criminals will certainly remain in the punishment of hell
It will not be lightened for them and they will be in despair therein
And We were not unjust to them but they were themselves unjust
And they will call out, “O Malik (Angel incharge of hell)! let your Fosterer make an end of us.” He will say, “You certainly have to stay (here)
we had come to you with the truth but most of you were of those who had a dislike for the truth.”
Or have they settled an affair? But We are the settlers (of affairs)
Or do they think that We do not hear their secret talks and conferences? Why not, and Our messengers with them, they record
Say, “If the Beneficent (Allah) had a son, then I would have been the first of the servants.”
Glorified be the Fosterer of the skies and the earth, Lord of the throne (of the universe), He is above what they describe
So leave them involved in idle talk and play until they meet their day which they are promised
And He it is Who is the God in the sky and the God in the earth and He is the Wise, the Knowing
And blessed is He Whose is the kingdom of the skies and the earth and that which is between them. And with Him is the knowledge of the hour of doom and towards Him you will be returned
And those whom they pray to, besides Him, do not have the power of recommendation, except they who bear witness with truth while they know
And if you ask them who created them, they will definitely say, “Allah.” Then how are they turned away (from the truth)
And he (prophet) says, “O my Fosterer ! these are the people who certainly do not believe.”
So turn away from them and say, “Peace,” but they will know
Haa Miim
By the book that makes (things) clear
We certainly sent it down during a blessed night, We are certainly the Warners
Every wise affair is made distinct in it (by)
a command from Us, We are certainly the Senders
a mercy from your Fosterer, He is certainly the Hearing, the Knowing
the Fosterer of the skies and the earth and that which is between them, if you like to be of those who are certain
There is no god except Him, He gives life and causes death, your Fosterer and the Fosterer of your forefathers
No, they are in doubt (therefore) they are not serious
So be vigilant for the day when clear smoke will come from the sky
which will cover mankind, this will be a painful punishment
(People will pray), “Our Fosterer! remove from us the punishment we will certainly believe.”
How can their being mindful (be beneficial on that day), when a messenger who was clear (in his message) had come to them (earlier, but)
then they had turned away from him while saying, “One taught (by others), one under the influence of jinn.”
We will remove the punishment a little (but) you will certainly return (to evil)
One day We will seize with a great seizure. We are certainly Inflicters of retribution
And before them We had tested the people of Firawn, when an honourable messenger came to them, (saying)
that, “Deliver to me the servants of Allah (children of Israel), I am a trustworthy messenger to you,”
and that, “Do not transgress against Allah, I have come to you with a clear authority
And I seek the protection of my Fosterer and your Fosterer, lest you stone me
And if you do not believe me then withdraw from me.”
Then he prayed to his Fosterer that, “These are a people who are criminals
(Musa was ordered by Allah), “Then travel (away at) night with My servants, you will certainly be pursued (by Firawn’s army)
and let the sea remain (as a dry path in the form of) a furrow (bounded by water on two sides), they are an army to be drowned.”
How many of the gardens and springs have they left (behind)
and corn fields and places of honour
and comforts in which they used to be joyful
Thus (it happened), and We made other people to inherit (all those things)
So neither the sky nor the earth wept over them, nor were they given time (for amendment)
And We saved the children of Israel from the disgraceful punishment
of Firawn, he was certainly a transgressor, one among the extravagant
And We chose them on (the issue of) knowledge, above the worlds (all people)
and We brought to them such of the signs in which there was clear trial
These certainly say
“There is nothing but our first death and we will not be raised again
then bring back our fathers if you are truthful.”
Are they better or the people of Tubba and those before them? We destroyed them, they were certainly criminals
And We did not create the skies and the earth and that which is between them, in play
We did not create them but in reality, but the majority of them does not know
The day of decision is certainly their appointed term, of all of them
A day on which a friend will not be of any use to (another) friend in anything, nor will they be helped
except him on whom Allah has mercy. He is certainly the Mighty, the Merciful
Certainly the tree of Zaqqum
is food of the sinner
like molten brass, it will boil in the stomachs
like the boiling of hot water
(It will be said), “Catch him then drag him to the middle of the hell
then pour above his head, from the tormenting boiling water
Taste ! you were the mighty, the honoured
This is certainly that about which you used to doubt.”
Those who guarded (against evil) will certainly be in a secure place
in gardens and springs
dressed in fine and thick silk, facing each other
Thus (it will happen).And We will pair them with fair ones (having) wide beautiful eyes
Therein, they will call for every fruit, being secure
They will not taste death therein, except the first death, and He will save them from the punishment of hell
A grace from your Fosterer, that is the great achievement
So We have made the (Quran) easy in your language only that they may be mindful
So be vigilant, they (too) are certainly vigilant
Haa Miim
The sending down of the book is from Allah, the Mighty, the Wise
In the skies and the earth there are certainly signs for the believers
and in your own creation (too), and (in) that which He has spread from among the living beings there are signs for a people who are certain
and (in) the alternation of the night and the day and (in) the provision which Allah sends down from the sky then gives life through it to the earth after its death, and (in) the changing of winds, there are signs for a people who understand
These are the communications of Allah which We recite to you with truth, then in which statement after (that of) Allah and His signs, will they believe
Sorrowful is the state of every sinful liar
who hears the signs of Allah when they are recited to him, then persists proudly as if he did not hear them, so convey to him the news of a painful punishment
And when he comes to know of any of Our signs, he takes it as mockery, for them there will be a disgraceful punishment
Beyond them is hell, and nothing of that which they earned will be of any use to them, nor that which they had taken as guardians besides Allah (will be of any use), and for them there is a great punishment
This is the guidance. And those who do not believe in the signs of their Fosterer, for them there is a painful punishment of weakening uneasiness
It is Allah Who subjected to your service the sea, that the ships may sail in it by His command and that you may seek of His grace and that you may be grateful
and subjected to your service that which is in the skies and that which is in the earth, all from Him . Certainly there are signs in that for a people who reflect
Say to those who believe (that) they should forgive those who do not expect the days of Allah, that He may reward people according to that which they used to earn
One who does righteous work, then it is for (the benefit of) his own soul and one who does evil then (the harm of it) is on him alone, then towards your Fosterer will you be returned
And We gave the book to the children of Israel and (also) wisdom and prophet hood, and We provided them with the good things and We made them excel (others in) the worlds
and We gave them clear explanations of the (religious) affair, and they did not disagree except after the knowledge which had come to them, (because of) envy among themselves. Your Fosterer will certainly judge between them on the day of resurrection, concerning that about which they used to disagree
Then We made you to follow a procedure in the (religious) affair, so follow it and do not follow the desires of those who have no knowledge
they will certainly not make you independent of any from Allah. And those who are unjust are friends of each other, while Allah is the Guardian of those who guard (against evil)
These are (items of) insight for mankind and mercy guidance and for a people who are certain
Or do those who keep themselves busy in evil works, think that We will make them like those who believe and do righteous works, (so that) their life and their death (become) equal? That which they judge is evil
And Allah created the skies and the earth in reality, so that every soul may be rewarded for that which it earned and (that) they may not be dealt with unjustly
Then have you seen him who takes his desire for his god while Allah has left him to stray on (the basis of his) knowledge, and has set a seal on his hearing and his heart and has placed a covering on his sight? So who can guide him after Allah? Will you not then be mindful
And they say, “There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us but time,” and they have no knowledge of that, they do nothing but guess
And when Our clear signs are recited to them, their argument is nothing but that they say, “Bring (back) our fathers, if you are the truthful ones.” are the truthful ones.”
Say, “Allah gives you life then He causes you to die, then He will gather you towards the day of resurrection, about which there is no doubt, but the majority of human beings does not know.”
And Allah’s is the kingdom of the skies and the earth. And the day the hour of doom will be established, on that day, those who followed falsehood will be at a loss
And you will see every community kneeling, every community will be called towards its record, this day you are rewarded for that which you used to do
This is Our record which speaks about you with truth. We certainly got recorded that which you used to do
Then as for those who believed and did righteous works, their Fosterer will make them enter into His mercy, that is a dear achievement
And as for those who did not believe, (it will be said), “Then were not Our signs recited to you? But you considered yourselves great and you were a criminal people.”
And when it was said, “The promise of Allah is certainly true and the hour of doom, there is no doubt about it, ”you said, “We do not know what the hour of doom is, we think that it is nothing but a guess and we are not of those who are certain (about it).”
And the evil which they did will be made manifest to them and that which they used to mock at, will engulf them
And it will be said, “This day We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this day of yours, and your settling place is the fire, and there are no helpers for you
That is because you took the signs of Allah for mockery and the life of the world deceived you, so this day they will not be brought out from it, nor will they be able to seek goodwill.”
So praise is due only for Allah, Fosterer of the skies and Fosterer of the earth, Fosterer of the worlds
And to Him belongs greatness in the skies and the earth and He is the Mighty, the Wise
HaaMiim
The sending down of the book is from Allah the Mighty, the Wise
We did not create the skies and the earth and that which is between them but in reality and for an appointed term, while those who do not believe turn away from that which they are warned
Say, “Have you considered that which you pray to, besides Allah, show me what they have created from the earth? Or is there a partnership for them in the skies? Bring me a book (which existed) before this or a proof (based) on knowledge, if you are truthful.”
And who is more astray than one who prays to those besides Allah, who would not respond to him till the day of resurrection and who are unaware of their praying (to them)
And when human beings are gathered, they will be their enemies and they will reject (that) the (human beings) worshipped (them)
And when Our clear signs are recited to them, those who do not believe say concerning the truth when it comes to them, “This is clear magic.”
Do they say, “He has forged it?” Say, “If I have forged it (even) then you do not control for me anything from Allah, He knows best concerning that which you utter about it, He is sufficient as a Witness between me and. you, and He is the Protectively Forgiving, the Merciful.”
Say, “I am not the first of the messengers and I do not know what will be done with me or with you. I do not follow anything except that which is communicated to me and I am nothing but a clear warner.”
Say, “Do you see, if this is from Allah and you do not believe in it, while a witness from among the children of Israel has (already) borne witness over (something) similar to it and believed (in it earlier), and you consider yourselves great (then who is at loss)? Allah certainly does not guide the unjust people.”
And those who do not believe say regarding those who believe, “If the (Quran) were good they would not have preceded us in (accepting) it.” And when they do not receive guidance through it, then they say, “This is an old lie.”
And before it there was the book of Musa, a guide and a mercy; and this is a book confirming (it) in Arabic language that it may warn those who are unjust and (give) good news to the doers of good
Those who say, “Our Fosterer is Allah,” then they are established (on it), then certainly, there will neither be any fear on them nor will they grieve
Those are the inhabitants of the garden, they will stay in it, a reward for that which they used to do
And We have enjoined on man, doing of good to his parents, his mother bears him with hardship and delivers him with hardship, and the bearing of him and the weaning of him takes thirty months, until when he reaches his strength (maturity) and reaches forty years, he says, “O my Fosterer! arouse me that I may be grateful for Your favour which You have bestowed on me and my parents and that I may do righteous work which pleases You, and set right for me (the affair) in (connection with) my descendants, I certainly turn to You and I am certainly of those who submit (as Muslims).”
Those are the persons from whom We accept the good deeds which they do, and We overlook their evil deeds. (They are) among the inhabitants of the garden, a true promise which they are promised
And he who says to his parents, “Fie* on you both, do you threaten me that I will be brought out when generations have passed away before me?” And they both seek Allah’s help, “Sorrowful is your state, believe, Allah’s promise is certainly true," then he says, "These are nothing but the stories of the ancient.” *An expression of disgust generations have passed away before me?” And they both seek Allah’s help, “Sorrowful is your state, believe, Allah’s promise is certainly true," then he says, "These are nothing but the stories of the ancient.” *An expression of disgust
Those are from among the communities of the jinn and mankind which have passed away before them, on whom the word has proved true, they will certainly be of the losers
And for all there will be grades according to that which they did, that He may pay back to them in full, (the reward of) their deeds, and they will not be dealt with unjustly
And on that day those who did not believe will be presented before the fire (and it will be said), “You took away (your share of) good things in your life of the world and you enjoyed in it, so this day you will be rewarded with the punishment of humility because you used to consider yourselves great in the earth without having the right to do so and because you used to transgress.”
And mention (to them about) the brother of Aad (Hud), when he warned his people at Al Ahqaf (the sand hills).And indeed warners came before him and after him, (each one saying) that, “Do not serve (worship) anyone except Allah, I fear for you the punishment of the great day.”
They said, “Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods? Then bring to us that with which you threaten us, if you are of the truthful ones.”
He said, “The knowledge (thereof) is only with Allah and I convey to you only that which his communicated to me, but I see (that) you are an ignorant people.”
Then when they saw the (punishment in the form of) a cloud coming towards their valleys, they said, “This is a cloud which will give us rain.” No, it is that which you sought to be hastened on, wind in which is a painful punishment
(it will) destroy everything by the command of its Fosterer. So they became such that nothing could be seen except their houses. Thus do We reward the criminal people
And We had indeed established them in (a condition) in which We have not established you. And We made for them (the means of) hearing and seeing and the hearts, but their hearing and their seeing and their hearts were of no use to them in anything when they knowingly rejected Allah’s signs, and that which they used to mock at engulfed them
And indeed We destroyed the towns which are around you, and repeated Our signs that they may turn (to Us)
Then why did those whom they had taken as gods besides Allah (for achieving) nearness (to Him), not help them? No, they disappeared from them, and that was their falsehood and that which they used to forge
And when We turned towards you a party of the jinn seeking to hear the Quran, so when they were present before it they said, “Be silent and listen.” Then when the (recital) had finished they turned towards their people (others like them) warning (them)
They said, “O our people! we have heard a book sent down after Musa, confirming that which is before it, it guides towards the truth and towards a straight path
O our people! respond to one who invites towards Allah and believe in Him, He will forgive you your sins and protect you from the painful punishment
And he who does not respond to one who invites towards Allah, then he cannot defeat (Allah) in the earth and there will be no guardians for him besides Him. Those are in clear error,”
Did they not consider that Allah Who created the skies and the earth, and was not tired in creating them, is able to give life to the dead? Why not ! He certainly has power over everything
And the day those who do not believe will be presented before the fire (and asked). “Is not (all this happening) in reality?” They will say, “Why not by our Fosterer (it is real).”He will say, “Then taste the punishment because you used to reject (it)
So be patient, as those among the messengers possessing determination were patient, and do not seek to hasten for them (the punishment). The day they will see that which they are promised, it will be as if they did not stay but for an hour of a day. (Your responsibility is) conveyance of the message. Then who (else) will be destroyed except the transgressing people
Those who do not believe and turn away (people) from the way of Allah, He makes their deeds get lost
And those who believe and do righteous works and believe in that which is sent down on Muhammed, and that is the truth from their Fosterer, He removes from them their evils and sets right their condition
That is because those who do not believe follow falsehood and those who believe follow the truth from their Fosterer. Thus Allah sets forth for mankind their similitudes
So when you meet (in the battle) those who do not believe, strike off their necks until when you dominate them, then strengthen the bounds (of imprisonment); then afterwards, either show favour or ransom (them), till the war (ends and) lays down its burdens (do like) that. And if Allah wills, He can defend (you) from them, but (He involves you in such situations) that He may test some of you by means of others. And those who are killed in the way of Allah, their deeds will never be lost
He will guide them and set right their condition
And He will make them enter the garden which He has made known to them
O you who believe! if you help Allah, He will help you and make your feet firm
And those who do not believe, there is destruction for them and He makes their deeds get lost
That is because they disliked that which Allah sent down, so He made their deeds become fruitless
Have they not then traveled in the earth and seen, how the end of those before them was (brought about)? Allah brought down destruction upon them and for (these) infidels (too, there will be something) similar to it
That is because Allah is the Guardian of those who believe, and because the infidels have no guardian for them
Allah will certainly make those who believe and do righteous works enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, and those who do not believe, (they) enjoy themselves and eat as the cattle eat, and the fire will be their home
And how many towns (were there) which were severer in strength than your town (Mecca) which sent you out, (but) We destroyed them, so there was no helper for them
Then, is he, who is on a clear proof from his Fosterer, like him, to whom the evil of his deed is made fair-seeming? And they follow their desires
A similitude of the garden, which is promised to those who guard (against evil): In it there are rivers of water without pollution and rivers of milk the taste of which does not change and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers and rivers of clarified honey and therein for them are all (kinds) of fruits and protective forgiveness from their Fosterer. (Are these) like those who will stay in the fire and will be given boiling water to drink so that it cuts their bowels
And among them are those who seek to hear you until when they go out from your presence, (then) they say to those who have been given knowledge, “What was it that he said just now?” Those are the persons on whose hearts Allah has set a seal and they follow their desires
And those who receive guidance, He increases them in guidance and gives them (the quality of) guarding (against evil)
Do they wait for anything but the hour of doom that it should come on them suddenly? Then its tokens have already come. Then how will their (being) mindful (be beneficial) to them when it (actually) comes on them
Then know that there is no god except Allah and seek protection for your sin and for the believing men and the believing women. And Allah knows your places of movement and your places of rest (homes)
And those who believe say, “Why is not a sura, (a chapter of the Quran) sent down?” But when a decisive sura is sent down and fighting is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is a disease, looking at you with a look of one who is fainting because of death, so sorrowful is their state
(What is required is) obedience and a recognised (good) word. Then when the affair is determined, then if they be truthful to Allah, that would be better for them
But if you held command, is it not possible that you will cause corruption in the earth and cut off the ties of your relationships
Those are the persons whom Allah has cursed so He has made them deaf and blinded their eyes
Do they not then reflect on the Quran or are there locks on their hearts
Those who turn on their backs after (receiving) the guidance which has been made clear to them, the devil has certainly inclined them (away from the Quran) while giving them (false) hopes
That is because, they say to those who dislike that which Allah has sent down, “We will obey you in some of the affairs,” and Allah knows their secrets
Then how will it be when the angels will take them back (by causing them to die), striking their faces and their backs
That is because, they followed that which displeased Allah and disliked pleasing Him, therefore He made their deeds fruitless
Or do those in whose hearts is a disease think, that Allah will not expose their bad intentions
And if We will We could show them to you, so that you could recognise them by their marks, and you will definitely recognise them by (their) distortion in speech and Allah knows your deeds
And We will definitely test you till We know (mark out) those among you who strive and are patient, and We will , examine the reports of your (behaviour)
Those who do not believe and turn away (people) from the way of Allah and oppose the messenger after (receiving) the guidance which has been made clear to them, they will certainly never be able to harm Allah in anyway and He will make their deeds fruitless
O you who believe! obey Allah and obey the messenger and do not make your deeds vain
Those who do not believe and turn away (people) from the way of Allah then die while they are infidels, then Allah will never forgive them
So do not be weak (hearted) and (do not) invite (them) towards peace when you are dominating, and Allah is with you and He will never leave your deeds (go unrewarded)
The life of this world is only sport and pastime and if you believe and guard (against evil), He will give you your reward and He will not ask you for your wealth
If He asks you for the (wealth) then insists (on it) you will hoard it (due to niggardliness) and your bad intentions will be exposed
Behold ! you are such people who are invited to spend in the way of Allah, but among you is he who hoards (due to niggardliness). But he who hoards, is niggardly only against his own soul. And Allah is Independent while you are the needy, and if you turn away He will exchange you for people other than you, then they will not be like you
We certainly opened for you (a way by giving you) a clear victory
that Allah may protect you from (every) sin of yours which you (could) send in advance and which you (could) leave behind and complete His favour on you and guide you on the right path
and (that) Allah may help you with a mighty help
He it is Who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers that they may (thereby receive more) belief added to their belief, and Allah’s are the forces of the skies and the earth and Allah is Knowing, Wise

and (that) He may punish the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women and the polytheist men and the polytheist women who entertain an evil thought about Allah. On them is an evil turn of fortune and the anger of Allah is on them and He has cursed them and prepared for them hell and it is an evil destination
And Allah’s are the forces of the skies and the earth and Allah is Mighty, Wise
We have sent you as a witness and a conveyer of good news and a warner
so that you all should believe in Allah and His messenger and honour Him and rever Him and glorify Him morning and evening
Those who swear allegiance to you certainly swear allegiance only to Allah, the hand of Allah is above their hands. So whoever breaks (the agreement, the loss of) his breaking (it) is only on his own soul and whoever fulfils the agreement which he has made with Allah, then He will give him a great reward. reward
Those of the desert Arabs who were left behind will say to you, “Our wealth and our people kept us occupied, so seek protective forgiveness for us.” They say with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say, “Then who can control anything for you against Allah, if He intends to harm you or intends to benefit you? No, Allah is informed of that which you do.”
No, you expected that the messenger of Allah and the believers will never return to their people, and that was made fair seeming to your hearts, and you expected an evil expectation and you are a people who are lost
And whoever does not believe in Allah and His messenger, We have certainly prepared a blazing fire for (such) infidels
And Allah’s is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, He protectively forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
When you proceed to take the booty (of war), those who were left behind will say, “Allow us to follow you.” They intend to change the word of Allah, say, “You will never follow us, thus has Allah said before.” Then they will say, “No, you are jealous of us.” No, they do not understand except a little
Say to those of the desert Arabs who were left behind, “You will be called for (fighting against) a people who possess mighty strength, you will fight them until they surrender. So if you obey, Allah will give you a good reward but if you turn back as you turned back earlier, He will punish you with a painful punishment
There is no blame on the blind, nor is there any blame on the lame, nor is there any blame on the sick (if they do not go out for participation in religious wars); and whoever obeys Allah and His messenger, He will make him enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, but whoever turns back He will punish him with a painful punishment. punish him with a painful punishment
Allah was indeed pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree, and He knew that which was in their hearts so He sent down tranquility on them and rewarded them with a near victory
and much booty which they take, and Allah is Mighty, Wise
Allah promised you much booty which you will take, then He hastened this for you and held back the hands of men from you so that it may be a sign for the believers and (that) He may guide you on the straight path
and other (gains) on which you do not have power (right now), Allah has indeed encompassed them (for you) and Allah has power over everything
And if those who do not believe fight with you, they would certainly turn (their) backs, then they would not find any guardian or a helper
(This has been the) procedure of Allah which has passed earlier and you will never find a change in the procedure of Allah
And it was He Who had held back their hands from you and your hands from them in the interior of Mecca, after He had given you victory over them , and Allah is the Seer of what you do
Those were the persons who did not believe and turned you away from the Sacred Mosque and stopped the offering from reaching its destination. And had believing men and believing women not been there, whom you did not know and whom you would have trampled, then distress would have befallen you on account of them, unknowingly. (You were held back) so that Allah may make to enter into His mercy, whom He wills. Had they (the believers and infidels) been separated (one from another). We would have punished those who did not believe from among them, with a painful punishment
When those who did not believe, cherished in their hearts a rage and (that too) the rage of ignorance, then Allah sent down His tranquility on His messenger and on the believers, and made them stick to the statement of restrain, and they deserved it and were worthy of it, and Allah has knowledge of everything
Allah indeed made true, His messenger’s vision of reality, that if Allah wills, you will definitely enter the Sacred Mosque secure, (some) having your heads shaved while (others having their hair) reduced, (entering) without fear. So He knew that which you did not know, therefore He brought about a near victory (of Khaiber), besides that
He it is Who has sent His messenger with guidance and the religion of truth that He may make it prevail over every religion, and Allah is sufficient as a Witness
Muhammed is the messenger of Allah, and those with him are strong against the infidels and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing down, prostrating, seeking grace from Allah and (His) pleasure, their marks due to the effect of, prostrations are there in their faces.

(They are) like vegetation which (first) puts forth its sprout then it becomes firm then it becomes thick, then it stands balanced on its stem, pleasing the sowers, that He may make the infidels angry through them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous works, protective forgiveness and a great reward

O you who believe ! do not let (some) people consider (other) people lower than (themselves), it may be that (the other people) are better than them, nor let (some) women, (consider other )women (lower than themselves), it may be that (the other women) are better than them. And do not find fault (among) yourselves, nor call (one another) by nicknames, (even taking) the name of transgression is an evil after (having) believed, and those who do not repent, then those are the persons who are unjust
O you who believe! avoid much of suspicion, (because) suspicion in some (cases) is certainly a sin, and do not spy (being inquisitive about the secrets of others) and do not backbite one another, would anyone of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother?

And We send down blessed water from the sky, then We cause to grow through it gardens and grain that is reaped
and tall date palms, the produce of which is layered
a provision for (Our) servants, and We give life through it to a dead land, thus will be the coming out (on the day of resurrection)

So by the Fosterer of the sky and the earth, it is certainly a truth similar (to the truth) that you speak
Has the story of the honoured guests of Ibrahim come to you
When they entered upon him then said, “Peace.” He said, “Peace, people not recognisable.”
Then he went towards his people and brought a (roasted) fat calf
and set it near them (and) said, “Will you not eat?”
So he conceived a fear due to them. They said, “Do not fear,” and they gave him the good news of (the birth of) a boy possessing knowledge
At (this news) his wife came forward in (a state of wonder), shouting and striking her face, and said, “(How can I have a child when I am) a barren old woman?”
They said, “Thus (it will be), says your Fosterer. He is certainly the Wise, the Knowing.”
He said, “Then what is your affair (for which you have been sent) O you messengers?”
They said, “We are sent to a criminal people
that we may send upon them (porous) stones of clay
marked from your Fosterer for (the punishment of) the extravagant.”
Then We brought out those who believed from among them
but We did not find therein any Muslims except (in) one house
And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment
And in Musa (there is a sign) when We sent him to Firawn with clear authority
But he turned away with his force and said, “A magician or one influenced by the jinn.”
So We caught him and his army and threw them into (the flowing water of) the sea and he was blameworthy
And in Aad (there is a sign) when We sent on them the barren wind (for their destruction)
It did not leave anything with which it came (in contact) without making it as if decomposed
And in Samood (there is a sign) when it was said to them, “Enjoy till a (set) time.”
But they revolted against the command of their Fosterer, so the thunderbolt took hold of them while they were seeing
So they were not able to stand nor were they able to defend themselves
And the people of Nuh earlier (to them), they (too) were a transgressing people
And the sky, We constructed it with energy, and We are the Expanders (of it)*. * See notes under Ch. 21, Vs
And the earth, We have spread it. How Excellent are We in making it habitable
And of everything We have created pairs that you may be mindful
So you all run towards Allah, I am a clear warner for you from Him
And do not set up another god with Allah, I am a clear warner for you from Him
Thus, there did not come to those before them any messenger but they said, “A magician or one influenced by jinn.”
Do they recommend this to one another? No, they are a rebellious people
So turn away from them, because you are not blameworthy
And be reminding, because reminding certainly benefits the believers
And I did not create the jinn and mankind but (with the sole purpose) that they should serve Me
do not intend (to get) any provision from them nor do I intend that they should feed Me
Allah is certainly the Provider, Possessor of power, the Strong
So for those who are unjust, (their) portion will certainly be like the portion of their companions, so do not let them ask Me to hasten on (the punishment)
So sorrowful is the state of those who do not believe because of their day which they are threatened with
By the mountain
and the written book
in open pages
and the house that is visited
and the elevated roof
and the overflowing sea
The punishment of your Fosterer will certainly be brought into effect
there will be no one to repel it
The day the sky will whirl (with a) whirl
and the mountains will pass away, passing away
Sorrowful will be the state on that day of those who deny
who playfully (get involved) in idle talk
the day they will be pushed towards the fire (with) a pushing
(It will be said), “This is the fire which you used to deny
Then is it magic, or do you not see
Enter it, then be patient or impatient, it is equal for you, you will be rewarded only for that which you used to do.”
Those who had guarded (against evil) will certainly be in gardens and in happiness
rejoicing because of that which their Fosterer has given them and (because) their Fosterer protected them from the punishment of hell
(It will be said to them), “Eat and drink pleasantly because of that which you used to do.”
(They will), recline on couches arranged in ranks and We will pair them with fair ones with wide beautiful eyes
And those who believe and their descendants who follow (them) in belief, We will unite with them their descendants, and We will not reduce anything from (the reward of) their deeds. Every man is in pledge (security) for that which he has earned
And We will support them with fruit and flesh such as they desire
Therein they will take from one another, a cup in which there will be nothing vain nor any sin
And for them, boys will go around them. (They will be) as if they were hidden pearls
While facing one another they will inquire from each other
saying, “Earlier, while we were among our people we were certainly afraid
but Allah has been gracious to us and has protected us from the punishment of the heat wave
We certainly used to pray to Him earlier, He is certainly the Benign (obliging), the Merciful.”
So be reminding, because by the grace of your Fosterer, you are neither a soothsayer nor one influenced by jinn
Or do they say, “(He is) a poet, for whom we are waiting for an accident of time?”
Say, “Wait, because I am also with you, of those who wait.”
Or do their understandings enjoin them to (utter) this (statement) or are they a rebellious people
Or do they say, “He has invented it?” No, they do not believe
Then let them bring a statement similar to it, (if the Quran can be invented by any human being and) if they are truthful
Or were they created from nothing (or by no one)? Or were they (themselves their) creators
Or did they create the skies and the earth? No, they have no certainty
Or do they have with them the treasures of your Fosterer? Or are they the managers
Or do they have a ladder by (climbing on) which they seek to hear? Then let their listener come with a clear authority
Or has He daughters and for you there are sons
Or do you ask them for a reward so that they are burdened with a debt
Or is (the knowledge of) the unseen with them that they write (it) down
Or do they intend to plot? Then those who do not believe, they (themselves) are under the influence of a plot
Or is there for them a god other than Allah? Glory be to Allah (He is high above) that which they associate as partners (with Him)
And (even) if they see a piece of the sky fall, they would say, “A heaped cloud.”
So leave them till they meet that day of theirs wherein they will fall down senseless
The day their plot will not make them free from anything, nor will they be helped
And for those who are unjust, there will certainly be a punishment besides that, but the majority of them does not know
So wait patiently for the command of your Fosterer, for you are certainly before Our eyes. And glorify your Fosterer by praising (Him) at the time you rise
and in the night glorify Him and after (the disappearance of) the stars
By the star when it sets
Your companion neither went astray nor was he misled
nor does he speak out of (his own) desire
It is nothing but a communication, communicated
One (Jibraeel) severe in strength, made it known to him
(he) possesses vigor so he sought equilibrium
when he was on the high horizon
Then he came near and he came down
and was at a distance of two bows, length or closer
then he communicated to His servant that which he communicated
The heart did not lie (in communicating) what it saw
What ! do you dispute with him as to what he saw
And he indeed saw him (Jibraeel) in another descent
near the farthest lote tree
near which is the garden for staying
when that covered the lote tree which covered
The sight neither deviated nor exceeded the limits
He indeed saw (some) of the greater signs of his Fosterer
Did you (ever) see Al Lat and Al Uzza
and Manat the third (and) the last (idol)
What! for you the males and for Him the females
Then that is an unfair division
They are nothing but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has not sent down any authority. They follow nothing but conjecture and that which their souls desire, though the guidance has come to them from their Fosterer
Or, shall man have what (all) he desires
But Allah’s is the hereafter (future) and the former (past)
And how many an angel is there in the skies, whose recommendation will be of no use in anything, except after Allah gives permission to whom He wills and pleases
Those who do not believe in the hereafter certainly name the angels with female names
and they do not have any knowledge about it, they follow nothing but conjecture, and conjecture is certainly of no use in anything compared to the truth
So keep away from him who turns away from Our remembrance and desires nothing but the life of this world
That is the (ultimate) reach of their knowledge. Your Fosterer certainly knows best, him who goes astray from His way, and He knows best, him who receives guidance
And whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is Allah’s that He may reward those who do evil for that which they did and (that) He may reward those who do good with (something) better
Those who avoid great sins and indecencies except small faults, (then) your Fosterer is certainly Ample in protectively forgiving (them). He knew you best when He produced you from the earth and when you were hidden in the wombs of your mothers, therefore do not attribute purity to yourselves. He knows best him who guards (against evil)
Did you not see him who turns his back
and gives a little and withholds
Has he with him the knowledge of the unseen so that he sees
Or was he not informed of that which was in the books of Musa
and Ibrahim, who fulfilled (his responsibility by informing)
that no bearer of burden will bear the burden of another
and that there is nothing for man except that which he strives for
and that his striving will be seen
then he will be rewarded for it with a full reward
and that towards your Fosterer is the (ultimate) goal
and that it is He Who makes (one) laugh and makes (one) weep
and that it is He Who gives death and gives life
and that He created the pairs, the male and the female
from the sperm when it was poured
and that on Him is (the responsibility of) the later production (creation after death)
and that it is He Who gives riches and satisfaction
and that He is the Fosterer of the (star) Sirius
and that He destroyed the ancient Aad
and Samood, He did not allow to remain
and the people of Nuh earlier, because they were more unjust and more rebellious
and the overthrown cities, He overthrew
so there covered them that which covered
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you dispute about
This is a warner like the ancient warners
The approaching one draws near
none besides Allah can expose it
Do you then wonder at this statement
and you laugh and do not weep
while you are involved in vanities (being heedless of your duty)
Therefore bow down before Allah and serve (Him)
The hour drew near and the moon was split
And if they see a sign they turn away and say, “Magic (of old) repeated.”
And they denied and followed their desires. And every affair has a (set) time/place of happening
And there has come to them (that part) of the news in which there is (a warning for them) to restrain
mature wisdom, but warnings are of no use (to them)
so turn away from them. The day an announcer will call them towards an awful thing put
with their sight humbled, they will come out of the graves, as if they were scattered locusts
hastening with their eyes fixed towards the announcer. The infidels will say, “This is a day of difficulty.”
The people of Nuh denied before them, so they denied Our servant and said, “One influenced by jinn,” and he was scolded and driven away
Then he prayed to his Fosterer, “I am overcome so help me.”
So We opened the gates of the sky with water pouring forth
and We caused the earth to gush forth with springs, so the waters met for (the execution of) an affair already programmed
And We carried him on (the ship) made of planks and nails (or planks tied with palm fibre)
sailing before Our eyes, a reward for him who was rejected
And We left it as a sign, but is there anyone who will mind
Then how (terrible) was My punishment and My warning
And We have indeed made the Quran easy to remember (understand and be mindful), but is there anyone who will mind
Aad denied, then how (terrible) was My punishment and My warning
We sent on them a furious wind during the day (period) of repeated loss
uprooting men as if they were trunks of uprooted date palms
Then how (terrible) was My punishment and My warning
And We have indeed made the Quran easy to remember, but is there anyone who will mind
Samood were deniers of the warnings
so they said, “Should we follow him who is a single man from among us? We will then certainly be in error and madness
Has the reminder been made to come down (only) on him from among (all of) us? No, he is a self interested liar.”
Tomorrow they will know who is a self interested liar
We are sending the she camel as a test for them, so be vigilant (over) them and be patient
And inform them that the water is to be shared between (the she camel and) them, each one should be present (for) the drink (at one’s turn)
But they called their companion, so he took (the sword) then slew (the she camel)
Then how (terrible) was My punishment and My warning
We sent on them a single loud cry so they became like dry broken pieces (of trees used to make) an enclosure (for the cattle or around fields)
And We indeed made the Quran easy to remember, but is there anyone who will mind
The people of Lut were deniers of the warnings
We sent on them a sand storm (or volcanic debris), except the followers of Lut, We delivered them by dawn
A favour from Us, thus do We reward him who is grateful
And he had warned them of Our seizure but they doubted and disputed about the warnings
And they even sought to take away from him his guests (for an evil purpose), but We blinded their eyes, so taste My punishment and My warning
The punishment set (to befall) at its place/time of happening, befell them in the morning
So taste My punishment and My warning
And We indeed made the Quran easy to remember, but is there anyone who will mind
And the warnings came to the people of Firawn
but they were deniers of Our signs, each of them, so We seized them (with a) seizure of One Mighty, Powerful
Are infidels (among) you better than those or is there a freedom for you in the scriptures
Or do they say, “We are a defended army.”
The army will be defeated and they will be made to turn their backs
No, the hour of doom is their promised time and the hour of doom will be most grievous and most bitter
The criminals are certainly in error and madness
On the day they will be dragged into the fire on their faces, (it will be said), “Taste the affliction of hell.”
We have certainly created everything with a programme
And Our command is but one, like the twinkling of an eye
And We indeed destroyed sects (like those of) yours, but is there anyone who will mind
And everything they did, is in the books
and everything small or great is written down (recorded)
Those who guard (against evil) will certainly be in gardens with rivers
in a confirmed seat, near the King, the Holder of power
The Beneficent
He taught the Quran
He created man
He taught him to express (by action, speech, writing etc)
The sun and the moon (function) according to a calculation
And the herbs and the trees bow down (to Him)
And the sky, He has raised it, and He has set the balance
(by ordering) that: Do not exceed (the limits) in the balance
and establish the balance in a just manner and do not reduce the balance
And the earth He has layed down for the cattle (living beings)
Therein are fruits and palm trees (with) sheathed (dates)
and grains with husk and the scented herb
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
He created man from mud, like (that used in) pottery
And He created the jinn from (the heat wave) let free from fire
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Fosterer of the two places/times of sun rise and Fosterer of the two places/times of sun set (at the summer and winter solstice)
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
He let free the two seas (which) meet
(but) between them is a barrier which they do not pass
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
There come out from both of them pearls and corals
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
And His are the ships, with elevated sails, (sailing) in the sea, like mountains
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
All who are on it will perish
and there will remain the Face (Person) of your Fosterer, Possessor of glory and honour
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Whoever is in the skies and the earth asks from Him, everyday (each moment) He is in a state (of intending something or implementing some affair)
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
We will free (Ourselves) for you, O you two weighty (things)
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
O assembly of jinn and mankind! if you are able to pass through the boundaries (or spheres) of the skies and the earth, then pass through, you will not pass through except with authority
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Flames of fire (without smoke) and hot smoke (without flames) will be sent on you both, then you will not be able to defend
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
So when the sky splits and becomes red like red hide
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
So on that day neither man nor jinn will be questioned about his sin
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
The criminals will be recognised by their marks, so they will be caught by the forelocks and feet
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
This is hell which the criminals denied
they will go round between it and between hot boiling water
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
And for him who feared to stand before his Fosterer are two gardens
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Having in them various kinds
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
In both of them are flowing springs
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
In both of them every (kind) of fruit will be in two pairs
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Reclining on spreadings (like bed sheets, carpets etc.) the inner linings of which will be of silk brocade, and the fruits of the two gardens will be near
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
In both of them will be females who restrain their gaze, whom neither man nor jinn touched before them
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
As if they were rubies and corals
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Is the reward of good (something) other than good
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
And besides these two, are two more gardens
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Both, dark green in colour
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
In both of them are two springs gushing forth
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
In both of them are fruits and date palms and pomegranates
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
In both of them are good and beautiful ones
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Fair ones, confined in pavilions
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Whom neither man nor jinn touched before them
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets
So which of the bounties of your Fosterer will you both deny
Blessed is the name of your Fosterer, Possessor of glory and honour
When the event befalls
there is no falsehood in its befalling
(it will) bring down (some and) exalt (others)
When the earth will be shaken (with) a shaking
and the mountains will be crumbled (with) a crumbling
so that they will become as scattered dust
And you will become three kinds
So the companions of the right hand. How will the companions of the right hand be
And the companions of the left hand. How will the companions of the left hand be
And the foremost are the foremost
Those are the persons who will be brought near
in gardens of bliss
numerous from among the ancients
and less from among the later
(they will be) on couches encrusted (with gold and precious stones)
reclining on them facing one another
Youths always staying (in attendance) will go around them
with bowls and beakers and cups (filled with drinks) from a spring
They will not have headache from it nor will they be intoxicated
And (they will have) fruits from what they choose
and flesh of birds from that which they desire
and fair ones with wide beautiful eyes
resembling in likeness, hidden pearls
a reward for that which they used to do
They will hear therein nothing vain or sinful
but the statement, “Peace! Peace!”
And the companions of the right hand. How will the companions of the right hand be
(They will be) among thorn less lote trees
and clustered plantains
and extending shade
and water flowing continuously
and fruits in plenty
neither to be cut off nor forbidden
and raised beds
We have produced them (females, and they are such) creation
that We have made them virgins
loving, equals in age
for the companions of the right hand
Numerous from among the ancients
and numerous from among the later
And the companions of the left hand. How will the companions of the left hand be
(They will be) in hot wind and boiling water
and shadows of black smoke
neither cool nor beneficial
Before that (i.e. in the worldly life) they were well-off
and they used to persist in great sin
and they used to say, “What! when we are dead and become (part of the) soil and bones, shall we indeed be raised (to life again)
and our forefathers (too)?”
Say, “Certainly, the ancients and the later
all will be gathered at the appointed time on the known day.”
Then all of you ! O you who err and deny
you will eat from the tree of Zaqqum
and fill your stomachs with it
then over it you will drink from boiling water
and you will drink (as) a thirsty camel drinks
This will be their entertainment on the day of judgment
We have created you, then why do you not accept the truth
Have you seen (the sperm) which you emit
Is it you who have created it or are We the Creators
We have destined death among you, and We are not to be overcome
in changing your likeness and producing you in (a state), the knowledge of which you do not have
And you indeed know the first creation, so why are you not mindful
Have you seen that which you sow
Is it you who grow (the plants through) it or are We the Growers
Had We willed, We could have made it broken pieces, then you would start wondering
“We are (involved) in a lasting difficulty
no, we are deprived.”
Have you seen the water which you drink
Is it you who send it down from the cloud or are We those Who send it down
Had We willed We could have made it bitter, so why are you not grateful
Have you seen the fire which you kindle
Is it you who produce the tree for it or are We the Producers
We have made it a reminder (probably of hell fire) and a provision for the needy (wayfarer)
So glorify the name of your Great Fosterer
So I do swear by the places of existence of the stars
and that certainly is a great oath, if you only knew
It is certainly an honoured Quran
in a book that is protected
none touch it except those who are clean
sent down from the Fosterer of the worlds
Then is it this statement which (is so important), that you take easy
And you make it your livelihood, that you (go on) denying it
So why is it not that when the (soul) reaches the throat
and you are at that time looking on (waiting)
and We are nearer to the (dying person) than you, but not visible to you
so why is it not, if you are not bound by any law
(that you) bring the (soul) back, if you are truthful
Then if he is from among those near (to Allah)
then (he will have) happiness and fragrance and the garden of bliss
And if he is from among the companions of the right hand
then (it will be said), “Peace for you, from those of the right hand.”
And if he is from among the deniers who are in error
then the entertainment (for him) will be of boiling water
and entry in hell
This indeed is the certain truth
So glorify the name of your Great Fosterer
Whatever is in the skies and the earth glorifies Allah and He is the Mighty, the Wise
His is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, He gives life and causes to die and He has power over everything
He is the First and the Last and the Evident (Outer Most) and the Hidden (Inner Most) and He is the Knower of everything
He it is Who created the skies and the earth in six periods, then He set the balance on the throne (of the universe). He knows that which enters into the earth and that which comes out of it and that which comes down from the sky and that which goes up into it. And He is with you wherever you are and Allah is the Seer of that which you do
His is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, and (all) affairs will be returned to Allah
He causes the night to enter into the day and He causes the day to enter into the night, and He is the Knower of what the bosoms (hearts) possess
Believe in Allah and His messenger and spend from that which He has made you to be successors of. So those who believe from among you and spend, for them there is a great reward
And what (reason is there) for you that you do not believe in Allah when His messenger invites you to believe in your Fosterer, and indeed He has taken a pledge from you, if you are believers
He it is Who sends down clear signs on His servant, that He may bring you out from darkness towards light and Allah is certainly full of pity. Merciful to you
And what (reason is there) for you, that you do not spend in the way of Allah, when Allah’s is the inheritance of the skies and the earth (that is, when everything will go back to Him)? Those among you who spent and fought before the victory (of Mecca) are not equal to, (but) are greater in rank compared to those who spent and fought after (the victory), and to each Allah has promised good, and Allah is informed of that which you do
Who is there who will loan to Allah a good loan so that He will double it for him and for him there will be an honourable reward
One day you will see the believing men and the believing women, their light running before them and on their right hand (side), good news to you this day: gardens beneath which rivers flow, for staying therein. That is the great achievement
That day the hypocrite men and the hypocrite women will say to those who believe, “Wait for us, that we may get light from your light,” it will be said, “Go back to your rear (past life if possible) then seek a light.” Then a wall will be set up between them for which there will be a gate, inside of it there will be mercy and on the outer side of it (there will be) punishment
The (hypocrites) will call out to the (believers), “Were we not with you?” They will say, “Why not! but you yourselves fell into temptation and you hesitated and doubted and your desires deceived you till the command of Allah came, and the deceiver deceived you concerning Allah.”
So on that day no ransom will be accepted from you nor from those who did not believe, your settling place will be the fire, that is your (place of) turning back and it is an evil destination
Has not the time come for those who believe, that their hearts become humbled for the remembrance of Allah and that which Allah has sent down of the truth, and (that) they do not become like those who were given the book earlier? So, as the time passed on them their hearts hardened and many of them were transgressors
Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its death, He makes the signs clear for you that you may understand
The men who give charity and the women who give charity and loan to Allah a good loan. He will certainly double it for them and for them there will be an honourable reward
And those who believe in Allah and His messengers, those are the persons who are truthful. And the witnesses (martyrs) are with their Fosterer, for them is their reward and their light. And those who do not believe and deny Our signs, they are the inhabitants of hell
Know that the life of this world is nothing but sport and pastime and pomp and boasting among yourselves and competition for increase in wealth and children, it is like rain, the growth of vegetation through which pleases the farmer, then it dries up and you see it become yellow, then it becomes broken pieces. And in the hereafter there is severe punishment and protective forgiveness and pleasure from Allah. And the life of this world is nothing but a deceptive provision
Be foremost in (seeking) protective forgiveness from your Fosterer and the garden, the extension of which is like the extension of the sky and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. That is the grace of Allah, He gives it to whom He wills and Allah is the Possessor of great grace
No disaster befalls in the earth nor among yourselves, but it is (recorded) in a book before We bring it into existence, that is certainly easy for Allah
(You are informed of this) so that you may not despair over (matters) which have gone out of your hands (i.e. your failures) nor be exultant because of that which He has given you (of success). And Allah does not like all those who are proud, boastful
who hoard (being niggardly) and enjoin mankind to hoard (being niggardly). And whoever turns away, then Allah is certainly Independent, the Praised
We indeed sent Our messengers with clear proofs and We sent down with them the book (law) and the balance (justice) that mankind may conduct themselves with justice, and We sent down the iron in which is severe strength and other benefits for mankind; and that Allah may know (mark out) him who helps Him and His messengers without seeing (Him), Allah is certainly Strong, Mighty
And We indeed sent Nuh and Ibrahim and appointed the prophet hood and the book (to remain) in their descendants, so among them are those who are guided and many of them are transgressors
Then We made Our messengers to follow in their footsteps and We made Isa, the son of Maryam, to follow and gave him the Injeel, and placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. And they invented monasticism*, We did not prescribe it for them, only to seek Allah’s pleasure, but they did not observe it with the observation due to it. So We gave to those who believed from among them, their reward, and most of them are transgressors. * Seclusion from worldly life. him. And they invented monasticism*, We did not prescribe it for them, only to seek Allah’s pleasure, but they did not observe it with the observation due to it. So We gave to those who believed from among them, their reward, and most of them are transgressors. * Seclusion from worldly life
O you who believe ! fear Allah and believe in His messenger, He will give you a double portion of His mercy and He will appoint for you a light through which you will walk and He will protectively forgive you and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
that the owners of the book may know that they do not have control on anything from the grace of Allah and that the bounty is in Allah's hand, He gives it to whom He wills and Allah is the Possessor of great grace
Allah has heard the statement of her who pleads with you concerning her husband and complains to Allah, and Allah was hearing the conversation of you both, Allah is certainly Hearing, Seeing
Those of you who do not go near their wives calling them their mothers, they are not their mothers, their mothers are none other than those who gave them birth. And they certainly say something unrecognised (as good) in speech, and a lie, and Allah is certainly Pardoning, Protectively Forgiving
And those who do not go near their wives calling them their mothers, then (afterwards if they intend to) go back on what they said, they should free a slave before they touch each other, that is what you are admonished with, and Allah is informed of what you do
But he who does not find (a slave) then he should fast for two months successively before they touch each other, but he who is not capable (to fast), should feed sixty needy ones. That (should be done, if you claim) that you believe in Allah and His messenger, and those are the limits of Allah. And there will be a painful punishment for the infidels. be a painful punishment for the infidels
Those who resist Allah and His messenger will certainly be disgraced as those before them were disgraced. And We indeed sent down clear signs, and there will be a disgraceful punishment for the infidels
One day Allah will raise all of them (to life) then inform them about that which they did. Allah has computed it while they have forgotten it, and Allah is the Witness over everything
Did they not consider that Allah knows whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth. There is no secret talk (between) three but He is the fourth of them nor (between) five but He is the sixth of them , nor less than that nor more but He is with them wherever they are, then on the day of resurrection He will inform them about that which they did, Allah is certainly the Knower of everything
Did you not see towards those who were forbidden from secret talks, then (again) they return to that which they were forbidden, and they hold secret talks for sin and transgression and disobedience to the messenger. And when they come to you, they greet you with (a greeting) with which Allah does not greet you, and they say among themselves, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” Hell is enough for them, they will enter it, so evil is (their) destination
O you who believe ! when you hold secret talks, then do not hold (these) secret talks for sin and transgression and disobedience to the messenger, but hold secret talks for righteousness and guarding (against evil) and fear Allah towards Whom you will be gathered
The secret talks (i.e. the evil suggestions) of the devil are only to grieve those who believe but he cannot harm them in anything, except with Allah’s permission, so let the believers put their trust in Allah
O you who believe! when it is said to you “Make room in assemblies,” then make room, Allah will make room for you. And when it is said, “Rise up,” then rise up, Allah will exalt in degrees those who believe from among you and those who are given knowledge, and Allah is informed of that which you do
O you who believe! when you secretly consult the messenger, then give charity in advance, before your secret consultation (with him). That is better for you and cleaner, but if you do not find (anything to give in charity) then Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Are you afraid of giving charity in advance, before your secret consultation? So when you do not do it, and (when) Allah has turned to you (mercifully), then establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and obey Allah and His messenger and Allah is informed of that which you do
Did you not consider those who turn (for friendship towards)a people on whom is Allah’s anger? They are neither of you nor of them and they swear over falsehood while they know
Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them, that which they do is certainly evil
They take their oaths as a shelter (for their evil) and turn away (people) from the way of Allah, therefore, there will be a disgraceful punishment for them
Their wealth and their children will be of no use to them in anything against Allah, they are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay therein
The day Allah will raise all of them (to life) then they will swear to Him as they swear to you and they will think that they are on something (firm by their swearing). Beware ! they are the liars
The devil has cast his influence over them so he has made them to forget the remembrance of Allah. Those are (the members of) the team of the devil. Beware! the (members of) the team of the devil, they are certainly the losers
Those who resist Allah and His messenger, they are certainly among the most disgraced
Allah has decreed, “I and My messengers will definitely prevail.” Allah is certainly Strong, Mighty
You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the period hereafter, loving those who resist Allah and His messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their relatives (and friends). Those are the persons in whose hearts He has written down belief and has strengthened them with a spirit from Him. And He will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, to stay therein, Allah pleased with them and they pleased with Him. Those are (the members of) the team of Allah. Beware ! (the members of) the team of Allah, they are the successful ones
Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah and He is the Mighty, the Wise
He it is Who caused the driving out of those who did not believe from among the owners of the book, from their houses at the first gathering for exile. You did not expect that they will go out while they expected that their fortresses would defend them against Allah, but Allah came to them (to punish them) from a place which they could not (even) imagine, and He cast terror into their hearts so that their houses were ruined with their own hands and the hands of the believers, so learn a lesson O you who have insight
And if Allah had not decreed exile for them He would have punished them in this world, and in the hereafter they will have the punishment of fire
That is because they opposed Allah and His messenger, and whoever opposes Allah then Allah is certainly severe in requiting
Whatever date palms you cut down or left them standing on their roots, it was by Allah’s permission, so that (through it) He might disgrace the transgressors
And whatever Allah made His messenger to take from them, you did not make any horse or riding camel to run for (achieving) it, but Allah gives authority to His messengers over whom He wills and Allah has power over everything
Whatever Allah made His messenger to take from the people of the towns, it is for Allah and for His messenger and for the possessors of relationship and the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer, so that the (wealth) may not become an item of circulation (only) between the rich among you. And take that which the messenger gives you and that which he withholds from you, you (too) withhold (yourselves from it), and fear Allah, Allah is certainly severe in requiting
(It is) for the poor immigrants who were driven out from their houses and their possessions, seeking the grace of Allah and His pleasure, and they helped Allah and His messenger, those are the persons who are truthful
And those who were settled in houses (in Madina) and (in) belief, before the (migrants from Mecca), they love those who migrated towards them and do not find in their hearts any need of that which is given to the (migrants) and prefer them over themselves even if they are in need, and one who is saved from the selfishness of his soul, then those are the persons who are successful
And those who came after them say, “Our Fosterer ! protectively forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in belief and do not let any ill feeling be present in our hearts for those who believe. Our Fosterer ! You are certainly full of pity, Merciful.”
Did you not see those hypocrites who say to their brothers who do not believe from among the owners of the book, “If you are driven out we (too) will definitely go out with you and we will never obey anyone against you and if you are attacked in fighting, we will definitely help you.” And Allah is a Witness that they are certainly liars
If they are driven out they will not go out with them and if they are attacked in fighting they will not help them and if (at all) they help them, they will definitely turn their backs, then they will not be helped. help them, they will definitely turn their backs, then they will not be helped
Terror on account of you is stronger in their hearts than that due to Allah, that is because they are a people who do not understand
(Even) all of them combined together will not fight with you, except (after taking shelter) in fortified towns or from behind walls, their fighting among themselves is severe, you think that they are united whereas their hearts are disunited, that is because they are people who have no sense
(They are) similar in likeness to those who were just before them (and) who tasted the evil result of their affair, and for them there is a painful punishment
(They are) similar in likeness to the devil when he says to man, “Reject (the truth),” but when he rejects, he says, “I am free of you I am certainly afraid of Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds.”
Therefore the end of both will be that, both of them will be in the fire, staying therein, and that is the reward of those who are unjust
O you who believe ! fear Allah, and let every soul look to what it has sent in advance for the morrow (future) and fear Allah, Allah is certainly informed of that which you do
And do not be like those who forgot Allah, so He made them forget themselves, those are the persons who transgress
Inhabitants of the fire and inhabitants of the garden are not equal, the inhabitants of the garden, they are the achievers
If We had sent down this Quran on a mountain, you would have seen it fallen down splitting asunder due to the fear of Allah. And these are similitude’s We set forth for mankind that they may reflect*. * See note under Chapter 25, Verse
Allah is He, besides Whom there is no god, Knower of the unseen and the seen, He is the Beneficent, the Merciful
Allah is He, besides Whom there is no god, the King, the Holy, the Author of peace, the Granter of security, the Guardian, the Mighty, the Compeller, the Possessor of greatness; glorified be Allah above what they associate as partners (with Him)
Allah is He (Who is) the Creator, the Purifier, the Fashioner, His are the most beautiful names, whatever is in the skies and the earth glorifies Him and He is the Mighty, the Wise
O you who believe! do not take My enemy and your enemy as friends offering them love while they reject that which has come to you of the truth, driving out the messenger and you (just) because you believe in Allah your Fosterer. If you have come out for striving in My way and seeking My pleasure (why) do you offer them love in secret? And I know best that which you hide and that which you make public. And whoever from among you does that, then he has indeed gone astray from the balanced way
If they dominate you, they will be your enemies, and they will stretch towards you their hands and their tongues with evil, and they like that you (too should) reject (the truth)
Your blood relatives and your children will not be of any benefit to you on the day of resurrection, He will decide between you, and Allah is the Seer of that which you do
There is indeed a good example for you to follow, in Ibrahim and those with him when they said to their people, “We are free of you and that which you worship besides Allah, we do not believe with you, and enmity and hatred has become manifest between us and you for ever, unless you (too) believe in Allah Who is One,” but for the word of Ibrahim to his father, “I will definitely ask protective forgiveness for you though I do not control for you anything from Allah. Our Fosterer! in You do we put our trust and towards You do we turn and towards You is the destination
Our Fosterer ! do not make us (an item of) trial for those who do not believe and protect us, our Fosterer! You are certainly the Mighty, the Wise.”
There is certainly a good example in them for you to follow, for him who hopes (facing) Allah and the period hereafter; and he who turns away, then Allah is certainly Independent, the Praised. ereafter; and he who turns away, then Allah is certainly Independent, the Praised
It may be that Allah will (inspire) love between you and those of them who are your enemies, and Allah is Powerful and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Allah does not forbid you, with regard to those who do not fight with you on account of (your) religion nor drive you out of your houses, (from) being kind to them and dealing justly with them, Allah certainly loves those who are just
Allah forbids you, only with regard to those who fight with you on account of (your) religion and drive you out of your houses and help (others) in driving you out,(from) making friendship with them, and whoever makes friendship with them, then those are the persons who are unjust
O you who believe ! when believing immigrant women come to you then examine them, Allah knows best their belief, but if you (too) know them to be believers then do not return them to the infidels, they are not lawful for them nor the (infidels) are lawful for them and give the (infidels) that which they have spent (on them), and there is no sin on you to marry them when you give them their dowries. And do not retain the ties of marriage with the infidel women. And ask for (the return of) that which you have spent and let them ask for (the return of) that which they have spent, that is the judgment of Allah (with which) He judges between you and Allah is Knowing, Wise
And if anything through your wives (who deserted you) has gone from you to the infidels, then when your turn comes (and you receive wealth from the infidels, then) give to those whose wives have gone, the like of that which they had spent, and fear Allah, in Whom you believe
O prophet! when believing women come to you to take an oath of allegiance unto you that they will not associate anything with Allah and they will not steal and they will not commit adultery and they will not kill their children and they will not come with a false charge (on someone), forging it between their hands and their feet, and they will not disobey you in (what) is recognised (as good), then accept their allegiance and ask Allah for their protective forgiveness, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
O you who believe! do not make friendship with a people on whom is Allah’s anger, they are indeed in despair about the hereafter as the infidels are in despair about those who are in graves
Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah and He is the Mighty, the Wise
O you who believe! why do you say that which you do not do
It is most hateful to Allah that you say that which you do not do
Allah certainly loves those who fight in His way in ranks as if they were a solid structure
And (remember) when Musa said to his people, “O my people! why do you annoy me when you indeed know that I am a messenger of Allah (sent) to you?” So when they deviated from the right Allah (also) deviated their hearts from the right and Allah does not guide a transgressing people
And (remember) when Isa, the son of Maryam, said, “O children of Israel! I am a messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming that which is before me of the Torah and conveying the good news of a messenger who will come after me, his name being Ahmed (Muhammed).” But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, “This is clear magic.”
And who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah when he is invited towards Islam? And Allah does not guide an unjust people
They intend to put out the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light even though the infidels may dislike
He it is Who has sent His messenger with guidance and the religion of truth that He may make it prevail over every (other) religion, even though the polytheists may dislike
O you who believe! shall I lead you to a commerce that will save you from the painful punishment
You believe in Allah and His messenger and strive in the way of Allah with your wealth and your persons, that is better for you if you (could only) know
He will protectively forgive you your sins and make you enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, and pleasant dwellings in gardens of everlasting bliss, that is a great achievement
And another (reward) which you love, help from Allah and a near victory, and convey good news to the believers
O you who believe! be helpers of Allah: as Isa, the son of Maryam, had said to the disciples, “Who are my helpers in (the cause of) Allah?” The disciples said, “We are the helpers of Allah.” So a party of the children of Israel believed and a party did not believe. Then We strengthened those who believed, against their enemy, so they became victorious
Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth, glorifies Allah, the King, the Holy, the Mighty, the Wise
He it is Who raised among the unlettered, a messenger from among them, he recites to them His signs and purifies them and teaches them the book (the law) and the wisdom, (interpretation of the law) and earlier they were in clear error
and (will do so to) others (too) from among those who have not yet joined them. And He is the Mighty, the Wise
That is the grace of Allah, He gives it to whom He wills, and Allah is the Possessor of great grace
The likeness of those who were (entrusted) with the burden (of implementing) the Torah then they did not bear this burden, is like the likeness of a donkey which bears the burden of books. Evil is the likeness of the people who deny the signs of Allah. And Allah does not guide the unjust people
Say, “O you who are Jews ! if you claim that you are the friends of Allah to the exclusion of other human beings, then desire for death, if you are truthful.”
But they will never desire for it because of that which their hands have sent in advance, and Allah is the Knower of those who are unjust
Say, “The death from which you run away will certainly meet you, then you will be turned towards the Knower of the unseen and the seen and He will inform you of that which you used to do.”
O you who believe ! when you are called for the congregational worship (salat) on Friday, hasten towards the remembrance of Allah and leave off trading (all business), that is better for you, if you (could only) know
Then when you complete the worship (salat), disperse in the earth and seek from Allah’s grace, and remember Allah much that you may be successful
And when they see any commerce or pastime, they disperse towards it and leave you standing. Say, “That which is with Allah is better than pastime and commerce and Allah is the Best of providers.”
When the hypocrites come to you they say, “We bear witness that you are certainly a messenger of Allah.” And Allah knows that you are certainly His messenger and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are certainly liars (because they do not mean what they say)
They make their oaths a shelter (and) thus turn away (people) from the way of Allah, evil is that which they do
That is because they believed then became infidels, so a seal was set on their hearts, therefore they do not understand
And when you see them, their personalities please you and if they speak, you listen to their speech. They are like beams of wood covered with (attractive) garments, they think that every loud cry is against them, they are the enemies, so beware of them. May Allah kill them, how they are turned away (from the truth)! are turned away (from the truth)
And when it is said to them, “Come, the messenger of Allah will seek protective forgiveness for you,” they turn their heads and you see them turning away and they consider themselves great
It is equal for them, whether you seek protective forgiveness for them or do not seek protective forgiveness for them, Allah will never forgive them. Allah certainly does not guide the transgressing people
They are the persons who say, “Do not spend on those who are with the messenger of Allah until they leave (him),” though the treasures of the skies and the earth are Allah’s but the hypocrites do not understand
They say, “If we return to Madina, the mightier will definitely drive out the weaker,” though might belongs to Allah and His messenger and the believers, but the hypocrites do not know
O you who believe! do not let your wealth and your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah, and whoever does that, then those are the persons at loss
And spend from that which We have provided you, before death comes to one of you (and) then he says, “My Fosterer! why do you not postpone (this) for me till a near term so that I could give charity and become one of the righteous?”
And Allah never postpones (death for) any soul when its term comes (to an end), and Allah is informed of that which you do
Whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth glorifies Allah, His is the kingdom and to Him is due (all) praise and He has power over everything
He it is Who created you, but one of you is an infidel and one of you is a believer, and Allah is a Seer of that which you do
He created the skies and the earth in reality, and He gave you form and made your forms good, and towards Him is the destination
He knows whatever is in the skies and the earth and He knows that which you hide and that which you make public and Allah is the Knower of what the bosoms (hearts) possess
Has not the news come to you of those who did not believe before (you)? So they tasted the evil result of their affair and for them there is a painful punishment
That was because there came to them their messengers with clear proofs but they said, “Shall human beings guide us?” So they became infidels and turned away, therefore Allah (too) became unconcerned and Allah is Independent, Praised
Those who do not believe, claim that they will never be raised (after their death). Say, “Why not! by my Fosterer! you will definitely be raised, then you will be informed of that which you did and that is easy for Allah.”
So believe in Allah and His messenger and the light which We have sent down and Allah is informed of that which you do
The day He will gather you for the day of gathering, that will be the day of manifestation of misappropriations. And whoever believes in Allah and does righteous work, He will remove from him his evil deeds and He will make him enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, for staying therein for ever. That is the great achievement
And those who do not believe and deny Our signs, those are the inhabitants of the fire, they will stay therein and it is an evil destination
No disaster befalls except by Allah’s permission and whoever believes in Allah, He guides his heart and Allah is the Knower of everything
And obey Allah and obey the messenger but if you turn away then the responsibility of Our messenger is only to convey (the message) clearly
Allah, there is no god except Him, so let the believers put their trust in Allah
O you who believe! some of your wives and your children are certainly your enemies, so be cautious of them, and if you pardon and overlook and protectively forgive, then Allah (too) is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Your wealth and your children are only a trial, and there is a great reward with Allah
So fear Allah as much as you can and listen and obey and spend, that is better for your souls; and one who is saved from the selfishness of his soul, then those are the persons who are successful
If you loan to Allah a good loan, He will double it for you and He will protectively forgive you, and Allah is One Who acknowledges Clement (Gentle)
Knower of the unseen and the seen, the Mighty, the Wise
O prophet! when you divorce women then divorce them for their prescribed term and calculate the prescribed term and fear Allah your Fosterer. Do not drive them out from their houses nor should they themselves go out, unless they commit an open indecency. And those are the limits of Allah and whoever transgresses the limits of Allah, he has indeed been unjust to his own soul, you do not know, perhaps Allah may bring about an event (of reunion) after that
So when they reach (the end of) their term, then either hold them in a recognised (good manner) or separate them in a recognised (good manner). And call to witness two just men from among you and establish (correct) evidence for (the sake of) Allah. With that is advised he who believes in Allah and the period hereafter, and whoever fears Allah He will make for him a way out
and He will provide him from a place unthought of. And whoever puts his trust in Allah, then He is sufficient for him. Allah certainly fulfils His command, Allah has indeed made a programme for everything
And for those of your women who have passed the age of menstruation, if you have a doubt, then their prescribed term is three months, and for those (too) who have not (yet started to) menstruate. And for the pregnant women, their prescribed term is till they lay down their burden. And whoever fears Allah, He makes his affair easy for him
That is the commandment of Allah, He has sent it down to you. And whoever fears Allah, He will remove from him his evil deeds and enlarge for him the reward
Make the (divorced) women dwell (during the prescribed term) where you dwell, according to your means, and do not harm them so as to cause distress to them. And if they are pregnant then spend on them till they lay down their burden, then if they suckle (the child) for you then give them their due payment and consult among yourselves in a recognised (good manner) and if you face some difficulty, then let another (woman) suckle (the child) for him (the responsibility of payment being on the father)
Let him who has abundance spend out of his abundance, and one who has his provision straitened on him, let him spend from that which Allah has given to him. Allah does not task a soul but (to the extent of) that which He has given it. Allah will make (things) easy after difficulty
And how many a town revolted against the commandment of its Fosterer and His messengers, so We called it to account (that too) a severe account and We punished it (with) a severe punishment
So it tasted the evil result of its affair and at the end of its affair, there was loss
Allah has prepared a severe punishment for them, so fear Allah, O men of understanding who believe ! Allah has sent down to you a reminder
(through) a messenger who recites to you clear signs of Allah, so as to bring out those who believe and do righteous works, from darkness towards light. And whoever believes in Allah and does righteous work, He will make him enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, to stay therein for ever. Allah has made a better provision for him
Allah is He Who created the seven skies (seven higher levels), and of the earth (seven lower levels) similar to those (of the skies) . The commandment (of Allah) comes down among them that you may know that Allah has power over everything and that Allah has encompassed everything in (His) knowledge
O prophet! why do you hold unlawful that which Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives, and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
Allah has indeed appointed for you (the procedure for the) dissolution of your oaths*, and Allah is your Guardian and He is the Knowing, the Wise. Chapter 5, Verse
And when the prophet secretly (communicated details of) an event to one of his wives, but when she informed (others) about it and Allah made it known to him, he made known (to her, in turn) a part of it and avoided a part. So when he informed her about it she said, “Who informed you of this?” He said, “The Knower, the Informed, gave me the news.” part of it and avoided a part. So when he informed her about it she said, “Who informed you of this?” He said, “The Knower, the Informed, gave me the news.”
If both of you turn to Allah (in repentance), then indeed your hearts are inclined, and if you help each other against him, then certainly Allah is his Guardian and Jibreel and the righteous believers and besides that, the angels (are there for his) help
Maybe his Fosterer, if he divorces you, will give him in your place, wives better than you:(Those who are) submissive, believing, obeying, penitent, worshipping, fasting, widows and virgins
O you who believe ! save yourselves and your people from a fire, the fuel of which is human beings and stones, over it are angels stern, severe, who do not disobey Allah in that which He commands them (to do) and they do as they are commanded
O you who do not believe ! do not make (any) excuse this day, you will be rewarded only for that which you used to do
O you who believe ! turn towards Allah with sincere repentance, perhaps your Fosterer will remove from you (the effect of) your evil deeds and make you enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not disgrace the prophet and those who believed with him, their light will be running before them and on their right hands, they will say, “Our Fosterer ! perfect our light for us and protectively forgive us, You certainly have power over everything.”
O prophet ! strive against the infidels and the hypocrites and be stern with them, and their settling place is hell and it is an evil destination
Allah sets forth an example for those who do not believe: the wife of Nuh and the wife of Lut, they were under Our two servants from among Our righteous servants but they betrayed them, so (their being wives of prophets) could not make them free from any (punishment) from Allah and it was said, “Enter the fire with those who enter.” it was said, “Enter the fire with those who enter.”
And Allah sets forth an example for those who believe: the wife of Firawn when she said, “My Fosterer! build for me a house in Your nearness in the garden and deliver me from Firawn and his work and deliver me from the unjust people.”
And Maryam, the daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into it (her body), from Our spirit and she testified to the truth of the words other Fosterer and His books and she was among the obedient ones
Blessed is He in Whose hand is the kingdom (of the universe) and He has power over everything
Who created death and life to test you (as to) which of you is best in deeds, and He is the Mighty, the Protectively Forgiving
Who created the seven skies (higher levels) in accordance with each other, you do not see in the creation of the Beneficent (Allah) any discordance, then look again. Do you see any rifts (discontinuity)
Then look again and yet again, your sight will return to you defeated (in its purpose) and it will be tired
And We adorned the sky of the world with lamps and We made them missiles for the devils and We have prepared for them the punishment of blazing fire
And for those who do not believe in their Fosterer, is the punishment of hell and it is an evil destination
When they will be thrown into it, they will hear its roaring and it will blaze
almost bursting with fury. Whenever a batch is thrown into it, its guards will ask them, “Did no warner come to you?”
They will say, “Why not! a warner had indeed come to us, but we denied and we said: Allah has not sent down anything, you are in nothing but great error.”
And they will say, “Had we but listened or understood, we would not have been among the inhabitants of blazing fire.”
So they will confess their sins, therefore away with the inhabitants of the blazing fire
Those who fear their Fosterer without having seen (Him), for them there is certainly protective forgiveness and a great reward
And (whether) you hide your word or manifest it, He is the Knower of what the bosoms (hearts) possess
Will He Who created not know, when He is the Subtilely Informed
He it is Who has made the earth subdued for you, so move about in its surroundings and eat from His provision and to Him will be the return after death
Or are you secure from Him Who is in the sky, that He will (not) make the earth sink with you when it is repeatedly shaken (during an earth quake)
Or are you secure from Him Who is in the sky, that He will (not) send on you a sandstorm (or volcanic debris)? Then you will know how My warning was
And those before them indeed denied, then how was My rejection (of them)
Or did they not see towards the birds above them, spreading and contracting (their wings)? No one holds them except the Beneficent (Allah), He is certainly the Seer of everything
Or who is it that will act as an army for you to help you, besides the Beneficent (Allah)? The infidels are in nothing but deception
Or who is it who will provide for you if He withholds His provision? No, they persist in revolt and hatred
Then, is he who walks headlong on his face better guided or he who walks balanced (on his feet and) on the straight path
Say, “He it is Who produced you and made for you (the faculties of) hearing and seeing and the hearts, little is the gratitude you show.”
Say, “He it is Who has multiplied (and spread) you in the earth and towards Him you will be gathered.”
And they say, “When will this promise (be fulfilled) if you are truthful?”
Say, “The knowledge (of it) is only with Allah and I am only a clear warner.”
So when they see it near, the faces of those who did not believe will be grieved and it will be said, “This is what you used to ask for.”
Say, “Have you considered, Allah can destroy me and those with me or be merciful to us, but who will protect the infidels from the painful punishment?”
Say, “He is the Beneficent, we believe in Him and put our trust in Him, so you will come to know who it is that is in clear error.”
Say, “Have you considered, if your water were to go down, then who will bring flowing water?”
Noon. By the pen and that which they write (with it)
by the grace of your Fosterer you are not under the influence of the jinn
And there is certainly a reward for you, which will never fail
And you are certainly of an exalted character
So you will see and they (too) will see (as to)
which of you is afflicted (with madness)
Your Fosterer certainly knows best him who has gone astray from His way and He knows best those who receive guidance
So do not obey the liars
they like that you should compromise, so that they (too) would compromise
And do not obey any disgraceful person who swears much
defamer, going about spreading slander
forbidder of good, exceeder of limits, sinful
merciless, besides that, mean
because he possesses wealth and sons
When Our signs are recited to him, he says, “Stories of the ancient.”
We will brand him on the nose
We tried them as We tried the inhabitants of the garden when they swore that they would pluck its fruit in the morning
and they did not like to keep aside (a portion for the poor)
So there went around it, a circuit (of disaster) from your Fosterer while they were asleep
so that the (garden) became as if (it was already) plucked
And they cried out to each other in the morning
saying, “Go to your field in the morning, if you are to pluck (the fruits).”
So they went whispering to one another
that, “No poor man shall enter it today (to beg) from you.”
And (when they went) in the morning, (they presumed that) they had power on their determination (to pluck the fruit)
but when they saw it, they said, “We are certainly in error
no, we are those who have been deprived (of receiving the benefit of our labour).”
One balanced among them said, “Did I not tell you? Had you glorified (by regarding Allah above all, this would not have happened).”
They said, “Glorified be our Fosterer, we were certainly unjust.”
Then they turned, some blaming the others
They said, “Sorrowful is our state, we were rebellious
it may be that our Fosterer will give us in exchange, a better (garden) than this; to our Fosterer (we turn as) seekers (of His grace).”
Such was the punishment, and the punishment of the hereafter is greater, had they but known
For those who guard (against evil), there will certainly be gardens of bliss with their Fosterer
Shall We make those who submit (as Muslims), like the criminals
What is (wrong) with you? How do you judge
Or have you a book through which you learn
that you shall have therein what you choose
Or do you have an agreement from Us which extends till the day of resurrection that you will have what you order (for)
Ask them, which of them will be a claimant of that
Or have they partners? Then let them bring their partners if they are truthful
On the day (the covering) will be removed from the ankle (there being a calamity), and they will be called for prostrations, but they will not be able to (prostrate)
their looks will be humbled, disgrace will cover them. And indeed they used to be called for prostrations when they were sound, (but they used to refuse)
So leave Me and him who denies this statement, We will gradually catch them from such a position that they will not know
And I give them time, My plot is certainly firm
Do you ask them for a reward so that they are burdened with a lasting difficulty
Or is (the knowledge of) the unseen with them, so that they write (it) down
So wait patiently for the command of your Fosterer and do not be like the companion of the fish (Yunus) when he called out while he was in grief
Had the favour of his Fosterer not reached him, he would have been (left) cast on the naked shore while he was blamed
Then his Fosterer chose him and made him of the righteous
And those who do not believe, when they hear the reminder, (give such an impression) by their looks that they would almost pull you down from your position and say, “He is indeed under the influence of the jinn.”
And this is nothing but a reminder to the worlds
The truth
What is the truth
And what will make you realize what the truth is
Samood and Aad denied the disaster
So as for Samood, they were destroyed by the thunder and lightning
And as for Aad, they were destroyed by a violently furious wind
which He imposed on them for seven nights and eight days continuously, so that you could see people lying therein, overthrown as if they were the hollow trunks of date palms
So do you see anyone of them remaining
And Firawn and those before him and the overthrown cities, (all) were involved in faults
so they disobeyed the messenger of their Fosterer therefore He seized them with a severe seizure
When the water overflowed We carried you in the ship
so as to make it a reminder for you and that remembering ears may keep it in memory
So when it will be blown into the trumpet (structure of the universe, with) a single blowing
and the earth will be carried away with the mountains then crushed to pieces with a single crushing
then on that day the event will befall
And the sky will be split asunder, so that day it will be weak
And the angels will be on its sides, and on that day, eight will bear the throne of your Fosterer above them
On that day all of you will be presented, no secret of yours will be hidden
So, as for him who is given his record in his right hand, he will say, “Take read my record
I was expecting that I would certainly encounter my account (of deeds).”
So he will be in a pleasant life
in a high garden
the clusters of which will be near
(It will be said to him), “Eat and drink pleasantly because of that which you sent before you during the days that are gone (i.e. during the life of the world).”
And as for him who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, “I wish my record had not been given to me
and I had not known what my account (of deeds) was
wish the (death) had made an end of me
my wealth has not made me carefree from (this)
my authority has gone away from me.”
(It will be said), “Catch him then chain him
then make him enter the hell
then make him to enter into a chain, the length of which is seventy cubits*. * The length of the forearm from the elbow to the extremity of the middle finger
He had not believed in Allah, the Great
and he had not urged on the feeding of the poor
so he (too) this day, has no intimate friend here
nor any food except the corruption from the washings of wounds
none will eat it except the defaulters.”
So I do swear by that which you see
and that which you do not see (that)
This (Quran) is certainly the word of an honoured messenger
and it is not a word of a poet, little is it that you believe
and it is not a word of a soothsayer, little is it that you mind
(it has been) sent down from the Fosterer of the worlds
And had he said some words about Us on his own behalf (and attributed them to Us, then)
We would have seized him by his right hand
then We would have cut off the artery of his heart
and not one of you could have withheld Us from him
And it is certainly a reminder for those who guard (against evil)
And We certainly know that among you are deniers
And it will certainly be (a source of) regret for the infidels
And surely it is the truth (deserving) certainty
So glorify the name of your Great Fosterer
A questioner asked about the punishment to fall
For the infidels, there will be no defender for it
(It will be) from Allah, Possessor of the ways of ascent
The angels and the spirit ascend to Him, in a day (period), the measure of which is fifty thousand years
So be patient with the patience that is good
They certainly see it far
while We see it near
The day when the sky will become like molten brass
and the mountains will be like coloured wool
and (even) an intimate friend will not inquire from another intimate friend
(though) they will be made to see each other. The criminal would love to ransom himself from the punishment of that day by (sacrificing even) his sons
and his wife and his brother
and his family which gave him shelter
and whosoever is in the earth, all, (and) then save himself
By no means ! it is certainly a flaming fire
taking off the skin
It will invite him who turned back (from the truth) and went away
and amassed (wealth) then withheld (it)
Man is certainly hasty (by) character
when evil afflicts him he is impatient
and when good (even) touches him (he) is niggardly
except the worshippers (those who offer salat)
who are constant at their worship (salat)
and in whose wealth there is a known (portion as the) right
of one who asks and of one who is deprived (yet does not ask)
and those who accept the truth of the day of judgment
and those who are fearful of the punishment of their Fosterer
the punishment of their Fosterer is certainly (something from which) one should not feel secure
and those who guard their private parts
except from their wives or whom their right hands possess, so in their case they are not to be blamed
but whoever seeks (something) beyond that, then those are the persons who are transgressors
and those who are faithful to their trusts and their agreements
and those who stand firm on their testimonies
and those who are custodians of their worship (salat)
They will be honoured in gardens
So what is the matter with those who do not believe that they rush towards you
from your right and from your left, in groups
Does every man among them hope that he will be made to enter the garden of bliss
By no means ! they know (the thing) from which We created them
So I do swear by the Fosterer of the rising places/times and setting places/times (of the sun), that We are certainly able
to replace (them by others) better than them and We are not to be overcome
So leave them involved in idle talk and play, till they meet their day which they are promised
The day they will come out from their graves in haste, as if rushing towards a goal
(with) their eyes humbled, disgrace covering them, that is the day which they were promised
We had sent Nuh to his people, (saying), “Warn your people before a painful punishment comes on them.”
He said, “O my people ! I am a clear warner to you
that you should serve (worship) Allah and fear Him and obey me
He will (for give and) protect you from your sins and give you time till an appointed term. When the term of Allah comes (to an end), it will certainly not be postponed, had you but known.”
He said, “My Fosterer! I invited my people (towards You) night and day
but my invitation did not increase in them anything except running away (from the truth)
And whenever I invited them that You will protectively forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears and covered, themselves with garments and persisted (in refusing) and considered themselves great (due to) pride
Then I invited them aloud
then I invited them publicly and secretly in private
then I said: Seek protective forgiveness of your Fosterer, He is certainly Protectively Forgiving
He will send on you abundant rain from the sky
and will help you with wealth and sons and He will make gardens for you and He will make rivers for you
What is (wrong) with you, do you not expect Allah to be serious (about the above promises)
And He has created you (through) different stages
Did you not consider how Allah created the seven skies (higher levels) in accordance with each other
and made the moon therein (a source of reflected) light and made the sun a lamp
And Allah caused you to grow from the earth (as a) growth
then He returns you into it and He will bring you out, a bringing out
And Allah has made the earth a wide expanse for you
that you may move therein on wide ways.”
Nuh said, “My Fosterer, they disobeyed me, and followed him whose wealth and children added to him nothing but loss
And they planned a great plan
And they said: Do not leave your gods, nor leave Wadd, nor Suwa nor Yagus and Yauq and Nasr* *Names of false gods (deities)
And they have misled many, and You do not (give) increase to the unjust persons in anything but error.”
They were drowned because of their faults, then made to enter the fire, and they did not find for themselves any helpers besides Allah
And Nuh said, “My Fosterer! do not leave on the earth any dweller from among the infidels
for if you leave them they will mislead your servants and they will not give birth to any but transgressing, ungrateful (children)
My Fosterer ! protectively forgive me and my parents and him who enters my house as a believer, and the believing men and the believing women and do not (give) increase to the unjust persons, in anything but ruin.”
Say: It is communicated to me that a party of the jinn heard (the Quran) and said, “We have heard a wonderful Quran
It guides to the right way, so we have believed in it and we will never associate any partner with our Fosterer
And Exalted be the Majesty of our Fosterer, He has not taken a wife or a son
And the foolish among us used to say unjust (things) about Allah
And we thought that mankind and jinn never speak a lie against Allah
And persons from among human beings used to seek protection of persons from among the jinn so they increased them in error
And they (too) thought as you thought that Allah will never raise anyone (to life after death)
And we searched the sky but found it filled with strong guards and flames
And we used to sit in some of the sitting places thereof to hear, but now whoever hears, he finds a flame waiting for him
And we do not know whether evil is intended for those who are in the earth or their Fosterer intends (to guide) them to the right way
And among us are those who are righteous and among us (are those who are) other than that, we are sects following different traditions
And we know that we can neither defeat Allah in the earth nor can we defeat Him by flight
And when we heard the guidance, we believed in it, so whoever believes in his Fosterer, he should neither fear loss nor error
And among us are those who have submitted (as Muslims) and among us are those who are unjust. So those who have submitted (as Muslims) such have taken to the right way
And as for those who are unjust, they are the fuel for hell.”
And if they establish (themselves) on (the right) tradition We would give them to drink abundant water
so that We may test them thereby, and whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Fosterer He will cause him to enter severe punishment
And the mosques are Allah's so do not pray to anyone (else along) with Allah
And when the servant of Allah stood up to pray to Him they almost crowded over him
Say, “I pray only to my Fosterer and I do not associate anyone with Him.”
Say, “I certainly do not control for you anything, wrong or right.”
Say, “None can ever protect me against Allah and I can never find besides Him, (any source of) refuge
(my duty is nothing) but to convey (the communications) from Allah and His messages, and whoever disobeys Allah and His messenger, then for such, there is certainly the fire , of hell, in which they will stay forever.” which they will stay forever.”
(The infidels will not believe) till (the time) when they see that which they are promised, then they will know who is weaker in helpers and lesser in number
Say, “I do not know whether that which you are promised is nearer or whether my Fosterer has made its (time of happening) far off.”
Knower of the unseen, but He does not reveal His unseen to anyone
except to a messenger whom He chooses, but He makes one who is watchful, to move before him and behind him
that He may know (mark out) that they have indeed conveyed the messages of their Fosterer. And He encompasses all that is with them and He computes the number of everything
O you who are wrapped up in garments
Rise (to pray in) the night except a little
half of it or a little less than that
or increase it and recite the Quran gradually (giving) intervals
We will put on you (the responsibility of delivering) a weighty statement
The rising at night (for righteous work) certainly gives rise to more strength of co-ordination and firmly established speech (because)
during the day you certainly have prolonged occupation
And remember the name of your Fosterer and devote yourself to Him (with exclusive) devotion
Fosterer of the east and the west, there is no god except Him, so take Him as a Trustee
And be patient on what they say and keep away from them in a good (manner of) keeping away
And leave Me and the deniers, the possessors of favours (from Me) and give them a little time
Certainly, with Us are heavy fetters and hell fire
and a food that chokes and a painful punishment
The day the earth will quake and the mountains (too), and the mountains will become a heap of running sand
We have sent to you a messenger, a witness over you, as We had sent a messenger to Firawn
But Firawn disobeyed the messenger, so We seized him with a severe seizure
If you reject, then how will you guard (yourselves) on the day which will make children grey headed
(and) on which (day) the sky will be cleft asunder ? His promise is to be fulfilled
This is certainly a reminder, so whoever wills, let him take a way towards his Fosterer
Your Fosterer certainly knows that you stand (for worship, salat) nearly two thirds of the night and (sometimes) half of it or one third of it along with a party of those with you, and Allah measures out the night and the day, He knows that you are not able to keep count of the (length of night), so He has turned to you (mercifully). Therefore recite as much of the Quran as may be easy for you. He knows that there will be (some who are) sick among you and others traveling in the earth seeking from Allah’s grace and (still) others fighting in the way of Allah. So recite as much of the (Quran) as may be easy (for you) and establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat) and loan to Allah a good loan. And whatever of good you send in advance for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, (and) it will be better and greater in reward (compared to your good deeds). And seek protective forgiveness from Allah, Allah is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful
O you (who are) covered with cloth
Rise, then warn
and then (declare) the greatness of your Fosterer
and then keep your clothes clean
and then forsake uncleanliness
and do not bestow favour (with the intention of) receiving more (in return)
and then be patient for (the sake of) your Fosterer
So (the day) when the trumpet will be sounded
then that day will be the day of difficulty
it will not be easy for the infidels
Leave Me and him whom I created alone
and assigned to him extensive wealth
and sons who are witnessed (being always present before him)
and made habitable for him (his) habitation
(Even) then he hopes that I would give him more
By no means ! he offers opposition to Our signs
I will involve him in a severe punishment
He reflected and made a programme
So be he killed, how he made a programme
again be he killed, how he made a programme
Then he looked
then he frowned and made a face
then he turned away considering himself great
then said, “This is nothing but magic derived from the ancient
this is nothing but the statement of man.”
I will make him enter hell
And what will make you realize what hell is
It does not let (anything) to remain nor does it spare
It will burn and darken the skin (of man)
Over it are nineteen
And We have not appointed the guardians of hell, other than the angels, and We have not fixed their number but for the affliction of those who do not believe. So that those who are given the book may be certain and those who believe may increase in belief and those who were given the book and the believers may not be doubtful. And those in whose hearts is a disease and the infidels may say, “What does Allah intend by this similitude?” Thus Allah leaves to stray whom He wills and He guides whom He wills and no one knows the forces of your Fosterer except He Himself and this is nothing but a reminder to man
No, by the moon
and the night when it retreats
and the day when it shines
it (the news of hell) is certainly a great
warning to man
to him among you who wills to advance or remain behind
Every soul is held in pledge (security) for that which it earned
except the companions of the right hand
in gardens, asking each other
about the criminals
“What has brought you into the hell?”
They will say, “We were not of those who offered worship (salat)
and we did not feed the poor
and we used to involve ourselves in idle talk with those involved in idle talk
and we used to deny the day of judgment
till (death) which is certain came to us.”
So the mediation of mediators will not be of benefit to them
So what is (wrong) with them that they turn away from the reminder
as if they are frightened asses
fleeing from a lion
No, every man from among them desires that he should be given open pages
No, they do not fear the hereafter
No, it is certainly a reminder
so whoever wills may mind it
and they do not mind unless Allah wills, He is worthy to be feared and capable to be Protectively Forgiving
No, I do swear by the day of resurrection
no,! and I do swear by the self-accusing soul (the conscience)
Does man think that We will not gather his bones
Why not! We are able to put in order his very finger tips
No, man intends to exceed the limits (set) before him
He asks, “When is the day of resurrection?”
(It will be) then, when the sight will be dazzled
and the moon will sink
when the sun and the moon will be brought together
Man will say on that day, “Where is the place to flee?”
By no means ! (there is) no place of refuge
The only place to stay on that day, will be near your Fosterer
Man will be informed on that day about what he had sent before him (preferred) and what he had put (behind his) back (i.e. he will be informed of his priorities)
No, man will be a witness against his own soul
though he will put forward his excuses
(While reciting the Quran) do not move your tongue (fast) with it (so as to) make haste with it
(The responsibility of) collecting it and reciting it, is certainly on Us
Therefore when We recite it, then follow its recitation
Then (the responsibility of) its explanation (too), is certainly on Us
No, but you love that which hastens away (life of this world)
and neglect the hereafter
Faces on that day will be radiant (with happiness)
looking towards their Fosterer
and (other) faces on that day will be gloomy
expecting that (some) disaster is to fall on them
No, when the (soul) reaches the throat
and it is said, “Who could be a magician (or a physician to save his life)?”
And he expects that it is (the time of) parting
and one ankle is joined with (the other) ankle
towards your Fosterer, on that day, will be the driving
So he neither accepted the truth nor worshipped (offered salat)
but denied and turned back
Then he went to his people, walking boastfully
Sorrow upon sorrow for you
again sorrow upon sorrow for you
Does man think that he (was created) to be left off without (fulfilling) any purpose
Was he not a sperm in the seminal fluid which is emitted
Then it became something that clings and hangs like a leech, so He proportioned it then set it in equilibrium
Then He made from it two kinds, the male and the female
Is He not able to give life to the dead
There has passed on man a period of time when he was not a thing (worth) a discussion
We certainly created man from a sperm mingled (with egg) to test him, therefore We made him hearing, seeing
We have shown him the way (now it is left to him) whether he becomes one who gratefully accepts or becomes one who ungratefully rejects (it)
We have prepared for the infidels, chains and yokes and a blazing fire
And the righteous will certainly drink from a cup, the admixture of which will be kafur
a spring from which the servants of Allah will drink, they will make it to gush forth, a gushing forth
They fulfil their vows and fear a day, the evil of which will spread far and wide
And they feed for His love, the poor and the orphan and the prisoner, with food
(saying), “We feed you only (to seek the) Attention of Allah, we do not intend (to receive) any reward from you nor (even your) thanks
We certainly fear from our Fosterer, a distressful day of frowning.”
So Allah will save them from the evil of that day and He will make them to meet radiant happiness and joy
and reward them with a garden and (garments of) silk, because they were patient
reclining therein on couches, they will neither see the sun nor (experience) intense cold therein
And the shades of the (garden) will be near above them and the clusters of it will be made to hang low (being in their reach)
And goblets of silver and cups of (transparent) glass will be made to go round about them, (they will be)
(transparent as) glass (but made) of silver*, which are measured according to a measure. * Probably photo chromatic glasses containing silver halides which darken in sunlight and bleach in dark
And they will be made to drink therein, a cup, the admixture of which will be Zanjabil
a spring therein, which is named Salsabil
Youths always staying (in attendance) will go round them. When you see them, you will think them to be scattered pearls
And when (ever) you see, there you will see (only) excellence and a great kingdom
Upon them will be garments of fine green silk and thick silk interwoven with gold, and they will be adorned with brackets of silver and their Fosterer will make them drink a clean drink
This is certainly a reward for you, and your striving will be acknowledged
We have sent down the Quran on you, sending (it) down gradually
So wait patiently for the command of your Fosterer, and do not obey any sinner or any infidel among them
And remember the name of your Fosterer, morning and evening
and during (part) of the night, prostrate before Him, and glorify Him (during) a long (portion of the) night
These certainly love that which hastens away (life of this world) and put away behind them (the thought of) a weighty day
We have created them and We have strengthened their frame and when We will We can bring in their place (others) like them, changing (completely)
This is certainly a reminder, so whoever wills, He may take a way towards his Fosterer
and you do not will unless Allah wills, Allah is certainly Knowing, Wise
He makes to enter His mercy whom He wills; and the unjust, He has prepared for them a painful punishment
By those sent one after another
then the violent winds, blowing violently
and those that scatter, scattering
then those that distinguish, distinguishing (right from wrong)
then those that bring down the reminder
excusing or warning
That which you are promised will certainly befall
So when the stars are made to disappear
and when the sky is cleft asunder
and when the mountains are uprooted as dust
and when the messengers are brought (at their) appointed time
For which day (is this) timed
For the day of decision
And what will make you realize, what the day of decision is
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
Did We not destroy the ancients
Then We made the others to follow them
Thus do We deal with the criminals
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
Did We not create you from a fluid (which is) weakened after vigor
Then We made it to stay in a place
till (the fulfilment of) the known programme
thus We programmed, for We are Excellent Programmers
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
Did We not make the earth, one that draws together to itself
the living and the dead (due to the force of its gravity)
And We made therein lofty ranges of mountains and gave you to drink sweet water
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
(It will be said to them), “Proceed towards that which you used to deny
Proceed towards the covering having three branches
neither (giving) cool shade nor making one free from the flame
it certainly throws sparks like palaces
as if they were yellow camels.”
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
This is the day (on which) they will not speak
And permission will not be given to them that they may put forth excuses
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
This is the day of decision, We have gathered you and the ancients
So if there is any plot you have, then do plot against Me
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
Those who had guarded (against evil) will be in shades and springs
and fruits which they desire
(It will be said), “Eat and drink pleasantly because of that, which you used to do.”
Thus do We reward the doers of good
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
Eat and enjoy yourselves for a while, you are certainly criminals
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
And when it is said to them to bow down, they do not bow down
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
Then in which statement after this, will they believe
About what do they ask one another
About the great news
concerning which they disagree
No, they will come to know
Again, no, they will come to know
Did We not make the earth habitable
and the mountains pegs
And We created you in pairs
And We made your sleep for rest
And We made the night a covering
And We made the day (for earning) livelihood
And We built above you seven strong ones
And We made (the sun) a burning lamp
And We sent down from the rain-clouds, torrential rain
that We may bring forth through it grain and vegetation
and dense gardens
The day of decision is certainly fixed
The day it will be blown into the trumpet (or structure of the universe) you will come forth in groups
And the sky will be opened so that it will become gates
and the mountains will be moved away, so that they will become like flowing sand
Hell certainly lies in wait
a home for the rebellious
They will stay in it for ages
They will taste therein neither coolness nor drink
except boiling water and pus*, * Dirty liquid that oozes out of wounds
a reward proportional (to their sins)
They certainly did not hope that they would have to account for (their evil deeds)
and they denied Our signs with a denial
and We have computed everything in a record
So taste (the punishment), and We will not increase for you anything except punishment
For those who guard (against evil there) is certainly an achievement
Gardens and vineyards
and young women of equal age
and a full cup
They will hear therein neither useless talk nor falsehood
Reward from your Fosterer, a gift (for the) account (of good deeds)
The Fosterer of the skies and the earth and that which is between them, the Beneficent, they will not be able to address Him
The day the spirit (Jibreel) and the angels stand in ranks, they will not speak, except the one who is permitted by the Beneficent and he speaks aright
That's a real day (not fictitious), so whoever wills let him seek a home near his Fosterer
We warn you of a punishment that is near, the day man will see that which his hands had sent forth and the infidel will say, “I wish I were dust.”
By those who pull out getting drowned (going deep to the last limit)
and those who untie, releasing
and those who are busy moving swiftly
then those who are ahead, being ahead
then those who manage the affair
On the day the quaking one (the earth) will quake
and the succeeding one will follow it
on that day hearts will palpitate
their looks will be cast down
They say, “Shall we be restored to our first state
even when we have become rotten bones?”
They say, “Then this would be a return of loss.”
So it will only be a single shout
when they will be awake
Has the story of Musa come to you
When his Fosterer called him in the holy valley of Tuwa (saying)
Go to Firawn, he has certainly rebelled
then say to him, “ Have you the inclination to purify yourself
and that I should guide you to your Fosterer, so that you fear (Him)?”
Then he showed him the great sign
but he denied and disobeyed
then he turned away in haste
then he gathered to proclaim
then said, “I am your top most fosterer.”
So Allah caught him for punishment (both in) the later and the former (life)
There is certainly a lesson in that for one who fears
Are you the stronger in creation or the sky which He built
He raised its height and then set it in equilibrium
And He darkened its night and brought out its day light
And He stretched out the earth (drifting the continents apart), after that
brought out from the (earth) its water and its pasture
and He firmly anchored the mountains
A provision for you and for your cattle
So when the great predominating calamity comes
the day man will recollect what he earnestly strove after
And the hell will be made manifest for him who sees
So as for him who rebelled
and preferred the life of this world
then hell will certainly be his home
And as for him who feared to stand before his Fosterer and restrained himself from evil desire
then the garden will certainly be his home
They ask you about the hour of doom, “When will be its anchorage (time of happening) ?”
In what way are you to discuss it
To your Fosterer (belongs the knowledge of) the ultimate time of its happening
You are a warner only for him who fears it
The day they see it, for them it will be as if they had not stayed (in their graves or this world) except for an evening or a morning of it
He (Muhammed) frowned and turned his back
that the blind man came to him
And what will make you realize that he might have purified himself
or be reminded, so that (your) reminding might have profited him
As for him who is carefree (wealthy)
to him then, you pay attention
And if he does not purify himself, the responsibility is not on you
And as for him who comes to you striving hard
and he fears
from him you are distracted
No, it is certainly a reminder
so whoever wills let him remember it
(It is) in pages honoured
elevated, clean
in the hands of writers
honoured, virtuous
Perished be man, how ungrateful he is
From what thing did He create him
He created him from a sperm, then programmed him (to follow a certain path)
then, He eased that path for him
Then He causes him to die then buries him
Then, when He wills, He will raise him
No, he has not done that which He commanded him to do
So let man look at his food
How We pour water in the form of rain
then We split the earth, (with) a splitting
then We cause to grow therein, grain
and grapes and green fodder
and olive trees and date palms
and dense gardens
and fruits and herbage
A provision for you and for your cattle
Then when the deafening sound comes
(it will be) a day when man will run away from his brother
and his mother and his father
and his wife and his sons
on that day, for everyone of them there will be enough concern to keep him unconcerned with others
(Some) faces on that day will be bright
laughing, rejoicing at the good news
(while other) faces on that day will have dust over them
being covered with darkness
Those are the infidels, the transgressors
When the sun is made to wind up
and when the stars become hazy
and when the mountains are moved away
and when camels with ten months' pregnancy are left off
and when wild animals are brought together
and when the oceans are flooded
and when the souls are paired (probably with their respective bodies)
and when the female child buried alive is asked
for what sin she was killed
and when the pages are spread
and when the sky has its covering removed
and when the hell is kindled
and when the garden is brought near
(every) soul (everyone) will know what (deeds) it has brought for presentation
So I do swear by those that withdraw
those that move swiftly, hiding
and the night when it comes (and goes)
and the morning when it breathes (and makes us conscious)
it is certainly the word of an honoured messenger (Jibreel)
possessor of power, established in the presence (of Allah) to Whom belongs the throne
one to be obeyed, and with it trustworthy
And your companion (Muhammed) is not possessed by jinn
And he (Muhammed) saw him (Jibreel) on the clear horizon
And he is not a miser concealing (information) of the unseen
And it is not the word of the cursed devil
So in' which direction are you all going
The (Quran) is nothing but a reminder to the worlds
for him among you who wills to be upright
And you do not will unless Allah, the Fosterer of the worlds, wills
When the sky is cleft asunder
and when the planets are made to fall
and when the oceans are made to overflow
and when the graves are overturned
(every) soul will know what it had advanced (preferred) and what it had kept behind (not preferred)
O man ! what has deceived you concerning your Honoured Fosterer
Who created you, then set the equilibrium in you so as to balance you
In whatever form He willed, He constituted you
No, but you deny the (day of) judgment
And certainly over you are custodians
honoured recorders
they know what you do
The righteous will certainly be in bliss
And the transgressors will certainly be in hell
They will enter it on the day of judgment
and they will not be absent from it
And what will make you realize what the day of judgment is
Again, what will make you realize what the day of judgment is
The day on which no soul (person) will have any power on another soul (person), and the command on that day will be (totally) Allah’s
Sorrowful is the state of those who measure and weigh less than what is due
those who, when they take by measure from other people, they take in full
but when they measure or weigh for others, they make it less than what is due
Do they not expect that they will be raised (after their death)
for a great day
the day mankind will stand before the Fosterer of the worlds
No, certainly the record of (deeds) of the transgressors will be in Sijjin
And what will make you realize what Sijjin is
(It is a) written record
Sorrowful will be the state on that day, of the deniers
who deny the day of judgment
And no one denies it except every exceeder of limits, a sinner
When Our signs are read to him, he says, “Ancient stories.”
No, but that which they have earned is rust on their hearts
No, on that day they will certainly be curtained from their Fosterer
then they will certainly enter the hell
then it will be said, “This is that which you made a denial of.”
No, certainly the record of (deeds of) the righteous will be in Illiyin
and what will make you realize what Illiyun is
(It is a) written record
Those who are brought near will witness it
The righteous will certainly be in bliss
They will be seeing (reclining) on couches
You will recognize in their faces, radiance of bliss
They will be given to drink from a pure drink, sealed
The seal of which is of musk. So let those who wish to put in conscious effort, put in a conscious effort for that
And it is admixed with Tasniim
a spring from which those who are brought near will drink
The criminals certainly used to laugh at those who believed
and when they passed by them they used to wink at one another
And when they returned to their class of people, they returned joyful in false pride
And when they saw them they said, “These are certainly the persons who are astray,”
though they were not sent as custodians over them
So this day, those who had believed will laugh at the infidels
They will be seeing (reclining) on couches
Will not the infidels be rewarded according to what they used to do
When the sky is split asunder
and responds to its Fosterer, a duty incumbent on it
And when the earth is stretched out
and casts forth that which is in it and becomes empty
and responds to its Fosterer, a duty incumbent on it
O man! you are certainly labouring towards your Fosterer, with a labour, so you will meet Him
So as for him who is given his record (of deeds) in his right hand
he will be called to account, with an easy accountability
and he will return happily to his class of people
And as for him who is given his record (of deeds) behind his back
he will call for (i.e. invoke) destruction (upon himself)
and he will enter the (hot) blaze
He was certainly happy in his class of people (in the worldly life)
He certainly thought that he would never return
Why not, his Fosterer was certainly seeing him
So I do swear by the redness of the sunset
and the night and that which it gathers
and the moon when it is full
You will definitely be carried from stage to stage
So what is wrong with them that they do not believe
And when the Quran is, recited to them, they do not prostrate
No, those who do not believe, deny
And Allah knows best what they hide
So give them the news of the painful punishment
except those who believe and do righteous works, for them there is an unfailing reward
By the sky containing galaxies of stars
and the promised day
and the witness and the witnessed
Be killed owners of the pit
(of) the fire containing fuel
when they sat around it
And they were (themselves) witnesses over that which they did with the believers
And they did not avenge them except (for the fact) that they believed in Allah, the Mighty, the Praised
Whose is the kingdom of the skies and the earth, and Allah is a Witness over everything
Those who persecute the believing men and the believing women then do not repent, then certainly for them is the punishment of hell and for them is the punishment of burning
Those who believe and do righteous works, certainly, for them are the gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the great achievement
The grip of your Fosterer is certainly strong
It is certainly He Who causes to begin (originates) and causes to repeat (reproduces)
And He is Protectively Forgiving, the Loving
Possessor of the glorious throne
Doer of what He intends
Has there come to you the story of the armies of
Firawn and Samood
No, those who do not believe are in falsehood
and Allah encompasses them from every side (without their notice)
No, it is a glorious Quran
in a guarded tablet
By the sky and the Taariq
And what will make you realize what Taariq is
(It is) the piercing star
There is not a single soul which does not have a custodian over it
So let man see from what he was created
He was created from gushing water (fluid)
that comes out from in between the loins and the ribs
He is certainly able to return him, (and make him face)
the day, (when) secrets will be examined
then there will neither be strength nor a helper for him
By the sky that returns (the water in the form of rain)
and the earth that splits (due to vegetation)
this (Quran) is certainly a decisive statement
and it is not (something to be taken as) a joke
They certainly plot a plot
and I (too) plot a plot
So give time to the infidels, give them time for a while
Glorify the name of your Fosterer, the Most High
Who created then set the equilibrium
and Who programmed then guided (to the programme)
And Who brought forth the pasture
then made it dust coloured rubbish
We will make you recite, so that you will not forget
except that which Allah wills, He certainly knows the manifest and (also) that which is hidden
And We will make your (way) easy for the easy (way)
So remind, if reminding is profitable
he who fears will be reminded
and he who is unfortunate will turn away from it
he who will enter the great fire
then he will neither die therein nor live
He succeeds who purifies himself
and remembers the name of his Fosterer, then worships (offers salat)
No, you prefer the life of this world
while the hereafter is better and that which remains
This is certainly there in the earlier books (too)
books of lbrahim and Musa
Have the details of the happenings on the (day of the final) covering come to you
Faces on that day will be downcast
labouring, weary
entering very hot fire
being made to drink from boiling spring
There will be no food for them except that from the thorn tree
It will neither be nourishable by them nor will it make them free from hunger
(Other) faces that day will be happy
pleased on account of the effort they had put in earlier
(They will be) in a high garden
therein you will not hear useless talk
therein is a flowing spring
therein are raised couches
and drinking cups placed ready (for use)
and cushions set in rows
and carpets spread
So do they not see towards the camel how it is created
and towards the sky how it is raised
and towards the mountains how they are rooted
and towards the earth how it is spread
So remind, you are only to remind
You are not in authority over them
But one who turns away and does not believe
so he will be punished by Allah with a great punishment
Their return is certainly towards Us
then certainly, it is on Us to take their account
By the dawn
and the ten nights
and the even and the odd
and the night when it travels
For one who has sense, these (items) are surely worth being sworn by
Did you not see how your Fosterer dealt with Aad
people of Iram, possessors of (lofty buildings supported by) pillars
the like of which was not created in (other) cities
and Samood who cut the rocks in the valley
and Firawn, possessor of pegs
who rebelled in the cities
Thus they increased corruption in them
So your Fosterer poured on them a portion of the punishment
Your Fosterer is certainly watchfully waiting
So as for man, whenever his Fosterer tries him by honouring him and favouring him, then he says, “My Fosterer has honoured me.”
And as for (the situation) when He tries him by straitening on him his provision, he says, “My Fosterer has disgraced me.”
No, but the orphan is not honoured by you
and you do not urge one another on the feeding of the poor
and you eat off the inheritance, eating it greedily
and you love wealth with intense love
No, when the earth is crushed to level it in a level
and your Fosterer comes with the angels in rank after rank
so on that day, hell will be brought near, (and) on that day man will be mindful. But his being mindful (on that day) will be of no use to him
He will say, "I wish I had sent (good deeds) before, for my life (after death)
So on that day, no one’s punishment will be like His punishment
and no one's binding will be like His binding
O you peaceful soul
Return to your Fosterer pleased and pleasing (Him)
so enter among My servants
and enter My garden
No, I do swear by this city (Mecca)
and you are a dweller of this city
and by the begetter (father) and that which he begot (son)
We have indeed created man in hardship
Does he think that no one will ever have power over him
He says, “I have destroyed plenty of wealth.”
Does he think that no one sees him
Did We not make for him two eyes
and a tongue and two lips
and show him the two high ways (of good and evil)
But he did not attempt the uphill (road)
And what will make you realize what the uphill (road) is
Freeing a slave
or feeding during a period of hunger
an orphan having relationship
or the dusty poor
then to be among those who believe and recommend to each other patience and recommend to each other compassion
Those are the companions of the right hand (side)
And those who do not believe in Our signs, they are the companions of the left hand (side)
Fire will be closed over them (enveloping them from all sides)
By the sun and its light
and the moon when it reflects it
and the day when it unveils it
and the night when it covers it
and the sky and Him Who built it
and the earth and Him Who spread it
and the soul and Him Who balanced it
then inspired in it, its transgressions and its guarding (against evils)
He indeed succeeds who purifies it
and he indeed fails who buries it
Samood denied (the truth) due to their rebellion
when the most wretched of them broke forth
The messenger of Allah told them, “It is the she-camel of Allah, so let her drink.”
But they denied him and slaughtered her so their Fosterer destroyed them due to their sin and thus balanced it (the destruction was equal to their crime)
And He does not fear its consequence
By the night when it covers (the sun)
and the day when it unveils (the sun)
and Him Who created the male and the female
Your striving is certainly for diverse ends
So as for him who gave and guarded (against evil)
and accepted that which was best
We will facilitate him for ease
And as for him who was niggardly and considered himself independent
and denied that which was best
We will facilitate him for difficulty
And his wealth will not keep him safe from difficulty when he perishes
It is certainly on Us to guide
And certainly, Ours is the latter (future) and the former (past)
So I warn you of the blazing fire
None will enter it except the wretched
who denied and turned away
And one who guards (against evil) will be saved from it
he who gives his wealth for his self purification
and he does not bestow favour on anyone, from that which is with him, (with the intention of) being rewarded (back)
but he seeks the Attention of his Fosterer, the High
And he will surely be pleased
By the brightness of the day
and the night when it darkens
Your Fosterer has neither forsaken you nor does he hate you
And surely the latter period (future) will be better for you than the former (past)
And surely you will be given (so much) by your Fosterer that you will be pleased
Did He not find you an orphan, then give you shelter
and find you wandering then guide you
and find you poor then make you free of want
So as for the orphan do not oppress (him)
and as for the beggar do not drive him away
and as for the favour of your Fosterer, do proclaim
Did We not expand for you your bosom
and relieve you of your burden
which weighed down your back
and exalted for you your mention
So certainly with difficulty is ease
Certainly with difficulty is ease
So when you are free, then strive
and turn your attention towards your Fosterer
By the fig (or the place Tiin where Nuh’s ship embarked), and the olive (or Zaita in Jerusalam, were Isa-ibni-Maryam received and preached the message of Allah)
and Mount Sinai (where Musa received the message of Allah)
and this city of security (Mecca, where our prophet Muhammed initially received and preached the message of Allah, all these are witnesses that)
We had indeed created man in the best form
then We brought him back as the lowest of those who are low
except those who believed and did righteous works, then for them there is an unfailing reward
Then after this what makes you deny the judgment
Is not Allah the Best Judge, of all the judges
Recite in the name of your Fosterer Who created
He created man from something that clings and hangs (like a leech)
Recite, and your Fosterer is the Most Honourable
Who taught with the pen
He taught man that which he did not know
No, man certainly rebels
because he sees himself independent
Certainly, towards your Fosterer is the return
Have you seen him who forbids
when a servant of Allah worships
Have you seen, if he is on guidance
or enjoins guarding (against evil)
Have you seen, if he denies and turns (his back)
did he not know that Allah certainly sees
No, if he does not stop, We will drag him, seizing him by his forelock
the denying, sinful forelock
So let him call his council
We will call the soldiers (guards of hell)
No, do not obey him but prostrate and draw near (to Allah)
We certainly sent it** down during the night of Al Qadr. ** The Quran
And what will make you realize what the night of Al Qadr is
The night of Al Qadr is better than a thousand months
The angels and the spirit come down during this night by the permission of their Fosterer with (a programme for) every affair
Peace! it is till the appearance of dawn
Those who do not believe from among the owners of the book and the polytheists would not have left off (falsehood) till the clear proof had come to them (in the form of)
a messenger from Allah, reading clean pages
containing established ordinances
And those who were given the book did not become divided except after the clear proof came to them
And they were not ordered anything except that they should serve Allah, keeping religion exclusively for Him, being those who stand firm on that which is right, and (that they should) establish worship (salat) and give charity (zakat), and that is the established religion
Those who do not believe from among the owners of the book and the polytheists will certainly be in the fire of hell, staying therein, those are the persons who are the worst of creatures
Those who believe and do righteous works those certainly are the persons who are the best of creatures
Their reward is with their Fosterer: Gardens of everlasting bliss, underneath which rivers flow, they will stay therein for ever, Allah pleased with them and they pleased with Him. That is for him who fears his Fosterer
When the earth is quaked with its quaking
and the earth brings out its weighty material
and man will say, “What ails her ?”
She will be made to tell her news on that day
because your Fosterer (would have) communicated to her
On that day human beings will be brought forth in diverse groups, to be shown their deeds
So whoever does good equivalent in weight, even to a small particle, will see it
And whoever does evil equivalent in weight, even to a small particle, will see it
By those that move fast breathing heavily
then those that strike fire striking
then those that raid at dawn
then thereby raise dust
then penetrate into the midst of an assembly
Man is certainly ungrateful to his Fosterer
and he himself is a witness over that
And he certainly has intense love for good (worldly wealth)
Then does he not know, that when that which is in the graves is exposed
and that which is in the bosoms is made to appear (i.e. secrets are revealed)
certainly on that day, their Fosterer is fully informed about them
The calamity
What is the calamity
And what will make you realize what the calamity is? (It will befall on)
the day when mankind will be like scattered moths
and the mountains will be like loosened wool
Then as for him whose weights (of good deeds) are heavy
then he will lead a life of pleasure
And as for him whose weights (of good deeds) are light
then his home* will be in a deep pit (of hell). * Destination
And what will make you realize what the (deep pit of hell) is
(It is a) very hot fire
Rivalry in worldly increase distracts you (from the remembrance of Allah)
till you come to the graves
No, you will know
Again, no, you will know
No, if you know (having) the knowledge that is certain
you will definitely see hell fire
Then you will definitely see it with the eye of certainty
Then on that day you will definitely be questioned about the comforts
By the time (i.e. historic time is witness that)
Man is certainly at a loss
except those who believe and do righteous works and recommend to one another, the truth, and recommend to one another, patience
Sorrowful is the state of every slanderer, defamer
who accumulates wealth and keeps on counting it
He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal
No, he will definitely be flung into the crushing one
And what will make you realize what the crushing one is
(It is the) fire of Allah, kindled
which is made to rise over the hearts
it will certainly be closed on them
in columns that are stretched
Did you not consider, how your Fosterer dealt with the owners of the elephant
Did He not make their plot useless
and send on them flocks of flying creatures
who pelted them with stones of baked clay
so that He made them like eaten up straw (husk)
For the taming of Quraysh
their taming in equipping caravans (for traveling) in winter and summer
so let them serve the Fosterer of this house (Kaaba)
Who has fed them in hunger and given them security from fear
Did you see him who belies religion
Then he is the one who pushes away the orphan
and does not urge on the feeding of the poor
So sorrowful is the state of the worshippers
who are heedless of their worship (salat)
(in the sense that they are) those who make a show (of their worship)
and refuse small kindness
We certainly gave you abundance
so worship your Fosterer and sacrifice
The one who hates you, he is certainly without posterity
Say, “O Infidels
I do not serve (worship) that which you serve (worship)
And you are not servers of that which I serve
And I am not a server of that which you serve
And you are not servers of that which I serve
For you your religion (or judgment) and for me my religion (or judgment).”
When Allah's help and the victory comes
and you see people enter the religion of Allah in troops
then glorify your Fosterer by praising Him and seek His protective forgiveness. He is certainly the Accepter of repentance
May the hands of Abu Lahab perish. And may he perish
His wealth and that which he earned will not save him
He will enter flaming fire
and his wife (too who is a) carrier of fire-wood
In her neck (there will be) a rope of palm-fibre
Say, “Allah is One
Allah is He on Whom all depend
He does not beget and He is not begotten
And there is no one equal to Him.”
Say, “I seek the protection of the Fosterer of the day break
from the evil of that which He has created
and from the evil of the darkness (of night) when it overspreads
and from the evil of women blowing in the knots (practicing witchcraft)
and from the evil of the envier when he envies.”
Say, “I seek the protection of the Fosterer of mankind
the King of mankind
the God of mankind
from the evil of the whisperings of (the devil), he who (whispers and then) withdraws
who whispers into the bosoms (hearts or minds) of mankind
from among the jinn and mankind.”
