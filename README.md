### Displaying Text:
- Use [Arabic Fonts](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fawazahmed0/quran-api@1/fonts.json) to display the Quran text. In case the font shows few [tofu characters](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/62524/what-do-you-call-the-phenomenon-where-a-rectangle-is-shown-because-a-font-lack), then use fonts with [-full suffix](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/quran-api/blob/1468ba338f744c8eec4208fe36808206febe4add/fonts.json#L195) which has complete Arabic Unicode Support.<br>
Refer [font-full](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/quran-api/blob/1/fontfull.md) to know more.

- Use [Google Noto Fonts](https://www.google.com/get/noto/) to display the translation. By default OS doesn't have font installed for every language. So you will have to use fonts for few languages such as [Burmese](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#serif-mymr) etc, to show properly. Otherwise you will end up with [tofu characters](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/62524/what-do-you-call-the-phenomenon-where-a-rectangle-is-shown-because-a-font-lack).

### Languages Available:
By the mercy of God, there are [98 different language](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/quran-api/blob/1/Translations.md) translations available and a collection of  [440+ translations](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/quran-api/blob/1/editions.json).
Few of the translations were [OCRed](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/quran-api/blob/1/Translations.md#ocred) and may contain mistakes. Please do [report the mistakes](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/quran-api/issues/new).

### Download: [Here](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/quran-api/blob/1/download.md)

### Authenticity:
I have taken care to not include any controversial authors, for example: 'Rashad Khalifa' , because there are chances that the translation may contain opinions of the author and not the meaning of the verse.
The Ahmaddiya community has done great work in translating the quran to many different languages of the world. May God reward them with guidance.
But I cannot take those translations also because the verses such as those talking about Jesus ([4:157](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/fawazahmed0/quran-api@1/editions/eng-ummmuhammad/4/157.json "4:157")) usually have opinions of the author of what actually happened to Jesus etc.

I might have mistakenly added a few of them. In case you find any translation whose authenticity could be questioned, please let me know at [here](https://github.com/fawazahmed0/quran-api/issues/new "here") .After verifying the claims, I remove the translation

### Donation:
Even though I worked very hard on this project, I will not ask donation for myself. I will take the reward from God in this world and the next, may God accept my work.

But what I ask you is to donate directly to the authors and Islamic/dawah publishers who have worked so hard to make these translations, so that the word of God could spread around the world and people will know about the one who created them.
