And Allah is All-Aware of what you do"},{"chapter":3,"verse":154,"text":"Then after distress, He sent down serenity in the form of drowsiness overcoming some of you, while others were disturbed by evil thoughts about Allah—the thoughts of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. They ask, “Do we have a say in the matter?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “All matters are destined by Allah.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, Allah tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts. And Allah knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart"},{"chapter":3,"verse":155,"text":"Indeed, those ˹believers˺ who fled on the day when the two armies met were made to slip by Satan because of their misdeeds.

Do not be like the unfaithful who say about their brothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” Allah makes such thinking a cause of agony in their hearts. It is Allah who gives life and causes death. And Allah is All-Seeing of what you do"},{"chapter":3,"verse":157,"text":"Should you be martyred or die in the cause of Allah, then His forgiveness and mercy are far better than whatever ˹wealth˺ those ˹who stay behind˺ accumulate"},{"chapter":3,"verse":158,"text":"Whether you die or are martyred—all of you will be gathered before Allah"},{"chapter":3,"verse":159,"text":"It is out of Allah’s mercy that you ˹O Prophet˺ have been lenient with them.

Once you make a decision, put your trust in Allah. Surely Allah loves those who trust in Him"},{"chapter":3,"verse":160,"text":"If Allah helps you, none can defeat you. But if He denies you help, then who else can help you? So in Allah let the believers put their trust"},{"chapter":3,"verse":161,"text":"It is not appropriate for a prophet to illegally withhold spoils of war.
