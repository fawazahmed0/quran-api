{"chapter":65,"verse":11,"text":"˹and sent˺ a messenger reciting to you Allah’s revelations, making things clear so that He may bring those who believe and do good out of darkness and into light. And whoever believes in Allah and does good will be admitted by Him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to stay there for ever and ever. Allah will have indeed granted them an excellent provision"}
