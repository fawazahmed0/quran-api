    "text": "God received a pledge from the Children of Israel, and We raised among them twelve chiefs. God said, 'I am with you; if you perform the prayer, and pay the alms, and believe in My messengers and support them, and lend God a loan of righteousness; I will remit your sins, and admit you into Gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever among you disbelieves afterwards has strayed from the right way"
