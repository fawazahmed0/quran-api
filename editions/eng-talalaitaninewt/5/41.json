    "text": "O Messenger! Do not let those who are quick to disbelief grieve you—from among those who say with their mouths, 'We believe,' but their hearts do not believe; and from among the Jews—listeners to lies, listeners to other people who did not come to you. They distort words from their places, and they say, 'If you are given this, accept it; but if you are not given it, beware.' Whomever God has willed to divert, you have nothing for him from God. Those are they whose hearts God does not intend to purify. For them is disgrace in this world, and for them is a great punishment in the Hereafter"
