    "text": "Have you noted those who were prohibited from conspiring secretly, but then reverted to what they were prohibited from? They conspire to commit sin, and aggression, and defiance of the Messenger. And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting that God never greeted you with. And they say within themselves, 'Why does God not punish us for what we say?' Hell is enough for them. They will roast in it. What a miserable destiny"
