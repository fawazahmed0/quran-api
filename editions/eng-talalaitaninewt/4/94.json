    "text": "O you who believe! When you journey in the way of God, investigate, and do not say to him who offers you peace, 'You are not a believer,' aspiring for the goods of this world. With God are abundant riches. You yourselves were like this before, and God bestowed favor on you; so investigate. God is well aware of what you do"
