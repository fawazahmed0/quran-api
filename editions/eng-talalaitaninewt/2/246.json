    "text": "Have you not considered the notables of the Children of Israel after Moses? When they said to a prophet of theirs, 'Appoint a king for us, and we will fight in the cause of God.' He said, 'Is it possible that, if fighting was ordained for you, you would not fight?' They said, 'Why would we not fight in the cause of God, when we were driven out of our homes, along with our children?' But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. But God is aware of the wrongdoers"
