Oblige them not to go out of their apartments, neither let them go out, until the term be expired, unless they be guilty of manifest uncleanness. These are the statutes of God: And whoever transgresseth the statutes of God, assuredly injureth his own soul: Thou knowest not whether God will bring something new to pass, which may reconcile them, after this"
