Whoever drinks from it, he is not of me, and whoever not taste it, indeed he is of me, except him who takes in the hollow of his hand.\" Yet, they all drank from it, except a few of them. So when he had crossed the river and those who believed with him, they said: \"There is no strength (left) for us today against Goliath and his forces.\" But those who knew that they were to meet Allah, said: \"How often a small group overcame a large group by the Grace of Allah? Allah is with the patient ones.”"
