    "text": "I shall turn away from My signs those who, without any right, behaved haughtily in the earth, even if they may, witness each and every, sign, they shall not believe therein. And even if they see the right path, they shall still not follow it; but if they see the path of error. they shall choose it for their path. This is because they rejected Our signs as false and were heedless to them"
