    "text": "Have you not seen those who were forbidden to whisper and yet they engaged in what they had been forbidden? They secretly converse among themselves concerning sin and transgression and disobedience to the Messenger. And when they come to you, they greet you in a manner that Allah does not greet you, and say to themselves: “Why does Allah not chastise us for these utterances of ours?” Hell it is that shall suffice them, and in it will they burn. How woeful is their destination"
