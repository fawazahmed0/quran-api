{"chapter":5,"verse":18,"text":"The Jews and Christians say, “We are Allah’s children and His beloved ones.” Say, “Why then does He punish you for your sins? Rather, you are humans just like anyone else He created. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.” To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and earth and all that is between them, and to Him is the final return.”"}
