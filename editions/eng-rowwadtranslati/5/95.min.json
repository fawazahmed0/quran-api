{"chapter":5,"verse":95,"text":"O you who believe, do not kill game while you are on pilgrimage. Whoever of you kills it deliberately should compensate by offering its equivalent – as judged by two just men among you – to be offered at the Sacred House, or by feeding the needy, or by fasting its equivalent, so that he may taste the consequence of his deed. Allah has pardoned what has passed, but whoever does it again, Allah will subject him to retribution, for Allah is All-Mighty, Capable of Retribution"}
