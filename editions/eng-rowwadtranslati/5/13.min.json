{"chapter":5,"verse":13,"text":"As a result of their breaking of the covenant We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They distort words [of the Scripture] from their context, and forgot parts of what was enjoined upon them. You will not cease to discover betrayal on their part except for a few. So pardon them and overlook, for Allah loves those who do good"}
