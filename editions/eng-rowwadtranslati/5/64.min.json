{"chapter":5,"verse":64,"text":"The Jews say, “Allah’s Hand is restrained.” Their hands have been restrained and they have been cursed for what they say. Rather, His both Hands are wide open, spending as He pleases. What has been sent down to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Every time they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. They strive to spread corruption in the land, and Allah does not like those who spread corruption"}
