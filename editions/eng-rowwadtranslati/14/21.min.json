{"chapter":14,"verse":21,"text":"All will appear before Allah, then those who were weak will say to those who were arrogant, “We were your followers; can you avail us anything against the punishment of Allah?” They will say, “If Allah had guided us, we would have guided you. It is all the same for us whether we cry or suffer patiently, we have no escape.”"}
