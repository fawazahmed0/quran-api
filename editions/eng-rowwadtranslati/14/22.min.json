{"chapter":14,"verse":22,"text":"Satan will say when the matter is finally decided, “Allah gave you a true promise; I also gave you promise, but I betrayed you. I had no authority over you, except that I called you and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves. I cannot rescue you, nor can you rescue me. I deny your previous association of me with Allah. Indeed, for the wrongdoers there will be a painful punishment.”"}
