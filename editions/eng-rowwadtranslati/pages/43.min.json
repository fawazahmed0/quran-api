As for those who disbelieve, their protectors are false gods; they bring them out from the light into the depths of darkness.

When Abraham said, “My Lord is the One Who gives life and causes death.” He said, “I give life and cause death.” Abraham said, “It is Allah Who brings the sun from the east, so bring it from the west.” Thus the disbeliever was dumbfounded, and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people"},{"chapter":2,"verse":259,"text":"Or [have you considered] the one who passed by a town in ruins with its roofs collapsed? He said: “How can Allah revive them after their death?” Then Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then revived him. He said, “How long have you remained [dead]?” He said, “I have remained for a day or part of a day”. He said, “No, but you have remained for a hundred years. Look at your food and your drink; they have not changed. But look at your donkey, so that We make you a sign for people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together then cover them with flesh.” When this was made clear to him, he said: “I know that Allah is Most Capable of all things.”"}]}
