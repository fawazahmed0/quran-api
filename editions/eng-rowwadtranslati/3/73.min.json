{"chapter":3,"verse":73,"text":"And do not believe in anyone except those who follow your religion.” Say, “The guidance is the guidance of Allah.” [They say,] Lest someone may be given similar to what you have been given or argue with you before your Lord. Say, “All bounty is in the Hand of Allah; He grants it to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing, All-Knowing.”"}
