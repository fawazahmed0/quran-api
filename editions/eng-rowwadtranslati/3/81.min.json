{"chapter":3,"verse":81,"text":"And [remember] when Allah took the covenant of the prophets, [saying], “After I have given you the Book and wisdom, if there comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you, then you must believe in him and support him.” Allah said, “Do you affirm this covenant and accept this commitment?” They said, “Yes, we do.” He said, “Then bear witness and I am with you among the witnesses.”"}
