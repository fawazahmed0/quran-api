{"chapter":9,"verse":111,"text":"Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their wealth, and in return they will have Paradise; they fight in the cause of Allah and they kill or are killed. This is a true promise, given by Him in the Torah, the Gospel and the Qur’an. Who is more faithful to his promise than Allah? Rejoice then in the transaction you have made with Him; that is the supreme triumph"}
