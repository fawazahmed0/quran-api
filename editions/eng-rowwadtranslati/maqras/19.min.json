{"maqras":[{"chapter":2,"verse":272,"text":"You are not responsible for their guidance [O Prophet], but Allah guides whom He wills. Whatever wealth you spend in charity, it is for your own good – as long as you do so seeking Allah’s pleasure. And whatever wealth you spend in charity, you will be rewarded in full, and you will not be wronged"},{"chapter":2,"verse":273,"text":"[Charity is] for the poor who are fully occupied in the cause of Allah, unable to move about in the land [for livelihood]; the one who is unaware would think that they are rich because of their self-restraint. You will recognize them by their appearance. They do not ask people importunately. And whatever wealth you give, then Allah is All-Knowing of it"},{"chapter":2,"verse":274,"text":"Those who spend their wealth in charity, day and night, in secret and in public; they will have their reward with their Lord, and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve"},{"chapter":2,"verse":275,"text":"Those who consume usury will not stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except like those being beaten by Satan. That is because they say, “Trade is just like usury.” But Allah has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever desists because of receiving admonition from his Lord may keep his past gains, and his case is left to Allah. But whoever returns to it, they are the people of the Fire; they will abide therein forever"},{"chapter":2,"verse":276,"text":"Allah destroys usury and nourishes charities, and Allah does not like any ungrateful sinner"},{"chapter":2,"verse":277,"text":"Those who believe, do righteous deeds, establish prayer, and give zakah, will have their reward with their Lord; and they will have no fear, nor will they grieve"},{"chapter":2,"verse":278,"text":"O you who believe, fear Allah and give up usury that is still due, if you are truly believers"},{"chapter":2,"verse":279,"text":"But if you do not do it, then beware of a declaration of war from Allah and His Messenger. However, if you repent, you may retain your capital – neither harming nor suffering harm"},{"chapter":2,"verse":280,"text":"If the debtor is in hardship, give him respite until it is easy for him to pay back. But if you waive it as charity, that is better for you, if only you knew"},{"chapter":2,"verse":281,"text":"And fear the Day when you will be brought back to Allah. Then every soul will be rewarded in full for what it has earned, and none will be wronged"},{"chapter":2,"verse":282,"text":"O you who believe, when you contract a debt among yourselves for a fixed period of time, write it down, and let the scribe write it between you with fairness. The scribe whom Allah has taught should not refuse to write, so let him write, and let the debtor dictate, but he should fear Allah his Lord, and not diminish anything out of it. If the debtor is feeble-minded, weak, or unable to dictate, then let his guardian dictate fairly, and bring two witnesses from among your men; if two men are not available, then one man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses – so that if one of them forgets, the other can remind her. The witnesses should not refuse when they are summoned. Do not be reluctant to write down your debts, whether the amount is small or large, for a fixed period of time; that is more equitable in the sight of Allah, and more supportive as evidence, and more likely to prevent doubts among yourselves. However, if you are conducting a transaction on the spot between yourselves, there is no blame upon you not to write it, but take witnesses whenever you trade with one another. Neither a scribe nor a witness should suffer harm, for if you do cause them harm, it is indeed a sin on your part. So fear Allah, for it is Allah Who teaches you, and Allah is All-Knowing of everything"}]}
