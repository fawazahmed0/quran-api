{"chapter":6,"verse":158,"text":"Are they waiting for the coming of the angels, or the coming of your Lord, or the coming of some of your Lord’s signs? On the Day when some of your Lord’s signs come, belief will be of no benefit to those who did not believe before, or those who did not do some good through their faith. Say, “Wait then; we too are waiting.”"}
