{"chapter":6,"verse":145,"text":"Say [O Prophet], “I do not find in what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to eat except carrion, running blood or the swine flesh – which is impure – or a sinful offering in the name of other than Allah. However, if someone is compelled by necessity – neither driven by desire nor transgressing due limit – then your Lord is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”"}
