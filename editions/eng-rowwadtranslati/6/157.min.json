{"chapter":6,"verse":157,"text":"Or you would say, “If only the Scriptures had been sent down to us, we would have been better guided than they.” Now there has come to you a clear proof from your Lord, a guidance and a mercy. Who does greater wrong than he who denies the verses of Allah and turns away from them? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with the worst punishment, for their turning away"}
