{"chapter":6,"verse":93,"text":"Who does greater wrong than the one who fabricates lies against Allah or says, “A revelation has come to me” – whereas nothing has been revealed to him, or the one who says, “I can send down the like of what Allah has sent down.” If only you could see the wrongdoers in the throes of death while the angels are stretching out their hands [saying], “Give up your souls! Today you will be recompensed with a disgracing punishment, because you used to tell lies against Allah and you arrogantly rejected His verses.”"}
