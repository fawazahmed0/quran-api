{"chapter":57,"verse":20,"text":"Know that the life of this world is no more than play, amusement, adornment, boasting among yourselves, and a competition in wealth and children. It is like plants that flourish after rain, pleasing the sowers, then they wither and you see them turning yellow, then they crumble. And in the Hereafter there will be severe punishment, or forgiveness from Allah and His pleasure. For the life of this world is no more than a fleeting enjoyment"}
