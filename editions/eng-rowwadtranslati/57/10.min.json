{"chapter":57,"verse":10,"text":"Why is it that you do not spend in the cause of Allah, when Allah alone will inherit the heavens and earth? Those of you who spent and fought before the conquest [of Mecca and those who did not] are not equal. They are much greater in rank than those who spent and fought afterwards. Yet Allah has promised each a fine reward, and Allah is All-Aware of what you do"}
