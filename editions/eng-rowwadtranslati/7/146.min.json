{"chapter":7,"verse":146,"text":"I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant in the land without any right. Even if they see every sign, they will still not believe in it; if they see the way of guidance, they will not follow it, but if they see the way of misguidance, they will follow it as their way. That is because they have rejected Our signs and were heedless of them"}
