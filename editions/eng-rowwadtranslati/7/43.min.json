{"chapter":7,"verse":43,"text":"We will remove all ill feelings from their hearts and rivers will flow beneath them. They will say, “All praise be to Allah Who has guided us to this, for We would not have been guided to this if Allah had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord came with the truth.” They will be called, “This is Paradise that you are made to inherit for what you used to do.”"}
