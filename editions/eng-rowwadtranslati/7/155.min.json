{"chapter":7,"verse":155,"text":"Moses chose seventy men from among his people for Our appointment. When the earthquake seized them, he said, “My Lord, had it been Your will, You could have destroyed them earlier, and me too; will You destroy us for what the fools among us have done? This is not but a trial from You, by which You cause to stray whom you will and guide whom You will. You are our Guardian, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, for You are the Best of Forgivers"}
