{"chapter":2,"verse":246,"text":"Did you not see the chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses when they said to their prophet: “Appoint for us a king, so that we fight in the way of Allah.” He said: “How likely is it that if fighting was enjoined upon you that you will not fight?” They said: “How could we not fight in the way of Allah, while we have been driven out of our homes and separated from our children?” However, when fighting was enjoined upon them, they turned away, except a few of them. And Allah is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers"}
