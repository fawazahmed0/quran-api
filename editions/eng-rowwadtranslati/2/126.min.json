{"chapter":2,"verse":126,"text":"And [remember] when Abraham said, “My Lord, make this city [of Makkah] a sanctuary and provide its people with fruits – those among them who believe in Allah and the Last Day.” [Allah] said, “As for those who disbelieve, I will grant them enjoyment for a short while, then I will force them into the punishment of the Fire. What a terrible destination!”"}
