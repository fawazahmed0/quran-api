{"chapter":2,"verse":228,"text":"Divorced women should wait for three menstrual cycles. It is not permissible for them to hide what Allah has created in their wombs, if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their husbands have the greater right to take them back within that period, if they want reconciliation. Women have rights similar to the rights over them in a reasonable manner, although men have a higher degree [of responsibility] over them. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise"}
