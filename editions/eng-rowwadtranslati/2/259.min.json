{"chapter":2,"verse":259,"text":"Or [have you considered] the one who passed by a town in ruins with its roofs collapsed? He said: “How can Allah revive them after their death?” Then Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then revived him. He said, “How long have you remained [dead]?” He said, “I have remained for a day or part of a day”. He said, “No, but you have remained for a hundred years. Look at your food and your drink; they have not changed. But look at your donkey, so that We make you a sign for people. Look at the bones, how We bring them together then cover them with flesh.” When this was made clear to him, he said: “I know that Allah is Most Capable of all things.”"}
