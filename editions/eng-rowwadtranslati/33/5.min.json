{"chapter":33,"verse":5,"text":"Call them [adopted sons] after their real fathers; that is more equitable before Allah. But if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brothers in faith and your patronized associates. There is no blame on you if you make a mistake in that regard, but only for what your hearts intend. And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"}
