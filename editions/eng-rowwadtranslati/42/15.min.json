{"chapter":42,"verse":15,"text":"Therefore call to that [religion, O Prophet] and keep to the straight path as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires, and say, “I believe in every Scripture that Allah has sent down, and I have been commanded to judge fairly among you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. We have our deeds and you have your deeds. Let there be no [further] argument between us and you; Allah will bring us together, and to Him is the final return.”"}
