{"chapter":11,"verse":31,"text":"I do not tell you that I have Allah’s treasures or that I know the unseen, nor do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say about those whom you look down upon, that Allah will never grant them any good, for Allah knows best what is in their hearts. If I did so, I would surely be one of the wrongdoers.”"}
