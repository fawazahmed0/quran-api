{"chapter":11,"verse":61,"text":"To the people of Thamūd, We sent their brother Sālih. He said, “O my people, worship Allah; you have no god except Him. It is He Who brought you into being from the earth and settled you therein. So seek His forgiveness then turn to Him in repentance, for My Lord is Ever Near, All-Responsive.”"}
