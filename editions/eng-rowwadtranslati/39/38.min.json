{"chapter":39,"verse":38,"text":"If you ask them who created the heavens and earth, they will surely say, “Allah.” Say, “Then tell me about those whom you supplicate besides Allah; if Allah wills to harm me, can they remove His harm? Or if He wills mercy for me, can they withhold His mercy?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me; in Him alone do the reliant put their trust.”"}
