{"chapter":34,"verse":31,"text":"Those who disbelieve say, “We will never believe in this Qur’an or in any [Scripture] before it.” If only you could see when the wrongdoers will be made to stand before their Lord, throwing blame at one another! Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, “Had it not been for you, we would have been believers.”"}
