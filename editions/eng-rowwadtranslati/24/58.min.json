{"chapter":24,"verse":58,"text":"O you who believe, let your slaves and those among you who have not reached puberty ask for your permission [to enter] at three times: before dawn prayer, when you take off your outer garments at noon, and after the night prayer; three times of privacy for you. Beyond that there is no blame on you nor on them to move about freely, attending to one another. This is how Allah makes the verses clear to you, for Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"}
