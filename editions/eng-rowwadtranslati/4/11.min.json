{"chapter":4,"verse":11,"text":"Allah instructs you concerning [the inheritance of] your children: the share of a male is equal to that of two females. If there are only daughters, two or more, they get two-thirds of the estate, but if there is only one daughter, she gets half. Each parent is entitled to one-sixth if he left offspring, but if he left no offspring and the parents are the only heirs, the mother gets one-third, but if he has siblings, the mother gets one-sixth, after settling any bequests or debts. Your parents and your children, you do not know which of them will benefit you more. [These shares are] ordained by Allah; and Allah is All-Knowing, All-Wise"}
