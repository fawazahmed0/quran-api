{"chapter":4,"verse":95,"text":"Not equal are those believers who stay behind – except those forced by necessity – and those who fight in the way of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has given a higher rank to those who fight with their wealth and their lives than those who stay behind. To each Allah has promised a fine reward, but Allah has favored those who fight over those who stay behind with a great reward"}
