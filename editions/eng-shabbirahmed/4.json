In this situation the individual and the society complement each other (14:34). At the outset, it is imperative for you, O Mankind, to know that all of you, men and women, have a common origin. Your Lord began the creation of life at the unicellular level. There was one life cell that divided into two, male and female (6:99). Evolution took place, as has been alluded to in this Book (16:8), (20:50), (21:30), (22:45), (30:20), (31:28), (51:49). Eventually, numerous men and women came into existence on the earth. Since all of you have this common origin, you must consider all mankind as one community (10:19), (57:25). Your first step in that direction is to strengthen your family relations. Be careful of your duty to Allah in Whose Name you expect rights from one another. Allah ever Watches over you"
