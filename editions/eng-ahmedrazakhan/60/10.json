    "text": "O People who Believe! When Muslim women leave the lands of disbelief and migrate towards you, examine them; Allah knows more about their faith; so if you judge the women to be believers, do not send them back to the disbelievers; neither are they lawful for the disbelievers, nor are the disbelievers lawful for them; and give their disbelieving husbands what they had spent; and there is no sin upon you to marry them if you give them their bridal money; and do not continue the marriage with disbelieving women – and ask for what you had spent, and the disbelievers may ask for what they had spent; this is Allah’s command; He judges between you; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise"
