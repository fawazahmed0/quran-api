{"chapter":60,"verse":1,"text":"O People who Believe! Do not befriend My and your enemy – you reveal secrets to them out of friendship whereas they disbelieve in the truth which has come to you! It is they who remove the Noble Messenger and you from your homes, upon your believing in Allah, your Lord; if you have come out to fight for My cause, and to gain My pleasure, then do not befriend them; you send them secret messages of friendship – and I well know all what you hide and all what you disclose; and whoever among you does it, has indeed strayed away from the right path"}
