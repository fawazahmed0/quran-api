{"chapter":3,"verse":144,"text":"And Mohammed (peace and blessings be upon him) is purely* a Noble Messenger; there have been Noble Messengers before him; so if he departs or is martyred, will you turn back on your heels? So whoever turns back on his heels does not cause any harm to Allah; and Allah will soon reward the thankful. (* Neither God nor an angel, but a human being with the highest spiritual status)"}
