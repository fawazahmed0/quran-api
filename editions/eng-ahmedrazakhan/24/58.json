    "text": "O People who Believe! The slaves you possess and those among you who have not attained adulthood, must seek your permission on three occasions; before the dawn prayer, and when you remove your garments in the afternoon, and after the night prayer; these three times are of privacy for you; other than these three times, it is no sin for you or for them; moving about around you and among each other; and this is how Allah explains the verses for you; and Allah is All Knowing, Wise"
