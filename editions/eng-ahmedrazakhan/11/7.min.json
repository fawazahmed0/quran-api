{"chapter":11,"verse":7,"text":"And it is He Who created the heavens and the earth in six days – and His Throne was upon the water – so that He might test you, as to who among you have the best deeds*; and if you (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him) say, “Indeed you will be raised again after death”, the disbelievers will surely say, “This is nothing but clear magic.” (* The creation of all things is in order to test mankind)"}
