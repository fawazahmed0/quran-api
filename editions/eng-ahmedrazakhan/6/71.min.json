{"chapter":6,"verse":71,"text":"Say, “Shall we worship, other than Allah, that which neither benefits us nor harms us, and (therefore) be turned back after Allah has guided us, like one whom the devils have led astray in the earth – bewildered?; his companions call him to the path (saying), ‘Come here’”; say, “Indeed only the guidance of Allah is (the true) guidance; and we are commanded to submit to the Lord Of The Creation.”"}
