{"chapter":6,"verse":94,"text":"“And indeed you (the disbelievers) have now come to Us alone as We had created you at first, and you have left behind you all the wealth and riches We had bestowed upon you; and We do not see your intercessors along with you, whom you claimed to possess a share in you; indeed the link between yourselves is cut off, and you have lost all what you contended.”"}
