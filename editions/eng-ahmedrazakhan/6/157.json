    "text": "Or may say that, “If the Book had been sent down to us, we would have been more upon guidance than them”; so the clear proof and guidance and mercy has come to you, from your Lord; so who is more unjust than one who denies the signs of Allah, and turns away from them? We shall soon punish those who turn away from Our signs with a great punishment, the recompense of their turning away"
