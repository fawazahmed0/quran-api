When you go forth to fight in holy war, make a proper study, and do not say to the one who greets you, “You are not a Muslim,” – you seek the means of this worldly life; so with Allah are the bounties in plenty; you too were like this before, then Allah bestowed His favour on you, therefore you must make a proper study; indeed Allah knows whatever you do"}
