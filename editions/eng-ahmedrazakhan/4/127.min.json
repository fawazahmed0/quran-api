{"chapter":4,"verse":127,"text":"And they ask you the decree concerning women; say, “Allah gives you a decree concerning them – and what is recited to you from the Qur’an concerning orphan girls, that you are not giving them which is ordained for them, and you are avoiding marrying them – and concerning the weak children, and that you must firmly establish justice in dealing with the orphans’ rights; and whatever good deeds you do, then Allah is Well Aware of it.”"}
