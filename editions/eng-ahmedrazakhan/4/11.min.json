{"chapter":4,"verse":11,"text":"Allah commands you concerning your children; the son’s share is equal to that of two daughters; and if there are only daughters, for them is two-thirds of the inheritance, even if they are more than two; and if there is only one daughter, for her is half; and to each of the deceased’s parents a sixth of the inheritance, if he has children; and if the deceased has no children but leaves behind parents, then one third for the mother; and if he has several brothers and sisters, a sixth for the mother, after any will he may have made and payment of debt; your fathers and your sons – you do not know which of them will be more useful to you; this is the share fixed by Allah; indeed Allah is All Knowing, Wise"}
