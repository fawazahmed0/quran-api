    "text": "And the one who said to his parents, “Uff – I am fed up with both of you! What! You promise me that I will be raised again whereas generations have passed away before me?” And they both seek Allah’s help and say to him, “May you be ruined, accept faith! Indeed Allah’s promise is true”; he therefore answers, “This is nothing except stories of former people.”"
