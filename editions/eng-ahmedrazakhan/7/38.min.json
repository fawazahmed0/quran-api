{"chapter":7,"verse":38,"text":"Allah says to them, “Join the groups of jinns and mankind who have entered hell before you”; when a group enters, it curses the other; until when they have all gone in, the latter groups will say regarding the former, “Our Lord! It is these who led us astray, so give them double the punishment of the fire”; He will say, “For each one is double – but you do not know.”"}
