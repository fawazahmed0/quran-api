{"chapter":33,"verse":37,"text":"And O dear Prophet, remember when you said to him upon whom Allah has bestowed favour and you had bestowed favour, “Keep your wife with you, and fear Allah”, and you kept in your heart what Allah willed to make known, and you feared criticism from the people; and Allah has more right that you should fear Him; so when Zaid became unconcerned with her, We gave her to you in marriage, so that there may be no sin upon believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when they have become unconcerned with them; and the command of Allah must be carried out"}
