    "text": "O People who Believe! The witnesses between you when death approaches any one of you, at the time of making a will, should be two reliable men from among you, or two from another tribe in case you are travelling in the land and the event of death approaches you; engage them after the prayers, and if you doubt, they must swear by Allah that, “We shall not exchange our oaths for any price even if he is a near relative, nor will we hide the testimony of Allah – if we do, then surely we are of the sinners.”"
