{"chapter":73,"verse":20,"text":"Indeed your Lord knows that you stand up in prayer, sometimes almost two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half the night or sometimes a third of it – and also a group of those along with you; Allah keeps measure of the night and day; He knows that you, O Muslims, will not be able to measure the night, so He has inclined towards you with mercy – therefore recite from the Qur’an as much as is easy for you; He knows that soon some of you will fall ill, and some will travel in the land seeking the munificence of Allah, and some will be fighting in Allah’s cause; therefore recite from the Qur’an as much as is easy for you, and establish prayer and pay the obligatory charity, and lend an excellent loan to Allah; and whatever good you send ahead for yourselves, you will find it with Allah, better and having a great reward; and seek forgiveness from Allah; indeed Allah is Oft Forgiving, Most Merciful"}
