{"chapter":2,"verse":259,"text":"Or like him* who passed by a dwelling and it had fallen flat on its roofs; he said, “How will Allah bring it to life, after its death?”; so Allah kept him dead for a hundred years, then brought him back to life; He said, “How long have you stayed here?”; he replied, “I may have stayed for a day or little less”; He said, “In fact, you have spent a hundred years – so look at your food and drink which do not even smell stale; and look at your donkey whose bones even are not intact – in order that We may make you a sign for mankind – and look at the bones how We assemble them and then cover them with flesh”; so when the matter became clear to him, he said, “I know well that Allah is Able to do all things.” (Prophet Uzair – peace be upon him)"}
