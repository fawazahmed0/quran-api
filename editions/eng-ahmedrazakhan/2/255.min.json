{"chapter":2,"verse":255,"text":"Allah – there is no God except Him; He is Alive (eternally, on His own) and the Upholder (keeps others established); He never feels drowsy nor does He sleep; to Him only belongs all whatever is in the heavens and all whatever is in the earth; who is he that can intercede* with Him except by His command? He knows what is in front of them and what is behind them; and they do not achieve anything of His knowledge except what He wills; His Throne (of Sovereignty) encompasses the heavens and the earth; and it is not difficult for Him to guard them; and He is the Supreme, the Greatest. (This Verse is popularly known as Ayat Al-Kursi. It has a special status and reciting it carries great reward. *Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him – will be the first one to be granted the permission to intercede, others will follow)"}
