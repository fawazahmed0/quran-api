{"chapter":2,"verse":61,"text":"And when you said, “O Moosa! We shall never put up with only one kind of food, so call upon your Lord to produce for us what the earth grows – some herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils and onions”; he said, “What! You wish to exchange the better for something inferior? Therefore settle down in Egypt or any city, where you will get what you demand”; and disgrace and misery were destined for them; and they returned towards Allah’s wrath; that was because they disbelieved in Allah’s signs and wrongfully martyred the Prophets; that was for their disobedience and transgression"}
