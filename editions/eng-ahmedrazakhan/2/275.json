    "text": "Those who devour usury will not stand up on the Day of Judgement, except like the one whom an evil jinn has deranged by his touch; that is because they said, “Trade is also like usury!”; whereas Allah has made trading lawful and forbidden usury; for one to whom the guidance has come from his Lord, and he refrained therefrom, is lawful what he has taken in the past; and his affair is with Allah; and whoever continues earning it henceforth, is of the people of fire; they will remain in it for ages"
