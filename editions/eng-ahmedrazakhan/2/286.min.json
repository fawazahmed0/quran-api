{"chapter":2,"verse":286,"text":"Allah does not burden anyone, except with something within its capacity; beneficial for it is the virtue it earned, and harmful for it is the evil it earned; “Our Lord! Do not seize us if we forget or are mistaken; our Lord! And do not place on us a heavy burden (responsibility) as You did on those before us; our Lord! And do not impose on us a burden, for which we do not have the strength; and pardon us – and forgive us – and have mercy on us – You are our Master, therefore help us against the disbelievers.”"}
