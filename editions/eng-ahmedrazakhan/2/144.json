    "text": "We observe you turning your face, several times towards heaven (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him); so We will definitely make you turn (for prayer) towards a qiblah which pleases you; therefore now turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque (in Mecca); and O Muslims, wherever you may be, turn your faces (for prayer) towards it only; and those who have received the Book surely know that this is the truth from their Lord; and Allah is not unaware of their deeds. (Allah seeks to please the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him)"
