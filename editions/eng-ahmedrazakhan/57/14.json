    "text": "The hypocrites will call out to the Muslims, “Were we not with you?”; they will answer, “Yes you were, why not? But you had put your souls into trial, and you used to await misfortune for the Muslims, and you doubted, and false hopes deceived you until Allah’s command came – and the big cheat had made you conceited towards the command of Allah.”"
