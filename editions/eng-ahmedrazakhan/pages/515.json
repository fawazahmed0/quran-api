Do not raise your voices higher than the voice of the Prophet, nor speak to him loudly the way you shout to one another, lest your deeds go to waste whilst you are unaware. (Faith will go waste due to the slightest disrespect towards the Holy Prophet – peace and blessings be upon him. To honour him is part of faith. To disrespect him is blasphemy)"
