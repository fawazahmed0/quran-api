Wherever there is any discussion among three He is the fourth present with them, and among five He is the sixth, and there is no discussion among fewer or more except that He is with them wherever they may be; and then on the Day of Resurrection He will inform them of all what they did; indeed Allah knows all things"

And when they come in your presence, they greet you with words not chosen by Allah for respectfully greeting you, and they inwardly say, “Why does not Allah punish us for what we say?”; hell is sufficient for them; they will sink into it; and what a wretched outcome"
