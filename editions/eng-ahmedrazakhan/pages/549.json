It is they who remove the Noble Messenger and you from your homes, upon your believing in Allah, your Lord; if you have come out to fight for My cause, and to gain My pleasure, then do not befriend them; you send them secret messages of friendship – and I well know all what you hide and all what you disclose; and whoever among you does it, has indeed strayed away from the right path"
