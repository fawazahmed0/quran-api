    "text": "Say (O dear Prophet Mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him), “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?” Proclaim, “Allah”; Say, “So have you appointed such as supporters besides Him, who can neither benefit nor harm themselves?”; say, “Will the blind and the sighted ever be equal? Or will the realms of darkness and the light ever be equal?” Have they appointed such as partners to Allah who created something like Allah did? Therefore their creation and His creation seemed alike to them? Proclaim, “Allah is the Creator of all things, and He Alone is the Dominant over all.”"
