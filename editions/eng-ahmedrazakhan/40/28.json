    "text": "And said a Muslim man from the people of Firaun, who used to hide his faith, “What! You want to kill a man just because he says, ‘Allah is my Lord’ whereas he has indeed brought clear signs to you from your Lord? And supposedly if he is speaking wrongly, then the calamity of wrongful speech is upon him; and if he is truthful, then part of what he promises you will reach you; indeed Allah does not guide any transgressor, excessive liar.”"
