    "text": "Nor may you claim that: ´Had the Book been revealed to us, we would have been better guided than they.´ Surely clear evidence has come to you from your Lord, which is both a guidance and a mercy. Who, then, is more unjust than he who gave the lie to the signs of Allah and turned away from them? And We shall soon requite those who turn away from Our signs with a severe chastisement for having turned away"
