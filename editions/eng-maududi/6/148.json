    "text": "Those who associate others with Allah in His divinity will now surely say: ´Had Allah willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated others with Allah in His divinity, nor would we have declared anything (which Allah did not forbid) as forbidden.´ Even so those who had lived before them gave the lie (to the Truth) until they tasted Our chastisement. Tell them: ´Have you any sure knowledge that you can produce before us? In fact you are only following idle fancies, merely conjecturing.´"
