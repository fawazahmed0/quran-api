    "text": "They say: ´These animals and these crops are sacrosanct: none may eat of them save those whom we will´ - imposing interdictions of their own contriving. And they declare that it is forbidden to burden the backs of certain cattle, and these are the cattle over which they do not pronounce the name of Allah. All these are false fabrications against Allah, and He will soon requite them for all that they fabricate"
