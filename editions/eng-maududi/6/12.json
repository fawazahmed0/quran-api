    "text": "Ask thern: ´To whom belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth?´ Say: ´Everything belongs to Allah.´ He has bound Himself to the exercise of mercy (and thus does not chastise you for your disobedience and excesses instantly). Surely He will gather you all together on the Day of Resurrection - the coming of which is beyond doubt; but those who have courted their own ruin are not going to believe"
