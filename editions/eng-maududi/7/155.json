    "text": "And out of his people Moses singled out seventy men for Our appointment. Then, when violent shaking seized them, he addressed his Lord: ´Had You willed, O my Lord, You could have destroyed them and me long ago. Will You destroy us for what the fools amongst us did? That was nothing but a trial from You whereby You mislead whom You will and guide whom You will. You alone are our guardian. Forgive us, then, and have mercy upon us. You are the best of those who forgive"
