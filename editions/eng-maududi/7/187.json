    "text": "They ask you concerning the Hour, when will its coming be? Say: ´The knowledge of it is with my Lord alone: none but He will disclose it at its time. That will weigh heavily on the heavens and the earth; and it shall not come to you other than all of a sudden.´ They ask you - as if you are eagerly inquisitive about it - concerning it. Say to them: ´The knowledge of it is with none except Allah. But most people are unaware of this reality.´"
