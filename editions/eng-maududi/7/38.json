    "text": "Allah ivill say: ´Enter the fire of Hell and join the nations of jinn and men that have gone before You.´ As a nation enters Hill, it will curse the one that went before it, and when all are gathered there, the last of them shall say of the first: ´Our Lord! These are the ones who led us astray. Let their torment be doubled in Hell-Fire.´ He will answer: ´Each will have a doubled torment; although you do not know.´"
