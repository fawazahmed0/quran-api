    "text": "And We divided them into twelve tribes, forming them into communities. When his people asked Moses for water We directed him: ´Smite the rock with your rod.´ Then twelve springs gushed forth from the rock and every people knew their drinking-places. And We caused thick clouds to provide them shade, and We sent down upon them manna and quails, saying: ´Eat of the clean things that We have provided you.´ They wronged not Us, but it was themselves that they wronged"
