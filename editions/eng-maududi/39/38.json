    "text": "If you ask them: \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" they will surely answer: \"Allah.\" Tell them: \"What do you think, then, of the deities whom you call upon instead of Allah? If Allah should will that an affliction befall me, will those deities remove the harm inflicted by Him? Or if Allah should will that I receive (His) Mercy, will they be able to withhold His Mercy from me?\" Say: \"Allah is sufficient for me; those who have to put their trust, let them put their trust in Him"
