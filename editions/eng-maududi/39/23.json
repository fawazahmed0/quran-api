    "text": "Allah has revealed the best teaching, a self-consistent Book which repeats its contents in manifold forms whereat shiver the skins of those that hold their Lord in awe, and then their skins and their hearts soften for Allah´s remembrance. That is Allah´s Guidance wherewith He guides whosoever He pleases. And he whom Allah does not guide to the Right Path has none to guide him"
