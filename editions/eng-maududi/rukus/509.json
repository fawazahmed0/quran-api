            "text": "(O Prophet), your Lord knows that you sometimes stand up in Prayer nearly two-thirds of the night, and sometimes half or one-third of it, and so does a party of those with you; Allah measures the night and the day. He knows that you cannot keep an accurate count of it, so He has shown mercy to you. So now recite as much of the Qur´an as you can. He knows that there are among you those who are sick and others who are journeying in the land in quest of Allah´s bounty, and still others who are fighting in the cause of Allah. So recite as much of the Qur´an as you easily can, and establish Prayer, and pay Zakah, and give Allah a goodly loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you shall find it with Allah. That is better and its reward is greater. And ask for Allah´s forgiveness; surely He is Most Forgiving, Most Compassionate"
