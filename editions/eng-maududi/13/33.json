    "text": "Is it, then, in regard to Him Who watches over the deeds of every person that they are acting blasphemously by setting up His associates? Tell them: \"Name those associates (if Allah Himself has made them His associates)! Or are you informing Allah of something the existence of which He does not even know?\" Or do people arbitrarily utter empty words? Indeed, their foul contriving has been made to seem fair to the unbelievers and they have been barred from finding the Right Way. Whomsoever Allah lets go astray will have none to guide him"
