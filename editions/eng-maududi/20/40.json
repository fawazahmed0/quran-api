    "text": "Recall, when your sister went along, saying: ´Shall I direct you to one who will take charge of him?´ Thus We brought you back to your mother so that her heart might be gladdened and she might not grieve. Moses, recall when you slew a person. We delivered you from distress and made you go through several trials. Then you stayed for several years among the people of Midian, and now you have come at the right moment as ordained"
