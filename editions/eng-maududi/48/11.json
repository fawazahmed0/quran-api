    "text": "(O Prophet), the bedouins who were left behind say to you: \"We were occupied with our goods and families. So ask forgiveness for us.\" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say to them: \"Who can be of any avail to you against Allah if He should intend to cause you any harm or confer upon you any benefit?\" Allah is well aware of all that you do"
