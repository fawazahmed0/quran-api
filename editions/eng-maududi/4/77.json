    "text": "Have you not seen those who were told: ´Restrain you hands, and establish the Prayer, and pay the Zakah´? But when fighting was enjoined upon them some of them feared men as one should fear Allah, or even more, and said: ´Our Lord, why have You ordained fighting for us? Why did You not grant us a little more respite?´ Say to them: ´There is little enjoyment in this world. The World to Come is much better for the God-fearing. And you shall not be wronged even to the extent of the husk of a date-stone"
