    "text": "Who is more wicked than the man who, when he is reminded by the revelations of his Lord, turns away from them and forgets (the consequence of) the deeds wrought by his own hands? We have laid veils over their hearts lest they understand the message of the Qur´an, and We have caused heaviness in their ears. Call them as you may to the Right Path, they will not be ever guided aright"
