    "text": "(O Prophet), call to mind when you said to himwhom Allah had favoured and you had favoured: \"Cleave to your wife and fear Allah,\" and you concealed within yourself for fear of people what Allah was to reveal, although Allah has greater right that you fear Him. So when Zayd had accomplished what he would of her, We gave her in marriage to you so that there should not be any constraint for the believers regarding the wives of their adopted sons after they had accomplished whatever they would of them. And Allah´s command was bound to be accomplished"
