    "text": "The man from Egypt who bought him said to his wife: \"Take good care of him, possibly he might be of benefit to us or we might adopt him as a son.\" Thus We found a way for Joseph to become established in that land and in order that We might teach him to comprehend the deeper meaning of things. Allah has full power to implement His design although most people do not know that"
