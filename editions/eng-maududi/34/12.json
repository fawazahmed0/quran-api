    "text": "And We subdued the wind to Solomon: its morning course was a month´s journey and its evening course was a month´s journey. We gave him a spring flowing with molten brass, and We subdued for him jinn who, by his Lord´s permission, worked before him. Such of them as swerved from Our commandment, We let them taste the chastisement of the Blazing Fire"
