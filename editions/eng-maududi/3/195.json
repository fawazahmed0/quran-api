    "text": "Their Lord answered the Prayer thus: \"I will not suffer the work of any of you, whether male or female, to go to waste; each of you is from the other. Those who emigrated and were driven out from their homesteads and were persecuted in My cause, and who fought and were slain, indeed I shall wipe out their evil deeds from them and shall certainly admit them to the gardens beneath which rivers flow.\" This is their reward with their Lord; and with Allah lies the best reward"
