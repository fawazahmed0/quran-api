    "text": "Then, after inflict-ing this grief, He sent down an inner peace upon you - a sleep which overtook some of you. Those who were concerned merely about themselves, entertaining false notions about Allah - the notions of the Age of Ignorance - asked: ´Have we any say in the matter?´ Tell them: ´Truly, all power of decision rests solely with Allah.´ Indeed, they conceal in their hearts what they would not reveal to you, saying: ´If we had any power of decision, we would not have been slain here.´ Say: ´Even if you had been in your houses, those for whom slaying had been appointed would have gone forth to the places where they were to be slain.´ And all this happened so that Allah might test your secret thoughts and purge your hearts of all impurities. Allah knows well what is in the breasts of men"
