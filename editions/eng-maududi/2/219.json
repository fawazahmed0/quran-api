Say: “In both these there is great evil, even though there is some benefit for people, but their evil is greater than their benefit.” They ask: “What should we spend in the Way of Allah?” Say: “Whatever you can spare.” In this way Allah clearly expounds His injunctions to you that you may reflect upon them"
