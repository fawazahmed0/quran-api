But those in whose hearts is perversity follow the part thereof that is allegorical, seeking discord, and searching for its hidden meanings, but no one knows its hidden meanings except God. And those who are firmly grounded in knowledge say: \"We believe in the Book; the whole of it is from our Lord:\" and none will grasp the Message except men of understanding"
