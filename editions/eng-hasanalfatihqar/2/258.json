    "text": "Have you not seen he who argued with Abraham about his Lord that Allah had given him the kingship! When Abraham said: 'My Lord is He who revives, and causes to die' He said: 'I revive, and cause to die' Abraham said: 'Allah brings up the sun from the east; so you bring it from the west' Then he who disbelieved became pale. Allah does not guide the nation, the harmdoers"
