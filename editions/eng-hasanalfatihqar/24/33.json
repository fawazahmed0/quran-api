    "text": "Let those who do not find the means to marry be abstinent until Allah enriches them of His bounty. Those your right hand owns who seek their freedom, make a contract with them accordingly if you know some good in them, and give them from the wealth of Allah that He has given you. Do not force your slavegirls into prostitution in order to seek worldly gain for they wish to preserve their chastity. Whosoever compels them, surely Allah, after their being compelled, is the Forgiver (to the girls), the Most Merciful"
