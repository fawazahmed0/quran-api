{"chapter":24,"verse":62,"text":"The believers are only those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, and who, when gathered with him upon a common matter do not depart till they have asked his permission. Surely, those who ask your permission are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. When they ask your permission for some of their affairs, grant it to whomever you please and ask Allah for forgiveness for them; Allah is the Forgiver, the Merciful"}
