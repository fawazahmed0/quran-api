They pervert the words in their places and say: 'If you are given this, accept it; if not, then beware' Whomsoever Allah wishes to try, you will not own anything with Allah concerning him. For those whose hearts Allah does not will to purify shall be disgrace in this world and a grievous punishment in the Everlasting Life"
