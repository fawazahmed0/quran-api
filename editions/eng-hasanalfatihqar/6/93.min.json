{"chapter":6,"verse":93,"text":"Who is more harmful than he who invents a lie about Allah, or says: \"It has been revealed to me,\" when nothing has been revealed to him? Or he who says: 'I will send down the like of what Allah has sent down' Would that you could see the harmdoers when death overwhelms them! With hands outstretched, the angels (will say): 'Yield up your souls. You shall be recompensed with a humiliating punishment this Day, for you have said of Allah what is untrue and you grew proud against His verses"}
