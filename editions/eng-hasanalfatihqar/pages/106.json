Say: 'Allah rules for you concerning the indirect heir (alkalalah which is), if a person dies, having no children, but he has a sister, she shall receive half of what he leaves, and he is her heir if she has no children. If there are two sisters, they shall receive twothirds of what he leaves, if there are siblings, men and women, for a male like the share of two females. Allah clarifies to you, lest you go astray, Allah is Knowledgeable of everything"

Once your pilgrimage has ended, you are free to hunt. Do not allow your hatred for a nation who would bar you from the Holy Mosque to lead you to transgress. And cooperate in righteousness and warding off (evil), and do not cooperate in sinfulness and transgression. Have fear of Allah, for Allah is Stern in retribution"
