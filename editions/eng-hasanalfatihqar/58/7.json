    "text": "Have you not seen that Allah knows that which is in the heavens and the earth? There is no secret talk between three but He is the fourth of them; nor between five but He is the sixth of them; nor between fewer or more but He is with them wherever they are. Then, on the Day of Resurrection, He will inform them of what they have done. Surely, Allah has knowledge of all things"
