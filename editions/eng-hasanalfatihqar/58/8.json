They return to that which they are forbidden and talk secretly together in sin andhatred, and in disobedience to the Messenger. Then, when they come to you they greet you with greetings with which Allah does not greet you, and they say within themselves: 'Why does Allah not punish us for what we say' Gehenna (Hell) suffices them, they shall be roasted, an evil arrival"
