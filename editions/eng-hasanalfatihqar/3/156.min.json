{"chapter":3,"verse":156,"text":"Believers, do not be as those who disbelieve and say of their brothers when they journey in the land or go of to battle: 'Had they stayed with us, they would not have died, nor would they have been killed' In order that Allah will make that a regret in their hearts. Allah revives and causes to die. He has knowledge of what you do"}
