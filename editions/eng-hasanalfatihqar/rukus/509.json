He knows that you cannot count it, and turns to you. Therefore, recite from the Koran as much as is easy (for you); He knows that among youthere are the sick and others traveling the road seeking the bounty of Allah; and others fighting in the Way of Allah. So then, recite from it as much as is easy. Establish your prayers, pay the obligatory charity, and lend Allah a generous loan. Whatever good you shall forward to your souls' account, you surely will find it better with Allah, and a mightier wage. And supplicate for the forgiveness of Allah. Allah is the Forgiving, the Merciful"
