{"chapter":4,"verse":77,"text":"Have you not seen those to whom it has been said: 'Restrain your hands, establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity' Then, as soon as fighting is written for them, there is a party of them fearing people as they would fear Allah, or with stronger fear. And they say: 'Our Lord, why have You written fighting for us, why not postpone us to a near term' Say: 'The pleasure of this life is little. The Everlasting Life is better for the cautious. You shall not be wronged a single tissue (of the fine skin that covers a date stone)"}
