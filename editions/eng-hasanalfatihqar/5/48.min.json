{"chapter":5,"verse":48,"text":"And to you We have revealed the Book with the truth confirming the Book that was revealed before it, and a guardian over it. Therefore, give judgment among them in accordance to what Allah has sent down and do not yield to their fancies from the truth that has come to you. We have ordained a law and a Path for each of you. Had Allah willed, He could have made you one nation but that He might try you by that which He has bestowed upon you. Race with one another in good works, to Allah you shall all return and He will declare to you what you were at variance"}
