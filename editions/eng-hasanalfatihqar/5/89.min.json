{"chapter":5,"verse":89,"text":"Allah will not take you to account for a slip in your oaths. But He will take you to account for the oaths which you solemnly swear. Its expiation is the feeding of ten needy (people) with such food as you normally offer to your own people; or the clothing of them; or the freeing of a slave. He who does not have must fast three days. That is the expiation of your oaths when you have sworn; but keep your oaths. Allah makes plain to you His verses, in order that you are thankful"}
