Protagonists of this theory assert that mankind evolved itself from lower forms of life through processes of natural selection and survival of the fittest. They reject the Qur'aanic assertion that a Super-intelligent, Omniscient and Omnipresent Being has consciously, deliberately or purposefully created mankind and everything else in the Universe. The thought of such a Creator is anathema for the atheists subscribing to the theory of evolution. This theory could well be the creature spoken of in this Verse, telling those who believe in it that they have no real faith in the Qur'aanic Verses/signs.
