    "text": "God! There is no god except He, the Living, the Everlasting. Neither slumber overtakes Him, nor sleep. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and everything on earth.

His Throne extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation does not burden Him. He is the Most High, the Great"
