{"chapter":48,"verse":25,"text":"Those were the persons who did not believe and turned you away from the Sacred Mosque and stopped the offering from reaching its destination. And had believing men and believing women not been there, whom you did not know and whom you would have trampled, then distress would have befallen you on account of them, unknowingly. (You were held back) so that Allah may make to enter into His mercy, whom He wills. Had they (the believers and infidels) been separated (one from another). We would have punished those who did not believe from among them, with a painful punishment"}
