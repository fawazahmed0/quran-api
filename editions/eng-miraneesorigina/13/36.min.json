{"chapter":13,"verse":36,"text":"And those whom We gave the book are happy because of that which is sent down to you. And from among the parties, is he who does not recognise a part of it. Say, “I am commanded that I should serve only Allah and that I should not associate partners with Him. Towards Him do I invite and towards Him is my return.”"}
