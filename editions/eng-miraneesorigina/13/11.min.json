{"chapter":13,"verse":11,"text":"For him there are (angels) following him closely, before him and behind him, protecting him by the command of Allah. Allah certainly does not change (the condition) in which a people are, until they change that which is in their souls. And when Allah intends evil for a people then there is no turning it back, and besides Him there is no guardian for them"}
