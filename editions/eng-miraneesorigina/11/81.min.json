{"chapter":11,"verse":81,"text":"They (messengers) said, “O Lut ! we are messengers of your Fosterer, they cannot (even) approach towards you. So travel with your people during a part of the night, and do not let anyone of you turn back, except your wife, that which befalls them will certainly befall her. Certainly, their promised time is the morning. Is not the morn near?”"}
