{"chapter":11,"verse":31,"text":"And I do not say to you that with me are treasures of Allah, nor do I know the unseen, and I do not say to you that I am an angel and I do not say about those whom your eyes hold in low estimation that Allah will never grant them good, Allah knows best that which is there in their souls, then I will certainly be of those who are unjust.”"}
