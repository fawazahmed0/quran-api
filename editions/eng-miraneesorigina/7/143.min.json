{"chapter":7,"verse":143,"text":"And when Musa came at the time/place appointed by Us and his Fosterer spoke to him, he said, \"My Fosterer ! show me (Yourself) that I may look at You.\" He said, \"You cannot see Me, but look at the mountain, so if it stays in its place then you will (be able to) see Me.\" So when his Fosterer unveiled Himself to the mountain, He made it crumble to pieces and Musa fell down senseless. Then when he recovered he said, \"Glory be to You ! I turn to You (for mercy) and I am the first of the believers"}
