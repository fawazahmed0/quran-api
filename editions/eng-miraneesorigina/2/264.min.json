{"chapter":2,"verse":264,"text":"O you who believe ! do not make your charity worthless by stressing your obligation and annoying (those whom you give charity), like him who spends his wealth to be seen by people and does not believe in Allah and the period hereafter; then the likeness of him is like the likeness of the rock over which is soil, when heavy rain falls on it, then it leaves it smooth. They will not have power over anything of that which they earned (that is, their charity will be worthless), and Allah does not guide a people who are infidels"}
