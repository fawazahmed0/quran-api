{"chapter":2,"verse":255,"text":"Allah, there is no god except Him, the Living, the Eternally Existing; neither slumber takes hold of Him nor sleep; whatever is in the skies and whatever is in the earth is His. Who is there who can recommend to Him except by His permission? He knows that which is before them and that which is behind them, and they cannot encompass anything from His knowledge except that which He wills (to impart); His Chair (power, jurisdiction) extends over the skies and the earth and it does not tire Him to preserve (monitor) them both, and He is the High, the Great"}
