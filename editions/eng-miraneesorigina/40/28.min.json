{"chapter":40,"verse":28,"text":"And a believing man from among Firawn’s people who had kept his belief a secret, said, “Do you kill a man ( just ) because he says: My Fosterer is Allah and he has come to you with clear proofs from your Fosterer? And if he is a liar then on him will be ( the responsibility of ) his lie, but if he is truthful, then something of that which he is threatening you ( with ), will afflict you. Allah certainly does not guide him who is extravagant, a liar"}
