{"chapter":4,"verse":94,"text":"O you who believe ! when you go striking in the way of Allah, carefully investigate and do not say to one who offers you peace, (or salutation), \"You are not a believer,\" seeking apparent good of the life of this world (by way of taking away his belongings as booty of war), because with Allah is abundant gain (better than the booty of war). Earlier, you too were like that but Allah bestowed His favour on you, so carefully investigate. Allah is certainly informed about what you do"}
