{"chapter":4,"verse":25,"text":"And whoever among you is not able to afford to marry free believing women, then (he may marry) from those whom your right hands possess from among your believing maids, and Allah knows best your belief, you are one from another, so marry the (maids) with the permission of their people and give them their dowries in a recognised (good manner), they should be chaste not fornicatresses nor those who take lovers. And when the (maids) are taken in wedlock and (then) if they commit an indecency, then on them is half of the punishment of that on free women. This (permission to marry slave girls) is for him among you who fears falling into distress, but it is better for you if you are patient, and Allah is Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"}
