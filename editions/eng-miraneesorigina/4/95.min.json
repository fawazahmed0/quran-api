{"chapter":4,"verse":95,"text":"Those believers who sit (at home) without receiving any injury are not equal to those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth and their persons. Allah has been more gracious to those who strive with their wealth and their persons by (giving them a higher) rank over those who sit (at home), and to each Allah has promised good but Allah has been more gracious to those who strive, by giving them a greater reward compared to those who sit (at home)"}
