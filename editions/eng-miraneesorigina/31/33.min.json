{"chapter":31,"verse":33,"text":"O mankind! be careful of your Fosterer and fear the day when a father will not be able to pay for the penalty on behalf of his son, and the son will not be able to pay for anything by way of penalty on behalf of his father. Allah’s promise is certainly true, so do not let the life of this world deceive you nor let the deceiver deceive you about Allah"}
