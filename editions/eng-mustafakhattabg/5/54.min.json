{"chapter":5,"verse":54,"text":"O believers! Whoever among you abandons their faith, God will replace them with others who love Him and are loved by Him. They will be humble with the believers but firm towards the disbelievers, struggling in the Way of God; fearing no blame from anyone. This is the favour of God. He grants it to whoever He wills. And God is All-Bountiful, All-Knowing"}
