{"chapter":9,"verse":3,"text":"A declaration from God and His Messenger ˹is made˺ to all people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that God and His Messenger are free of the polytheists. So if you ˹pagans˺ repent, it will be better for you. But if you turn away, then know that you will have no escape from God. And give good news ˹O Prophet˺ to the disbelievers of a painful punishment"}
