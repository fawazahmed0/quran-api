{"chapter":9,"verse":24,"text":"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If your parents and children and siblings and spouses and extended family and the wealth you have acquired and the trade you fear will decline and the homes you cherish—˹if all these˺ are more beloved to you than God and His Messenger and struggling in His Way, then wait until God brings about His Will. God does not guide the rebellious people.”"}
