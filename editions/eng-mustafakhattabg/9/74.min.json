{"chapter":9,"verse":74,"text":"They swear by God that they never said anything ˹blasphemous˺, while they did in fact utter a blasphemy, lost faith after accepting Islam, and plotted what they could not carry out. It is only through resentment that they pay God and His Messenger back for enriching them out of His bounty! If they repent, it will be better for them. But if they turn away, God will torment them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no one on earth to protect or help them"}
