{"chapter":42,"verse":15,"text":"Because of that, you ˹O Prophet˺ will invite ˹all˺. Be steadfast as you are commanded, and do not follow their desires. And say, “I believe in every Scripture God has revealed. And I am commanded to judge fairly among you. God is our Lord and your Lord. We will be accountable for our deeds and you for yours. There is no ˹need for˺ contention between us. God will gather us together ˹for judgment˺. And to Him is the final return.”"}
