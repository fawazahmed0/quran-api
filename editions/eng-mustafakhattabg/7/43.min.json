{"chapter":7,"verse":43,"text":"We will remove whatever bitterness they had in their hearts. Rivers will flow under their feet. And they will say, “Praise be to God for guiding us to this. We would have never been guided if God had not guided us. The messengers of our Lord had certainly come with the truth.” It will be announced to them, “This is Paradise awarded to you for what you used to do.”"}
