{"chapter":7,"verse":158,"text":"Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “O humanity! I am God’s Messenger to you all. To Him ˹alone˺ belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. There is no god ˹worthy of worship˺ except Him. He gives life and causes death.” So believe in God and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in God and His revelations. And follow him, so you may be ˹rightly˺ guided"}
