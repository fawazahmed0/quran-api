{"chapter":11,"verse":31,"text":"I do not say to you that I possess God’s treasuries or know the unseen, nor do I claim to be an angel, nor do I say that God will never grant goodness to those you look down upon. God knows best what is ˹hidden˺ within them. ˹If I did,˺ then I would truly be one of the wrongdoers.”"}
