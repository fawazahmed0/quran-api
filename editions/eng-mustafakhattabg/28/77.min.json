{"chapter":28,"verse":77,"text":"Rather, seek the ˹reward˺ of the Hereafter by means of what God has granted you, without forgetting your share of this world. And be good ˹to others˺ as God has been good to you. Do not seek to spread corruption in the land, for God certainly does not like the corruptors.”"}
