{"chapter":65,"verse":1,"text":"O Prophet! ˹Instruct the believers:˺ When you ˹intend to˺ divorce women, then divorce them with concern for their waiting period, and count it accurately. And fear God, your Lord. Do not force them out of their homes, nor should they leave—unless they commit a blatant misconduct. These are the limits set by God. And whoever transgresses God’s limits has truly wronged his own soul. You never know, perhaps God will bring about a change ˹of heart˺ later"}
