{"pages":[{"chapter":73,"verse":20,"text":"Surely your Lord knows that you ˹O Prophet˺ stand ˹in prayer˺ for nearly two-thirds of the night, or ˹sometimes˺ half of it, or a third, as do some of those with you. God ˹alone˺ keeps a ˹precise˺ measure of the day and night. He knows that you ˹believers˺ are unable to endure this, and has turned to you in mercy. So recite ˹in prayer˺ whatever you can from the Quran. He knows that some of you will be sick, some will be travelling throughout the land seeking God’s bounty, and some fighting in the cause of God. So recite whatever you can from it. And ˹continue to˺ perform ˹regular˺ prayers, pay alms-tax, and lend to God a good loan. Whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with God far better and more rewarding. And seek God’s forgiveness. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"},{"chapter":74,"verse":1,"text":"O you covered up ˹in your clothes˺"},{"chapter":74,"verse":2,"text":"Arise and warn ˹all˺"},{"chapter":74,"verse":3,"text":"Revere your Lord ˹alone˺"},{"chapter":74,"verse":4,"text":"Purify your garments"},{"chapter":74,"verse":5,"text":"˹Continue to˺ shun idols"},{"chapter":74,"verse":6,"text":"Do not do a favour expecting more ˹in return˺"},{"chapter":74,"verse":7,"text":"And persevere for ˹the sake of˺ your Lord"},{"chapter":74,"verse":8,"text":"˹For˺ when the Trumpet will be sounded"},{"chapter":74,"verse":9,"text":"that will ˹truly˺ be a difficult Day—"},{"chapter":74,"verse":10,"text":"far from easy for the disbelievers"},{"chapter":74,"verse":11,"text":"And leave to me ˹O Prophet˺ the one I created all by Myself"},{"chapter":74,"verse":12,"text":"and granted him abundant wealth"},{"chapter":74,"verse":13,"text":"and children always by his side"},{"chapter":74,"verse":14,"text":"and made life very easy for him"},{"chapter":74,"verse":15,"text":"Yet he is hungry for more"},{"chapter":74,"verse":16,"text":"But no! ˹For˺ he has been truly stubborn with Our revelations"},{"chapter":74,"verse":17,"text":"I will make his fate unbearable"}]}
