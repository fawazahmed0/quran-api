{"maqras":[{"chapter":5,"verse":41,"text":"O Messenger! Do not grieve for those who race to disbelieve—those who say, “We believe” with their tongues, but their hearts are in disbelief. Nor those among the Jews who eagerly listen to lies, attentive to those who are too arrogant to come to you. They distort the Scripture, taking rulings out of context, then say, “If this is the ruling you get ˹from Muḥammad˺, accept it. If not, beware!” Whoever God allows to be deluded, you can never be of any help to them against God. It is not God’s Will to purify their hearts. For them is disgrace in this world, and they will suffer a tremendous punishment in the Hereafter"},{"chapter":5,"verse":42,"text":"They eagerly listen to falsehood and consume forbidden gain. So if they come to you ˹O Prophet˺, either judge between them or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot harm you whatsoever. But if you judge between them, then do so with justice. Surely God loves those who are just"},{"chapter":5,"verse":43,"text":"But why do they come to you for judgment when they ˹already˺ have the Torah containing God’s judgment, then they turn away after all? They are not ˹true˺ believers"},{"chapter":5,"verse":44,"text":"Indeed, We revealed the Torah, containing guidance and light, by which the prophets, who submitted themselves to God, made judgments for Jews. So too did the rabbis and scholars judge according to God’s Book, with which they were entrusted and of which they were made keepers. So do not fear the people; fear Me! Nor trade my revelations for a fleeting gain. And those who do not judge by what God has revealed are ˹truly˺ the disbelievers"},{"chapter":5,"verse":45,"text":"We ordained for them in the Torah, “A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth—and for wounds equal retaliation.” But whoever waives it charitably, it will be atonement for them. And those who do not judge by what God has revealed are ˹truly˺ the wrongdoers"},{"chapter":5,"verse":46,"text":"Then in the footsteps of the prophets, We sent Jesus, son of Mary, confirming the Torah revealed before him. And We gave him the Gospel containing guidance and light and confirming what was revealed in the Torah—a guide and a lesson to the God-fearing"},{"chapter":5,"verse":47,"text":"So let the people of the Gospel judge by what God has revealed in it. And those who do not judge by what God has revealed are ˹truly˺ the rebellious"},{"chapter":5,"verse":48,"text":"We have revealed to you ˹O Prophet˺ this Book with the truth, as a confirmation of previous Scriptures and a supreme authority on them. So judge between them by what God has revealed, and do not follow their desires over the truth that has come to you. To each of you We have ordained a code of law and a way of life. If God had willed, He would have made you one community, but His Will is to test you with what He has given ˹each of˺ you. So compete with one another in doing good. To God you will all return, then He will inform you ˹of the truth˺ regarding your differences"},{"chapter":5,"verse":49,"text":"And judge between them ˹O Prophet˺ by what God has revealed, and do not follow their desires. And beware, so they do not lure you away from some of what God has revealed to you. If they turn away ˹from God’s judgment˺, then know that it is God’s Will to repay them for some of their sins, and that many people are indeed rebellious"},{"chapter":5,"verse":50,"text":"Is it the judgment of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance they seek?
