And God is All-Aware of what you do"},{"chapter":3,"verse":154,"text":"Then after distress, He sent down serenity in the form of drowsiness overcoming some of you, while others were disturbed by evil thoughts about God—the thoughts of ˹pre-Islamic˺ ignorance. They ask, “Do we have a say in the matter?” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “All matters are destined by God.” They conceal in their hearts what they do not reveal to you. They say ˹to themselves˺, “If we had any say in the matter, none of us would have come to die here.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “Even if you were to remain in your homes, those among you who were destined to be killed would have met the same fate.” Through this, God tests what is within you and purifies what is in your hearts. And God knows best what is ˹hidden˺ in the heart"},{"chapter":3,"verse":155,"text":"Indeed, those ˹believers˺ who fled on the day when the two armies met were made to slip by Satan because of their misdeeds.

Do not be like the unfaithful who say about their brothers who travel throughout the land or engage in battle, “If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” God makes such thinking a cause of agony in their hearts. It is God who gives life and causes death. And God is All-Seeing of what you do"},{"chapter":3,"verse":157,"text":"Should you be martyred or die in the cause of God, then His forgiveness and mercy are far better than whatever ˹wealth˺ those ˹who stay behind˺ accumulate"},{"chapter":3,"verse":158,"text":"Whether you die or are martyred—all of you will be gathered before God"},{"chapter":3,"verse":159,"text":"It is out of God’s mercy that you ˹O Prophet˺ have been lenient with them.

Once you make a decision, put your trust in God. Surely God loves those who trust in Him"},{"chapter":3,"verse":160,"text":"If God helps you, none can defeat you.
