{"chapter":8,"verse":72,"text":"Those who believed, emigrated, and strived with their wealth and lives in the cause of God, as well as those who gave them shelter and help—they are truly guardians of one another. As for those who believed but did not emigrate, you have no obligations to them until they emigrate. But if they seek your help ˹against persecution˺ in faith, it is your obligation to help them, except against people bound with you in a treaty. God is All-Seeing of what you do"}
