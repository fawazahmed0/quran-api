{"chapter":39,"verse":38,"text":"If you ask them ˹O Prophet˺ who created the heavens and the earth, they will certainly say, “God!” Ask ˹them˺, “Consider then whatever ˹idols˺ you invoke besides God: if it was God’s Will to harm me, could they undo that harm? Or if He willed ˹some˺ mercy for me, could they withhold His mercy?” Say, “God is sufficient for me. In Him ˹alone˺ the faithful put their trust.”"}
