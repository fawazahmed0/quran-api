{"chapter":3,"verse":180,"text":"And do not let those who ˹greedily˺ withhold God’s bounties think it is good for them—in fact, it is bad for them! They will be leashed ˹by their necks˺ on the Day of Judgment with whatever ˹wealth˺ they used to withhold. And God is the ˹sole˺ inheritor of the heavens and the earth. And God is All-Aware of what you do"}
