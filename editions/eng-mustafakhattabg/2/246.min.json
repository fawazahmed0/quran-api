{"chapter":2,"verse":246,"text":"Have you not seen those chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses? They said to one of their prophets, “Appoint for us a king, ˹and˺ we will fight in the cause of God.” He said, “Are you not going to cower if ordered to fight?” They replied, “How could we refuse to fight in the cause of God, while we were driven out of our homes and ˹separated from˺ our children?” But when they were ordered to fight, they fled, except for a few of them. And God has ˹perfect˺ knowledge of the wrongdoers"}
