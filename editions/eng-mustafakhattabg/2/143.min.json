{"chapter":2,"verse":143,"text":"And so We have made you ˹believers˺ an upright community so that you may be witnesses over humanity and that the Messenger may be a witness over you. We assigned your former direction of prayer only to distinguish those who would remain faithful to the Messenger from those who would lose faith. It was certainly a difficult test except for those ˹rightly˺ guided by God. And God would never discount your ˹previous acts of˺ faith. Surely God is Ever Gracious and Most Merciful to humanity"}
