{"chapter":24,"verse":62,"text":"The ˹true˺ believers are only those who believe in God and His Messenger, and when they are with him on a public matter, they do not leave without his permission. Indeed, those who ask your permission ˹O Prophet˺ are the ones who ˹truly˺ believe in God and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for a private matter, grant permission to whoever you wish and ask God’s forgiveness for them. Surely God is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful"}
