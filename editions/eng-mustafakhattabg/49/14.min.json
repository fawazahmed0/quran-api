{"chapter":49,"verse":14,"text":"˹Some of˺ the nomadic Arabs say, “We believe.” Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “You have not believed. But say, ‘We have submitted,’ for faith has not yet entered your hearts. But if you obey God and His Messenger ˹wholeheartedly˺, He will not discount anything from ˹the reward of˺ your deeds. God is truly All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”"}
