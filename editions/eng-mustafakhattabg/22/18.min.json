{"chapter":22,"verse":18,"text":"Do you not see that to God bow down ˹in submission˺ all those in the heavens and all those on the earth, as well as the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, and ˹all˺ living beings, as well as many humans, while many are deserving of punishment. And whoever God disgraces, none can honour. Surely God does what He wills"}
