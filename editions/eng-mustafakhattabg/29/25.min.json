{"chapter":29,"verse":25,"text":"He said ˹to his people˺, “You have taken idols ˹for worship˺ instead of God, only to keep ˹the bond of˺ harmony among yourselves in this worldly life. But on the Day of Judgment you will disown and curse one another. Your home will be the Fire, and you will have no helper!”"}
