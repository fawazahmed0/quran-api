{"chapter":14,"verse":9,"text":"Has the news of those before you not come to you: people of Nuh and Aad and Samood and those after them? They do not know them but Allah (knows). Their messengers came to them with clear proofs but they thrust their hands in their mouths and said, “We certainly do not believe in that which you are sent with, and we are certainly in doubt causing restlessness, about that which you call us to.”"}
