{"chapter":28,"verse":82,"text":"And in the morning, those who had longed for his position (only) the day before, (were heard) saying, “Ah! (it is) God Who enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His servants and straitens (for whomever and whenever He wills). Had God not been gracious to us, He would have caused the sinking along with us. Ah! the ungrateful are not successful.”"}
