{"chapter":60,"verse":12,"text":"O prophet! when believing women come to you to take an oath of allegiance unto you that they will not associate anything with God and they will not steal and they will not commit adultery and they will not kill their children and they will not come with a false charge (on someone), forging it between their hands and their feet, and they will not disobey you in (what) is recognised (as good), then accept their allegiance and ask God for their protective forgiveness, God is certainly Protectively Forgiving, Merciful"}
