{"chapter":60,"verse":1,"text":"O you who believe! do not take My enemy and your enemy as friends offering them love while they reject that which has come to you of the truth, driving out the messenger and you (just) because you believe in Allah your Fosterer. If you have come out for striving in My way and seeking My pleasure (why) do you offer them love in secret? And I know best that which you hide and that which you make public. And whoever from among you does that, then he has indeed gone astray from the balanced way"}
