{"chapter":3,"verse":103,"text":"And hold together (and be united) through the rope of God and do not be divided. And remember the favour of God on you, when you were enemies then He united your hearts, so by His favour you became brothers, and you were on the edge of a pit of fire then He saved you from it, thus does God make clear to you His signs that you may receive guidance"}
