{"chapter":58,"verse":22,"text":"You will not find a people who believe in God and the period hereafter, loving those who resist God and His messenger, even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their relatives (and friends). Those are the persons in whose hearts He has written down belief and has strengthened them with a spirit from Him. And He will make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow, to stay therein, God pleased with them and they pleased with Him. Those are (the members of) the team of God. Beware ! (the members of) the team of God, they are the successful ones"}
