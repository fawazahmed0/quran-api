{"chapter":39,"verse":23,"text":"God has sent down the best statements (in the form of) a book, (these statements are) similar (to each other and not contradictory and are) repeated. The skins of those who fear their Lord tremble (in response to the effect produced) by it, then their skins and their hearts soften towards the remembrance of God. That is guidance of God, He guides through it whom He wills, and whom God leaves to stray then there is no guide for him"}
