{"chapter":39,"verse":8,"text":"And when harm afflicts man, he prays to his Lord turning towards Him, then when He grants to him favor from Him, he forgets (even) that for which he had prayed to Him earlier, and sets up equals for God that he may mislead (people) from His way. Say, “Enjoy a little in your ingratitude, you will certainly be among the inhabitants of the fire.”"}
