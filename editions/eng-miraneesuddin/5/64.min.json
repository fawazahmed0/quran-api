{"chapter":5,"verse":64,"text":"The Jews say, \"God's hand is tied up.\" Their hands be tied up and they be cursed because of what they say. No ! both His hands are spread out, He spends as He wills. And that which is sent down to you from your Lord will definitely increase rebellion and disbelief in many of them. And We have put enemity and hatred among them till the day of resurrection. Whenever they kindle a fire for war God extinguishes it and they strive for corruption in the earth and God does not like those who are corrupt"}
