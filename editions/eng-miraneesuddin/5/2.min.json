{"chapter":5,"verse":2,"text":"O you who believe ! do not violate the sanctity of the symbols of Allah nor the sacred month nor the offerings nor the victims with garlands nor those resorting to the Sacred House seeking the grace and pleasure of their Fosterer. And when you have removed your pilgrim dress (and are free from the obligations of the pilgrimage) then (you may) hunt. And do not let the hatred of a people who turned you away from the Sacred Mosque (earlier), incite you to exceed the limits. And help one another in righteousness and guarding (against evil) but do not help one another in sin and transgression and fear Allah, Allah is certainly severe in requiting (evil)"}
