{"chapter":4,"verse":141,"text":"(There are) those who wait for you, so if you get a victory from Allah, they say, \"Were we not with you?\" And if the share (of victory) is for the infidels, they say (to the infidels), \"Did we not have mastery over you and protect you from the believers?\" So Allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection. And Allah will not give the infidels a way (of dominance) over the believers"}
