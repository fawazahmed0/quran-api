{"chapter":2,"verse":185,"text":"(It was the) month of Ramazan, during which the Quran was sent down (for the) guidance of human beings, and it (contains) clear explanations of the guidance and the distinction (between right and wrong). So whoever among you is present in the month of (Ramadan), let him then fast, and whoever is sick or on journey then (he should fast for the missed) number of days later. God intends ease for you and He does not intend hardship for you, and (this concession is given so) that you should complete the (required) number (of days), and that you should regard God Great for having guided you and that you should be grateful"}
