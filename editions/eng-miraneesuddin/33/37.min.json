{"chapter":33,"verse":37,"text":"And when you said to him (Zaid) whom God had favored and whom you (too) had favored, “Retain your wife with you and fear God.” And you kept secret in your soul that which God was to expose and you did fear human beings while God has the greater right that you should fear Him. Then, when Zaid fulfilled the necessary (formalities) of (divorcing) her, We joined her to you in marriage, so that there should be no blame on the believers in marrying the wives of their adopted sons, when they fulfill the necessary (formalities) of (divorcing) them, and the order of God was to be executed"}
